More Antiantijokes need to end like this. The man only left because it was crowded in there, from all the "Walks into a bar" Antiantijokes there are. Just because an infinite number of mathematicians can fit into the bar doesn't mean it should contain an infinite number of individuals. For fucks sake people, there's only a single Bartender, how's he supposed to tend to all the patrons in there.Anyways, the bartender, sick of tending to all the patrons in the bar, pulled out a gun with an infinite amount of ammunition, and shot himself in the head. The first of a set of an infinite number of mathematicians took his place. However, after doing the math, the mathematician came to the conclusion that tending to all the patrons was mathematically impossible. He picked up the gun, but the second of a set of an infinite number of mathematicians asked how he knew he was the first of a set of an infinite number of mathematicians, and not, say for example the seven hundred twenty six nonillion three hundred twenty nine octillion five hundred seventy two heptillion six hundred fifty eight hexillion seven hundred forty seven quintillion two hundred eighteen quadrillion seventy one trillion four hundred six billion nine hundred ninety nine million six hundred and sixty sixth mathematician. The first mathematician, confused at how the second came up with such a small number, told him that the numbering system was completely arbitrary; he's the first because he decided he would be the lowest numbered mathematician, and the second is the second, because he was the first mathematician he saw that wasn't himself. The first mathematician then shoots himself in the head, leaving the second mathematician to become the first.The new first mathematician comes to the same mathematical conclusion that the previous, being that it would be mathematically  impossible to serve every patron in the bar. He picked up the gun, but the new second of a set of an infinite number of mathematicians asks how he knows he's the first of a set of an infinite number of mathematicians, and not yet another arbitrarily small number. The first mathematician gives the same answer as the previous first mathematician, then shoots himself in the head.This cycle continues until we reach the final first of a set of an infinite number of mathematicians. He comes to the same conclusion the previous infinity mathematicians about serving all the patrons being impossible, and picks up the gun. However, since there is no new second mathematician to ask him how he knows he's the first mathematician, and not some arbitrarily small number, he is able to answer the question by stating that he's the only mathematician left from the set of an infinite number of mathematicians, and puts the gun down.There is, however, a second unique set of an infinite number of mathematicians in the bar. The first mathematician from the previous set attempts to use the gun to shoot them all, but discovers that the gun is out of ammunition. The first mathematician of the second set of an infinite number of mathematicians asks for 1 beer, the second asks for half a beer, the third asks for a quarter of a beer. The first mathematician from the first set of an infinite number of mathematicians puts 2 beers on the counter, and tell the infinite number of mathematicians to split the beer among themselves. The first mathematician from the first set of an infinite number of mathematicians the exits the bar.The first mathematician encounters the man who walked into the bar earlier, but left, and tells the man that there are an infinite and one fewer people in the bar, so it should be far less crowded. The man then walks into the bar, and finds an infinite number of dead people lying at the counter. He tries to order a beer, but finds there are no bartenders. He finds the set of an infinite number of mathematicians arguing over who's the nine hundred twenty seven billion six hundred ninety two million eight hundred six thousand and twenty seventh mathematician, and who's the nine hundred twenty seven billion six hundred ninety two million eight hundred six thousand and twenty eighth mathematician. The man kindly asks the set of an infinite number of mathematicians where the bartender went. The four hundred sixty seventh mathematician tells him that the bartender's had his limit, and does not exist. <|endoftext|>

A low, unholy gurgle escapes her lips.  Her eyes turn a glassy white and her skin a sallow green.  The other nuns at the table start to stand up and back away, but she throws her head back and a battery of devilish spikes emerge from inside her throat.  They run, but the spikes explode out from the beast, embedding into the bodies of the nuns, the bartender, all the patrons in the crossfire unable to flee.The bartender clutches his impaled shoulder, watching the second and third nuns choke and convulse in front of him.  He feels the toxins course though his own veins and accepts his death.  The fourth nun crawls towards him on all fours, and he can see its jaw unhinge like an angler fish through his blurring vision.  Its putrid breath hits his nostrils.  But suddenly, the First Nun stands up, seemingly unharmed.  She pounces from behind, wrapping a rosary around the neck of the beast, shouting into its ear a prayer the likes of which the bartender has never heard.  The beast screams, and its flesh smokes, and it wrestles and fights for its impure life dragging the First Nun behind the bar.After a moment the First Nun emerges, battered but victorious.  She limps to the still conscious bartender and presses the small whiskey bottle to his lips.  "Not alcohol.  It's antivenom.  Drink."  He obeys.  After a minute he feels fine.  He surveys the destruction around him, the two dead nuns, and despite his gratitude he can't help but ask the one burning question in his mind.He points to the thing behind the bar and asks "what the hell is that?"The First Nun watches as a fifth nun walks into the bar wearing a neatly pressed suit and tie, carrying a briefcase.  "That's Nun of your Business." <|endoftext|>

Could I possibly swing the gun like a club and knock the knife out of his hand? What does the law say about this situation?   Does the pistol have appropriate safety built into it? Why am I carrying a loaded gun anyway, and what kind of message does this send to society and to my children? Is it possible he'd be happy with just killing me?

The party of the first part (Lawyer) shall, with or without elevation, at his option, by means of a chair, stepstool, ladder, or any other means of elevation, grasp the party of the second part (Light Bulb) and rotate the party of the second part (Light Bulb) in a counterclockwise direction, said direction being non- negotiable.

The foregoing notwithstanding, however, both parties stipulate that structural failure of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) may be incidental to the aforementioned failure to perform, and in such case the party of the first part (Lawyer) shall be held blameless for such structural failure insofar as this agreement is concerned so long as the non-negotiable directional codicil (counterclockwise) is observed by the party of the first part (Lawyer) throughout.2.) Upon reaching a point where the party of the second part (Light Bulb) becomes separated from the party of the third part (“Receptacle”), the party of the first part (Lawyer) shall have the option of disposing of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) in a manner consistent with all applicable state, local, and federal statutes.3.)

This installation shall occur in a manner consistent with the reverse of the procedures described in Step 1 of this document, being careful to note that the rotation should occur in a clockwise direction, said direction also being non-negotiable.NOTE: The above-described steps may be performed, at the option of the party of the first part (Lawyer), by said party of the first part (Lawyer), by his heirs and assigns, or by any and all persons authorized by him to do so, the objective being to produce a level of illumination in the immediate vicinity of the aforementioned front (north) door consistent with maximization of commerce and revenue for the party of the fifth part, also known as “The Firm.” <|endoftext|>

In short, I feel thatLeshrac absolutely needs a nerf, lightning shorter cast range, his ult lower damage output at higher levels, lower the scale a little? Stun and edict are okay, I think.Gyro is simply in a good spot, I don't consider him over powered, just one of the best or the best for his position. To even it out a bit I think changing flak cannon to slow down his immense farming speed would make sense, and maybe raise cd on his ultimate so he can't literally farm all day then make every fight- it seems he gets best of both worlds right now in this meta.Bounty is a hero I did not think was too strong but he apparently is the go-to for any type of team that needs a midgame snowball. Lower track gold bonus, then? Although I hate the hero personally I think he's in an ok spot, not too strong.Bloodseeker, q damage should be lowered, i think the potential is too high and to simply dive a t3 and find a kill at 4 minutes in the game is absurd. This, of course is also to blame from his thirst ability, I think the numbers should be lowered a bit there as well. I'm on moble and too lazy to lookSF agi I think could be nerfed to not let him scale so well into the late game. I think that is partly why he is picked so much, he is good early with some help then is great all game, generally speaking.Qop is suddenly strong, I at one point thought that if a hero stuns her mid-cast of her blink ability it would not reset the cooldown and she would not blink at all. Just a concept that wouldnt throw her out and make the blink a little bit closer to the actual item. Because her animation is so long this would be possible. For antimage this could be possible too, to treat his popularity in ti5 but I don't think he's too strong at all and his blink cast is far less predictable and would be harder to stop.Dazzle is okay. WW is okay, the fact that her ult goes through bkb is strong but removing that would be too heavy of a nerf. Buffs? Personally, (well, these are the heroes I want to play personally but I think are too weak right now) terrorblade, alchemist.Naga support in my opinion is simply a phase and it does not need a nerf, if anything net time reduced. And maybe base intel.Any hero I missed?Discuss if you please. In advance sorry for typos or mistakes, on mobile <|endoftext|>

King Arthur was getting ready to go on a Quest. He was worried about leaving his beautiful Queen Guinevere alone with all those lonely Knights of the Round Table. So he went to his famous wizard, Merlin, for some advice. After explaining his predicament to Merlin, the wizard looked thoughtful and said to come back in a week and he’d see if he could come up with something. A week later King Arthur was back in Merlin’s laboratory where the good wizard was showing him his latest invention. It was a chastity belt... except it had a rather large hole in the most obvious place. "This is no good, Merlin!" the king exclaimed, "Look at this opening. How is this supposed to protect m’lady, the Queen?" "Ah, sire, just observe." said Merlin as he searched his cluttered workbench until he found what he was looking for. He then selected his most worn out wand, one that he was going to discard anyway. He then inserted it in the gaping aperture of the chastity belt whereupon a small guillotine blade came down and cut it neatly in two. "Merlin, you are a genius!" said the grateful monarch, "Now I can leave, knowing that my Queen is fully protected." After putting Guinevere in the device, King Arthur then set out upon his Quest. Several years passed until he returned to Camelot. Immediately he assembled all his knights in the courtyard and had them drop their trousers for an informal ’short arm’ inspection. Sure enough! Each and every one of them was either amputated or damaged in some way. All of them, except Sir Galahad. "Sir Galahad," exclaimed King Arthur, "The one and only true knight! Only you among all the nobles have been true to me. What is it in my power to grant you? Name it and it is yours!" But Sir Galahad was speechless. <|endoftext|>

It's very obvious! It's your gait and that shit-eating grin of yours. Only a motherfucker walks into an establishment in a manner such as yours, as if looking for someone's mother to fuck but I digress. I'd like to hire your services. An old acquaintance of mine, a fellow nobleman has insulted me and caused harm to my sensitivities with a vulgar and unflattering letter. I need you to locate his estate, seduce and then fuck his mother in response, at my behest, motherfucker. I'll pay 20 in coin for you to undertake this quest, then 100 upon completion of this important endeavour. Will you accept?"The motherfucker accepts the nobleman's offer. After receiving directions to the target's home, the motherfucker ventures out to fulfill his motherfucking contract. As he walks the "King's Road" he hears someone shouting: "Stop! Hold it right there, you fucker of mothers! Cease your movement of legs to gain forward momentum, by the order of the king!" The motherfucker sighs and turns around to face three knights on horseback."How are you able to discern that I am indeed a fucker of mothers?" Asks the motherfucker, now slightly irritated.The lead knight scoffs and replies: "Only experienced motherfuckers such as yourself thrust their pelvises for each step they take. That goulish, wide grin isn't doing you any favours either, motherfucker."The motherfucker, grinning even when frustrated, replies: "By the heavens, I guess discretion is not my strong suit, rather fucking mothers is.""Silence, you insufferable fornicator of mothers! I loathe you people, you better not fuck any of ours while out here. I can tell by the brisk in your walk and the vigor of your crotch movements that you're on a mission as we speak. Carry on then, motherfucker! You best stay away from mine!" The lead knight remarks before he spits onto the paved road. "You people are worse than rapists! I'll make you pay a toll the next time we cross paths on this road!" He says finally, before the knights carry on ridingThe motherfucker continues to travel, feeling a bit discouraged now. At some point, he crosses paths with a farmer that simply says: "Good evening, motherfucker." The motherfucker rolls his eyes and tries to adjust the way he moves and also trains on maintaining a blank facial expression during the remainder of his trip. After two hours, he finally reaches the manor that was described by the nobleman.He inhales and exhales once deeply and walks through a yard leading to the manor. He has already rehearsed his lines, planning on pretending to be a tradesman. The other targeted nobleman promptly rushes outside, seemingly enraged and yells: "You motherfucker, you! Stay where you are!"The motherfucker almost wails in frustration as he yells back: "Come on! What?! How can you possibly already be aware that I'm here to fuck your mother?!"The nobleman replies: "What?! No, don't come any closer unless you have a pair of glasses to put on, you fucking moron. You have stepped on numerous flowerbeds that are filled with my prized tulips!" <|endoftext|>

I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say, "Happy Birthday!", and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone "Happy Birthday." I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... They will remember. My kids came bounding down stairs to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent.As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said, "Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!" It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered. I worked until one o'clock, when Jane knocked on my door and said, "You know, It's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your Birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me." I said, "Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!" We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go. She chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table. We had two Martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously. On the way back to the office, Jane said, "You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't need to go straight back to the office, do we?" I responded, "I guess not. What do you have in mind?" She said, "Let's drop by my apartment, it's just around the corner." After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said, "Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back." "Okay," I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake. Followed by my wife, my kids, and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing "Happy birthday". And I just sat there... On the couch... Sobbing... Naked... and erect.Thank you sparkie1886 for the joke. <|endoftext|>

There was once a train operator who had been driving trains for well over 20 years. Over the course of his career, he had experienced a number of close calls in the accident department. At long last, sadly, he hit a schoolbus full of children on its way out of the elementary school parking lot, killing every single one of them.Unsurprisingly, he was put on trial for a number of counts of manslaughter in the first degree. After several hours of deliberation, he was convicted and the judge sentenced him to death by means of the electric chair. For his last meal, the unskilled train driver requested his grandmother's homemade macaroni and cheese. The warden of his temporarily assigned prison was hesitant at first, but eventually agreed that it was the least he could do for the man who was going to die in a few hours.After scarfing down his grandmother's meal and saying his goodbyes, the man was brought to the electric chair. The executioner strapped him in and threw the switch. Three times they tried to electrocute the man. Three times it failed. Not knowing what to do, the befuddled executioner unstrapped him and led him out of the room to attempt a different means of execution.On the way out, the veteran guard at the door insisted on asking the man how he had possibly survived the electric chair. In all his years of working, he had never seen a single person survive such a fate. He asked: "How'd you do it, man? Was it your grandmother's macaroni? Are you some sort of messiah? What's your secret?"The man shrugged his shoulders, scratched his head, and thought for a moment. Finally, he replied:"No secret. I suppose I'm just a bad conductor, that's all." <|endoftext|>

The following is an actual question given on a University of Washington engineering mid-term. The answer was so "profound" that the Professor shared it with colleagues, and the sharing obviously hasn't ceased...Bonus Question: Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or Endothermic (absorbs heat)?Most of the students wrote Proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law, (gas cools off when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or some variant. One student, however, wrote the following:"First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let us look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially.Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are added. This gives two possibilities:1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.2. Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.So which is it?If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa Banyan during my Freshman year, "...that it will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you.", and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then, #2 cannot be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and will not freeze."This student received the only A. <|endoftext|>

Yo ~~mama~~ guys, I know I haven't posted here in a while. I haven't had much time to write much of anything recently, and I'm hoping I can restart that passion soon, since I remember I had a lot of fun making antiantijokes.

Earlier this year, I wrote an antiantijoke-like short story, revolving around 20 "jokes" that start off fairly normal but gradually progress into absurdist existential horror. I called it "Twenty Jokes That'll Make You Go 'Karblowza!'," and it was originally meant to be published in physical form with illustrations, but that idea never came to fruition. I read it again recently and was wondering if you guys would be interested in reading it too.

I know this isn't a typical r/AntiAntiJokes post but I just wanna make sure I'm not posting unwanted material here.

Having conducted trains for over 20 years, today was just like any other day. He pulled up to a stop and gently brought the train to a halt . As the doors open, passengers enter. He goes to close the doors and as he does an old man is slowly racing for the train.He trips, falling onto the tracks.Seeing this, the conductor snaps, and drives the train over the old man.2 years pass. The conductor is sitting on death row, moments before he is due to be electrocuted. A guard comes in, and asks what he would like for his last meal?“Just one banana.” Says the man. The guard is confused.“You can have anything, sir.” Says the guard. “The finest banana you can find.” Says the man. A few moments pass, and the guard approaches the conductors cell.“One banana. The best I could find.”And so, the conductor proceeds to eat the banana. Extremely slowly. He peels off the skin, those little dangly bits, and eventually every last bit.“Are you finished?” Says the guard.“Yes” says the man.He is taken to the electric chair. There is priest praying on behalf of the man. And once the word is given, a guard presses a button and engages the shock.Nothing happens.The mans lawyer is there. He argues that the man has received his punishment.He wins this case, and is set free.*Years pass, the man is, somehow, back behind the console of a large train. Significantly older now.It’s a normal day, and he is driving the train. As he comes to a halt and let’s passengers on, a young pregnant woman is rushing to make the train. She trips onto the tracks.The conductor snaps, and runs over the lady.A year has passed. The man is, again, on death row awaiting electrocution. A guard approached the cell.“What’ll it be?” The guard says. “One banana please.” Says the man. “Again?” Says the guard. “The finest banana you can find.” Says the man.Sure enough, the guard returns shortly after with an amazing banana. It’s shiny and fresh and better than before. The man takes his time to eat the banana, slowly peeling back the skin and finishing it off.“Ready” says the guard.“Yes.” Says the man.Just like before, the man is taken to an even better electric chair. He is strapped in 10 times tighter with double the connections.“He won’t get away this time” says the head guard.They press a button, sending a lethal amount of electricity to the man, but yet again fails to kill him.“How can this be happening!” They all exclaim.And because the laws in this region are broken, the man is again free to go.*A few months later, the man has escaped to a far part of the world. Managing to hide his identity and get a job as a train conductor.He’s driving along one day, just as normal, he’s extremely old now and can barely see.  All of a sudden, someone jumps in front of the train.Despite it being an accident, because of his track record the man is again sent to death row.The time has come, it’s a year later, decades before the first time and the man is in the exact same cell as before.“I don’t know how this keeps happening. But here is your banana.” The guard says.“Thank you.” Says the man.It’s now the moment of truth, if this does not work a third time the man has beaten the system and once again sent free.He’s sitting in the electric chair, the priest cannot bring himself to say a prayer to this monster. Every guard in the prison is surrounding the man as he is strapped into the chair in every way possible.The head guard walks over to the control panel, sweat dripping down his face. Everyone is looking at him, anxiously awaiting the moment the life leaves the mans eyes.He presses a button.Nothing...........“HOW ARE YOU STILL ALIVE?” Says the guard in a rage of confusion. The man sits still, and looks the guard straight in his eyes, and finally opens his mouth after a long moment and says: “I’m just not a very good conductor.” <|endoftext|>

He notices that and Goes to his parents room, where there was only his mother, he tries to wake her up, but she ignores him, and so because his dad was nowhere to be found he goes to the maids room, where he sees his dad screwing the maid, so he goes back to his moms room and tries to wake her up again, and she still ignored him...

He goes to his dad and says:DAD! I think I understand this whole politics thing now... Wanna hear? Dad goes "SURE!!!"So the people of the country are trying their best to sleep soundly at night and to alarm the government of the fact that the President is screwing the working class, But the government ignores this deal and continues to sleep like a log, and it's now that I realize that our future is full of shit! <|endoftext|>

Then he reviewed the past evening.As he gained a little more courage he then inquired of her. “When I asked if you would marry me, did you say “Yes” or did you say “No?”“Why you silly man, I said ‘Yes. Yes I will.’ And I meant it with all my heart.”The widower was delighted.

"It's him again. Save us oh God." utters the bartender.  "Which God are you calling to," asks the philosopher, "have you not heard that he is dead?"  "No..."  "OH YES! And, most extraordinarily, WE have killed him." Shouts the philosopher.  "What do you mean? Like, you and me, and the bartender over there?" another customer next to him asks.  "No, no. Us - the human race." replies the philosopher.  "Ah. But how could we..."  "Drink up the sea?"  "No, I-"  "Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon? What were we doing when we unchained this earth from its sun? Whither is it moving now? Whither are we moving? Away from all suns? Are we not plunging continually? Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there still any up or down? Are we not straying, as through an infinite nothing? Do we not feel the breath of empty space? Has it not become colder? Is not night continually closing in on us? Do we not need to light lanterns in the morning? Do we hear nothing as yet of the noise of the gravediggers who are burying God? Do we smell nothing as yet of the divine decomposition? Gods, too, decompose. God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him.”"Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?" the philosopher finishes. "Did you like it?" he asks the bartender.  The bartender, half-asleep, replies, "Yes, yes. Very interesting. Now, what was your name again?"  "Friedrich Nietzs-"  "Friedrich, look. My boss is going to come back in a few minutes and if he sees you still here without a drink on the table he's going to get mad at me. So I'm going to ask you one more time, either order something or get out of this bar!"  "Fine, I'll have a glass of milk."  "What?!"  "I'll have an ellipsis" says another customer."A what?""An "ellipsis", a narrative device used to condense time in a story.""Ah, okay."A couple of hours later:"Man, can you believe this guy? He was asking for milk, in a goddamn bar, Jeff" the bartender tells his friend.  "Who was he?" Jeff asks.  "Friedrich...something. Nitch might've been."the bartender replies  "Has the name of an oddball for sure."   "He was rambling something about God being dead and stuff."  "Was he one of them Jehova's witnesses?"  "No, I think he might've been one of my many hallucinations.""What are you on about?""I think my whole life is a dream Jeff. I don't know how to explain it""Well try, goddamnit."The bartender moves suddenly and strongly grabs Jeff's neck as he kisses him thoroughly and with extreme passion. "I am madly in love with you, Jeff. I have been ever since you stepped into this bar the very first time.""Wow, do you really mean it?""No! This is not me, you see. I am being controlled!""I really...thought you loved me.""Well, I do, platonically of course.""What's that?""Something to do with Plato, I think.""Who's he?""The guy who was here the day before. Kind of like Nitch."And that was the tale of the closeted homosexual Bartender as he listened to Nietzsche recite passages from “The Gay Science”(pun intended), and as he dealt with the problem of free will in a world constructed by the writings of a mentally deranged redditor. <|endoftext|>

Jerry Seinfeld yells.The East European terrorist smirks and replies: "To fack your mader, that heppened to be working her usual side of the road thet night."Jerry further loses his temper and lands a few punches at the terrorist's face. The terrorist stares blankly at Jerry and says: "Did a little kitten just kiss me? The fack was thet?"Jerry tries again: "I'm asking the questions here! Why did the rooster cross the road!?"The terrorist answers: "To gather his rooster comrades so they could take your mader to motel and hef intercourse. It was a 3 for 2 Saturday special discount, how could they decline such an affer?"Jerry punches the terrorist in the cheek repeatedly, to which the terrorist then remarks:"You hit like little taddler with cerebral parese, put more weight into your right foot and maybe you hit more like 8th grader next time.""Shut up! Why did the rooster cross the road!?" Jerry asks again, this time forming a tear in his eye. Jerry punches the terrorist a couple more times afterwards until he has seemingly had enough.The terrorist says, now raising his voice: "Oof! Okay, okay. Stap! I'll cooperate...to arrive at the drop-off point and retrieve the peckege."Jerry widens his eyes in anticipation now that he has finally managed to break down the terrorist. He eagerly turns around and yells towards a locked door behind him: "This guy is about to talk! Get in here, sir!"He redirects his attention at the terrorist as another man that's wearing a suit unlocks the door and walks into the interrogation room. Jerry continues: "Yeah? Well, go on! What was inside the package?! Where was the drop-off point?! Where is the package now?!"The terrorist asks: "Can I hef pen and paper? I will draw mep of location of peckege. I don't know whet is inside. I just follow directions, no questions asked. The rooster knows."The suited man, who acts as Jerry's handler gives a subtle nod to Jerry. Jerry produces a pen and a notebook from the breast pocket of his shirt. They uncuff the terrorist and allow him to draw a map.Jerry shows the map to his handler to which the handler says:"Excellent! Good job, kid! Go outside and wait for the chopper. I'm calling it in now. A tactical team will be joining you." Jerry rushes outside the CIA's headquarters in Langley. He is eventually picked up by a helicopter that is occupied by a heavily armed tactical unit.They fly for almost two hours and land near their destination. The tactical team disembark the helicopter alongside Jerry and they close in on a motel that was marked on the hand drawn map. The map also depicts the room number of their target. Upon arriving they discreetly evacuate the motel's lobby, quickly retrieve information about the targeted room and its occupants and stack up at the room's door.This is it. The case Jerry has been working on for months is starting to near a conclusion, or so Jerry thinks as the team breach the door and throw a stinger grenade into the room. As they enter, their field of vision is obscured by feathers slowly descending to the floor. They see several dead roosters, severed beaks, limbs, blood splatter and Jerry Seinfeld's disheveled mother lying on the bed. She is covered in a blanket and has a confused expression on her face.All the roosters have died from the stinger grenade's detonation, except one of them. The surviving rooster emerges from underneath Jerry's mother's blanket and stares angrily at Jerry. It abruptly tries to exit the room by running in-between the men's feet in order to reach the doorway but is pushed back by the light thrust of a team member's foot. The rooster then exclaims:"God fucking damnit, you guys are such cockblocks!" <|endoftext|>

The bar is a bar for rusty old knights - a tavern if you will - which means that the bartender is a rusty old knight, the bar-wenches are rusty old knights, the porters, grooms and stewards are rusty old knights. Even the rusty old accountant is a rusty old knight.The rusty old knight says to the rusty old knight:"Good sir, my only quest is to drink a flagon of ale in a tavern staffed exclusively by rusty old knights. It is my rusty old purpose. The only thing that keeps me going."The rusty old knight says to the rusty old knight:"Good sir, *my* only quest is to keep this rusty old knight from ever drinking a single flagon of ale in any tavern staffed exclusively by rusty old knights, in order to sustain this rusty old knight's fragile sense of purpose. This in turn is *my* rusty old purpose, the only thing that keeps me going, and the reason I keep him always by my side."The rusty old knight says to the rusty old knight:"Good sir, **my** only quest is to furnish a flagon of ale to a rusty old knight whose only quest is to drink a flagon of ale in a tavern staffed exclusively by rusty old knights, in order to *drain* him of his sense of purpose, because the purposeless husk of a knight is exactly the right size and weight to keep barrels from rolling away. This, is **my** rusty old purpose, and the only reason for which I own and manage a tavern for rusty old knights, staffed exclusively by rusty old knights."And so, the three knights fall into a co-dependent relationship: the rusty old knight vies to furnish the rusty old knight with a flagon of ale. The rusty old knight vies to receive a flagon of ale from the rusty old knight. And the rusty old knight vies to keep the rusty old knight from receiving a flagon of ale from the rusty old knight, and to keep the rusty old knight from furnishing the rusty old knight with a flagon of ale. In this way the trio becomes a three-way nexus - a self-sustaining cycle of deferred resolution in which each member is continuously on the point of, but never reaches fulfilment.Over time this abstract relationship begins to take on a concrete from of its own, eventually manifesting as a rusty old triangle, which the narrator carefully peels out of the joke, and sews into the flag of Guyana."I don't understand," says Adelia Smith, third wife of professional vexillologist Whitney Smith, designer of the flag of Guyana "why did you go to all the trouble of weaving a narrative about three rusty old knights, each dependent on the others if all you wanted was another triangle for your flag? And more to the point, why did you include the clown in the premise when you didn't refer to him once in the rest of the joke?""I'm a professional vexillologist," says professional vexillologist Whitney Smith, "and if you think you can tell *me* a better way of getting triangles, I'd like to hear it." <|endoftext|>

Conor is dragged out of the bar by his entourage as he hisses and flails his arms around.Another man enters the bar minutes later and sits next to the elderly man. The man examines the slight bump on the side of the old man's head, then asks him: "Ah, Conor was in 'ere again, wasn't he?" Before the old man manages to reply, a swarm of leprechauns storm into the bar wielding icepicks. One of the leprechauns yell in a squeaky and faint voice: "Which onna ye mumblen old dronks just insulted the master!?" None of the patrons react as they don't hear or notice them."What fooking gall! I just asked a question! Which onna ye were talken shite?!" The leprechaun exclaims yet again.

Get him lads!" The leprechaun yells before they charge the old man and hit his legs with their ice picks." The old man doesn't notice anything as they exhaust themselves. They eventually stop and one of them says: "There! Now you'll know better than getting cheeky with the master again! Let's feck off, lads! He's learned his lesson!"Before the last leprechaun exits an intoxicated man notices it, springs out of his seat and yells gleefully: "Conooor! Where ye goen?! I'm so glad t'see ye back!

Colin was bragging to his friend, Laura, one day, “You know, I know everyone there is to know. Just name someone, anyone, and I know them.”Tired of his boasting, Laura called his bluff, “OK, Colin how about Tom Cruise?” “Sure, yes, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it.”So Colin and Laura fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise’s door and sure enough, Tom Cruise shouts, “Colin! Great to see you! You and your friend come right in and join me for lunch!”Although impressed, Colin’s friend is still sceptical. After they leave Cruise’s house, she tells Colin that she thinks Colin’s knowing Cruise was just lucky. “No, no, just name anyone else,” Colin says. “President Bush,” his friend quickly retorts. “Yes,” Colin says, “I know him, let’s fly out to Washington.” And off they go. At the White House, Dubya spots Colin on the tour and motions him and his friend over, saying, “Colin, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let’s have a cup of coffee first and catch up.”Well, Laura is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds she expresses her doubts to Colin, who again implores her to name anyone else. “The Pope,” she replies. “Sure!” says Colin. “My wife is from Italy and because of her I’ve known the Pope a long time.” So off they fly to Rome.Colin and Laura are assembled with the masses in Vatican Square when Colin says, “This will never work. I can’t catch the Pope’s eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I’ll come out on the balcony with the Pope.” And he disappears into the crowd headed toward the Vatican.Sure enough, half an hour later Colin emerges with the Pope on the balcony but by the time Colin returns, he finds that his friend has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics. Working his way to his friends side, Colin asks her, “What happened?” His friend looks up and says, “I was doing fine until you and the Pope came out on the balcony and the man next to me said, “Who’s that on the balcony with Colin?”(Any resemblance to Colin Firth in this joke is entirely coincidental – honest! :) ) <|endoftext|>

Then the CEO asks Dave, "Give me one solid reason why I should hire you." to which Dave replies, "I literally know everybody." The CEO looking confused says, "What do you mean literally everybody?" Dave explains to the CEO that he literally knows everybody and encourages the CEO to name any one person and he promises he knows them."I bet you dont know Tom Cruise", says the CEO"Tom!? Oh hell yeah! We took a few acting classes together back in college, great guy.""Bullshit!" the CEO replies, "Im getting us flight right know and we are going to go visit him."So Dave and the CEO get on a plane and head out west to find Tom Cruise's home. After some searching they find it and go to knock on the door. To the CEO's surprise Tom answers the door and the first thing out of his mouth is, "DAVE! Oh man, I havent seen you in ages, come on in and share a drink with me!" After a few hours of shooting the shit and pounding some brews the CEO and Dave decide its time to leave. On the way to the airport the CEO tells Dave, "Ok, so im still not convinced, I mean, small world right? You couldnt possibly know Tom Cruise AND the president!" Dave smirks and says, "Would you like to go find out?"The CEO immediately buys plane tickets to go to D.C. to see if Dave is full of shit or not. The two manage to get on a tour of the White House when out of no where the CEO hears somebody yelling, "Dave! Hey! Dave! So good to see you! Ive got a lot of meetings today but lets get a cup of coffee real quick!" The CEO turns around to find that the president is the one yelling at Dave. Stunned and almost convinced that Dave literally knows everybody, the CEO says, "Ok, mister, Tom Cruise and the president, thats impressive, but I highly doubt you know the Pope!" Dave then recalls stories of his parents growing up in a small town with the Pope. The CEO ready to finally call Dave out fronts the bill for tickets to the Vatican to try and meet the Pope. As they stand in the crowd of thousands and thousands of people waiting to be blessed by the Pope, Dave tells the CEO, "Im going to try to get us a better view." Dave makes his way past a few guards and up some stairs and the next thing you know he's walking out next to the Pope.Dave returns to find the CEO is having a heart attack.
