"Why can't the mosquito climb a wall? Said the prosecutor. ""Why can't YOU climb a wall?"" Said the defense attorney. ""My guy over here will NOT be harassed by such statements like that."" The mosquito was indeed offended that a gentleman like the prosecutor could stoop that low. The prosecutor indeed stooped that low. His saggy balls, saggy balls of a gentleman, the saggy balls smothered the floor. Ungentlemanlike. ""He's flexing, judge! Don't let him flex like that!"" shouted the Defense Attorney. ""Objection!"" said the plaintiff. ""Gentlemen can do whatever they want!"" The mosquito clapped back. ""But a mosquito can't climb a wall? I'll fucking suck the blood out of your bald dome you eggman.""The judge bribed in favor of the bald plaintiff was unexpectedly astounded by the sexual prowess displayed by the mosquito . This was real love in first sight. This was indeed real love in first sight, the prosecutor also saw the sexual prowess of the mosquito. We got a love triangle here folks! ""umm excuse me? Prosecutor? Isn't that a slur to bald people?"" asked the ugly plaintiff. ""Haha suck a dick you miserable cueball. Oh wait, you don't even have teeth!"" giggled the Prosecutor. ""But the mosquito also doesn't have teeth. "" Said the Defense Attorney who was now acting like a Devil's Advocate. ""Are you acting like the Devil's Advocate? Trick question, you can't because you ARE the Devil."" said the mosquito while getting its proboscis licked by the judge. ""Am I the Devil?"" this was a question that haunted the Devil throughout the whole proceeding. ""Why don't you defend me devil, I'll shave my bush for you"" parlayed the plaintiff, losing both his prosecutor and his teeth. ""Ok. "" acquiesced the Devil. ""Hey guys, don't leave me out of the fun!"" asked the prosecutor readying for the threesome. ""Quick, Call me Judge Judy, cause it helps me cum more than once"" exclaimed the mosquito while reaching the rare power climax. ""I‚ÄîI just cant. The prosecutor just weirds me out. I do want to call you judge judy, in fact I can say judge judy 10 times, but the prosecutor looks like the walrus."" puked the judge. ""Oh you choosy bitch. You choosy bitch of a clit. Your imaginary clit smothered the floor. Look what you've done."" gentlemaned the prosecutor. ""Why don't we get the bailiff and start a threesome of our own?"" argued the bald sentient sexdoll. ""Semolina"" Pilchared the Devil. ""As long as I get to know how many vaginas the Devil has."" inquired the Bailiff. ""Six, it's in Dante's Inferno. Dipshit."" said the Devil. Edgar Allan Poe. ""WOW, the foul language out of you, gorgeous."" pranced the mosquito from the other pews. ""Suck me more you fucking hairless smegma. I revel on being able to pick up your face like it's a basketball."" whispered gleefully the bailiff. ""Why don't you try me, woman?"" Crabalocker? More like Grab a cocker! ""The Hairless Smegma."" dripping from a dead dog's eye. Edgar Allan Poe: ""ü§£I'm Cryinü§£"""	1.0
How do I get you on top of me? Well first, we meet, either at some place we frequent often, bumping into each other multiple times before awkwardly acknowledging each other exists, or maybe its a High School crush we somehow had a memory with on Facebook that we both commented on, and we start talking, and I'm into you, you stayed fit, you're into me, i became a lawyer. We message each other slowly, you trying your bits of humor that have made women laugh in the past, and it works, cause ive never heard them before and they're alright I guess. I chuckle, and the more wine I drink the more I laugh. 'You should be a commedian!' I say, even drunk I only say it half heartedly. The next thirty minutes are spent you telling me how youve always thought about doing it, just really going for it, but You just werent sure if you could get on the stage, and if your bits were good enough. They're not. I laugh in all the right places though and encourage you, 'Of course they are, I laughed, right?' and hope you dont remember you said that the next day, but you do and every time I shut down a little more and more until you hopefully get it. Each consecutive day though we message more and its not the worst, we slowly have this thing where if I dont get a message I start wondering if i said something wrong, and you do the same, but really we're both just in the middle of something. Odd though it happens right when I say something kind of out there. But then you finally ask me out to dinner, we have a nice time at some Italian place I'll forget tomorrow, the waiter keeps refilling the wine because we both Ubered there, and suddenly the food is gone and youre asking if I want to stay at your place and I do, i havent gotten laid in fucking forever, and before you know it, I'm on top of you.  The end.	1.0

Dancing? A Muslim couple in Prestatyn, preparing for their wedding, meet the Mullah for counselling.The Mullah asks if they have any last questions before they leave.The man asks, ‚ÄúWe realise it‚Äôs a tradition in Islam for men to dance with men, and women to dance with women.But, at our wedding reception, we‚Äôd like your permission to dance together.‚Äù‚ÄúAbsolutely not,‚Äù says the Mullah. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs immoral. Men and women always dance separately.‚Äù‚ÄúSo after the ceremony I can‚Äôt even dance with my own wife?‚Äù‚ÄúNo,‚Äù answered the Mullah, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs forbidden in Islam.‚Äù‚ÄúWell, okay,‚Äù says the man, ‚ÄúWhat about sex? Can we finally have sex?2‚ÄúOf course!‚Äù replies the Mullah, ‚ÄúSex is OK within marriage, to have children!‚Äù‚ÄúWhat about different positions?‚Äù asks the man.‚ÄúNo problem,‚Äù says the Mullah.‚ÄúWoman on top?‚Äù the man asks.‚ÄúSure,‚Äù says the Mullah. ‚ÄúGo for it!‚Äù‚ÄúDoggy style?‚Äù‚ÄúSure!‚Äù‚ÄúOn the kitchen table?‚Äù‚ÄúYes, yes!‚Äù‚ÄúCan we do it with all my four wives together on rubber sheets with a bottle of hot oil, a couple of vibrators, leather harnesses, a bucket of honey and a porno video?‚Äù‚ÄúYou may indeed!‚Äù‚ÄúCan we do it standing up?‚Äù‚ÄúNo.‚Äù says the Mullah.‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù asks the man.‚ÄúIt could lead to dancing.‚Äùnote :In a lot of religions men can only dance with men, and not with women, not even their wives.....

"Or What? A man comes to his doctor and tells him that his wife hasn't had sex with him for 6 months. The doctor tells the man to bring his wife in so he can talk to her. So the wife comes into the doctors office and the doc asks her what's wrong, and why doesn't she want to have sex with her husband anymore. The wife tells him, ""For the past 6 months, every morning I take a cab to work. I don't have any money so the cab driver asks me, 'So are you going to pay today or what?' so I take a 'or what'. When I get to work I'm late so the boss asks me, 'So are we going to write this down in the book or what?' so I take a 'or what'. Back home again I take the cab and again I don't have any money so the cab driver asks me again, 'So are you going to pay this time or what?' so again I take a 'or what'. So you see doc when I get home I'm all tired out, and I don't want it any more.""

What heroes need a nerf for the next patch? In short, I feel thatLeshrac absolutely needs a nerf, lightning shorter cast range, his ult lower damage output at higher levels, lower the scale a little? Stun and edict are okay, I think.Gyro is simply in a good spot, I don't consider him over powered, just one of the best or the best for his position. To even it out a bit I think changing flak cannon to slow down his immense farming speed would make sense, and maybe raise cd on his ultimate so he can't literally farm all day then make every fight- it seems he gets best of both worlds right now in this meta.Bounty is a hero I did not think was too strong but he apparently is the go-to for any type of team that needs a midgame snowball. Lower track gold bonus, then? Although I hate the hero personally I think he's in an ok spot, not too strong.Bloodseeker, q damage should be lowered, i think the potential is too high and to simply dive a t3 and find a kill at 4 minutes in the game is absurd. This, of course is also to blame from his thirst ability, I think the numbers should be lowered a bit there as well. I'm on moble and too lazy to lookSF agi I think could be nerfed to not let him scale so well into the late game. I think that is partly why he is picked so much, he is good early with some help then is great all game, generally speaking.Qop is suddenly strong, I at one point thought that if a hero stuns her mid-cast of her blink ability it would not reset the cooldown and she would not blink at all. Just a concept that wouldnt throw her out and make the blink a little bit closer to the actual item. Because her animation is so long this would be possible. For antimage this could be possible too, to treat his popularity in ti5 but I don't think he's too strong at all and his blink cast is far less predictable and would be harder to stop.Dazzle is okay. WW is okay, the fact that her ult goes through bkb is strong but removing that would be too heavy of a nerf. Buffs? Personally, (well, these are the heroes I want to play personally but I think are too weak right now) terrorblade, alchemist.Naga support in my opinion is simply a phase and it does not need a nerf, if anything net time reduced. And maybe base intel.Any hero I missed?Discuss if you please. In advance sorry for typos or mistakes, on mobile	1.0

"A portly man saunters into the Allport Taphouse He calls out to the barkeep and orders their darkest porter. As the barkeep pours his drink, she takes notice of him looking puzzled at the interior. Everything was rather ornate, too ornate for the small town of Riverport where the man lived. Portraits covered the walls depicting a vast variety of people of many time periods. The other patrons seemed equally as varied.""First time at Allport?"" the barkeep inquired with a slight grin as she handed him his glass.""Yup, strange place. You just opened up right?""""In your town, yes. We're known all over the world though. I'll give you the rundown of this place"" she lowered her voice to a whisper with her grin getting even wider. ""This is gonna sound pretty weir‚Äî""Just then the entire room shook as a tentacle burst through the front door sending splinters at alarming speeds across the room. In a flash the barkeep pulled a lever behind the bar lowering a portcullis stabbing through the tentacle, severing the limb. Several bright flashes followed by a hum of typewriters came from the opposite side of the room as all of this was happening. The man just stood there with his mouth agape not believing what he was seeing.""What the fuck is happening here?"" he finally said after a long drink from his glass.""Well, I was about to explain everything before something like this happened‚Äîtends to be a little easier on newcomers. We are no longer in Riverport. This Taphouse transports itself from port to port. Sometimes it travels as a ship"" she gestures at several portholes around the room through which he could see the crashing waves.""Other times it simply teleports to the next port. It's not really up to us, the Allport kinda has a mind of its own. Next stop is a port in Portugal"" she continued ""and if you wish to go back to where you came from at anytime simply enter the door at the end of the hall there and step through the portal. I think that covers everything. Have any questions?""""What about those people over there"" the man gestures to the several patrons typing away.""Reporters"" she said with a sly grin.""I see...""""How's your porter?""""Porter? I hardly know her"" he said with a light chuckle.""Damn right you don't! You didn't even ask my name before taking a swig!"" bubbled the porter with violently ferocity. ""Barkeep, I'd like to file a report on this portly man of little importance""The moment the porter's last statement left her bubbles, a strobe of bright flashes erupted from the other side of the room."	1.0

A quantum physicist walks into a bar ‚ÄúI have arrived!‚Äù exclaims the physicist as he moves quickly towards the counter, eager for his first whiskey.‚ÄúI‚Äôm not so sure‚Äù, says the bartender. ‚ÄúYour current momentum scatters my knowledge of your location.‚Äù‚ÄúBut at our macroscopic scale, quantum effects don‚Äôt apply here‚Äù, says the physicist, still twitching for his anticipation of a drink. Or perhaps it was the amphetamines. ‚ÄúYou still have to admit that you yourself are a wavefunction!‚Äù says the bartender, then raises his arm to point out a sign in the window that reads ‚ÄúQUANTUM EFFECTS APPLY HERE‚Äù.‚ÄúWell I never said I was a good physicist...‚Äù said the okay physicist. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I‚Äôve come actually. You see, I‚Äôm very much in need of employment. I‚Äôm willing to do whatever it takes.‚Äù‚ÄúIt just so happens that there is an open position available. Can you fill it?‚Äù questions the bartender.While skipping a beat, the physicist calms down and walks behind the counter to reach a narrow door in the corner of the bar. He opens the door and rolls out a dusty vacuum, finds an open outlet nearby, plugs it in, and begins cleaning up the floor of the establishment.‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think that‚Äôs a bit loud for this time of morning?‚Äù the bartender asked with a loud voice and a concerned look on his face. ‚ÄúIt might frighten the patrons.‚ÄùUnaware that the bartender had said anything because he had his noise cancelling headphones on while working, the janitor continued to vacuum, until he began noticing a rumbling in the floors and stools and tequila bottles of the bar slowly building in strength by the second. With a giant fervor, a wooden exterior wall bursts apart, revealing the cause of the rumble: a stampede of elephants, wildebeests, sharks, and rhinos. The custodian quickly leapt backwards, avoiding the deadly stampede narrowly. It wasn‚Äôt until the dust settled that he noticed that his duties would be no more - the vacuum was crushed into hundreds and hundreds of minute pieces. Reluctantly realizing his fate, it was then that the workman began to collapse as his corporeal form slowly faded away.‚ÄúI‚Äôve no time for this!‚Äù exclaimed the bartender, as he vigorously scrubs down the counter, now with shatters of glass spread about. But he did have time. His temporal existence in that bar had seemingly always existed and was not about to end.	1.0
"An alcoholic walks into a bar. He hobbles over to the counter and stares at the bartender, a tear welling in his left eye. ""Listen, sir. I know you are a good man. You love your wife dearly, you walk your children to school every day, and you pay your taxes.""""Uh‚Ä¶""""That is why I ask of you, good man, to never, ever serve me again. I am battling alcoholism, and it is no easy fight. If you refuse to serve me every single time I come here, I promise to reward you with one hundred dollars at the end of the week. Deal?""The bartender scratches his head, but being a keen businessman and knowing a good investment when he sees one, he accepts the offer. ""Deal.""""Thanks, man."" The alcoholic exits the bar, satisfied.The next day, the alcoholic walks into that same bar. He heads up to the counter and asks for a shot of whiskey.""Sorry, lad,"" the bartender replies. ""I promised not to serve you.""The alcoholic chuckles. ""What? Whom the hell d'you promise that to?""""Er, to you, sir.""""That's horseradish! Look, I don't know how much money you're being offered to deny me this, but I can pay you double that amount.""The bartender, again, being a wise businessman, raises an eyebrow. ""That would be two hundred dollars at the end of the week.""""Two hundred it is!"" The alcoholic slams his fist on the counter for the sake of little besides being dramatic. ""Now pass me a scotch, will ya?""An hour of drinking later, the alcoholic staggers out the door into the cold of the night, and the bartender grins at his business well made.The following day, the alcoholic hurries through the door of the bar, wearing a mortified expression and some dusty clothes. ""What have you done?! I told you not to serve me!""""I'm sorry, sir. You offered a higher amount yesterday, and I simply couldn't help myself.""""Oh god, oh my god, oh Jesus‚Ä¶ You don't understand, I woke up inside a trash can in an alley just an hour or so ago‚ÄîI don't remember anything. No one's returning any of my calls. I'm afraid I did something terrible yesterday. You've got to stop me, please, I implore!""The bartender twirls his mustache. ""Well, if you were to pay me more than you promised to yesterday, which was two hundred‚Ä¶""""I'll pay you four hundred, then! Just don't let me get anywhere near a drink again!""""Alright, bud.""The alcoholic leaves the bar again, and the bartender smiles in approval.On the evening of the proceeding day, the alcoholic bursts into the bar, insanity flashing across his glassy eyes. He looks the bartender dead in the eye and nearly screams, ""Whiskey!""The bartender shakes his head grimly. ""I'm sorry, sir, I can't do that‚Äî""""Eight hundred!"" the alcoholic smashes his fist into the counter again. ""Just give me a fucking whiskey, ya cunt!""""Aight man, it's your funeral,"" says the bartender, pouring a glass of fine whiskey.With sunlight flooding the establishment, the alcoholic again walks through the door, looking even more disheveled. ""Sweet mother of Christ, what did I tell you?!""""I apologize candidly, sir. You keep doubling your promise each time, and I'm incapable of feeling any remorse; I'm in this purely for monetary gain, you see.""""Well then, just so you know, whenever that version of me walks in here offering to up the ante, he's lying. Don't trust him.""""Right. But, uh, I'm only gonna do that if you double the price again.""""Urgh, fine. Whatever. Sixteen hundred, is it?""""Indeed. Nice doing business with you.""The alcoholic walks outside again, seeming a little more cheered up.By eventide of the morrow, as expected, the alcoholic bursts through the wall of the bar, sending dust and debris to every corner of the room. He leaps to the counter and screeches, ""WHERE'S ME FUCKING USQUE YE DOBBER?!""The bartender sighs. ""Nope. Can't.""""GIVE IT TO ME! NOW!""""I've been told not to trust you.""""THIRTY-TWO HUNDRED QUID! SIXTY-FOUR! ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT! TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY-SIX! FIVE HUNDRED AND TWELVE!""""We don't‚Ä¶ I don't take quids, mate. And again, I'm not going to serve you. You can't bribe me.""""Then I have no other choice."" The crazed alcoholic pulls out a revolver and, with a swift motion, sets it against the bartender's temple. The bartender begins sweating nervously. ""This is all very simple, Mr. Pollington,"" says the lunatic. ""You serve me a whiskey, I walk out of here without leaving a trace. You refuse, and‚Ä¶ well, someone'll have to clean up that mess."" He pushes the revolver deeper into the flesh, and the bartender restrains a gasp between his labored breaths. ""Now, I don't know which one you personally wish to pick, Mr. Pollington, but I know that your wife will be very happy to hear you didn't choose the latter. Either way, I'd suggest making your move right about now.""The bartender sends a shaking hand towards a glass, fills it to the brim with strong, harsh whiskey, and places it on the counter.""Ah,"" the alcoholic says, retrieving the gun to his pocket. ""Wise choice, Mr. Pollington. Very wise indeed."" He gulps down the drink and throws it onto the floor, where it shatters into a thousand shards. ""Another.""The bartender, visibly shaken, pours him another glass and sets it on the counter. The alcoholic once again quaffs it in a blink of the eye, then smashes it into the floor. ""Another!""He suppresses a whimper as he pours the maniac a third whiskey, which he again downs instantly and smashes into the floor. ""Another one, Mr. Pollington!""Ten or twelve shots later, the floor is nearly covered in broken glass. The bartender is whimpering, and the alcoholic is laughing maniacally, smashing the glasses and watching the bartender dance behind the counter like a circus monkey, ferreting about for whiskey bottles.""I‚Ä¶ oh my god, I‚Ä¶ I've run out, sir. I've no more whiskey left,"" the bartender whimpers after a few more rounds.""Hmm,"" the alcoholic mutters, now much more wobbly than before. ""Very well then. You've been a‚Ä¶ good, er‚Ä¶ yeah."" He turns around and stumbles across the bar. ""I'll be sure to‚Ä¶ come arou‚Äî"" The alcoholic retches, then throws up on the glass-covered floor. He wipes the vomit from his lips and heads on into the dark streets of the night.The bartender, fatigued and terrified, steps to the side then collapses.When he wakes up, the bar is still empty, the night is still dark and the floor is still covered in dust, vomit and broken glass. The bartender gets on his quivering feet with a grunt and checks the time. It's 4:37 AM. He scrambles to the telephone on the wall and dials frantically.""911, what is your emergency?""""I‚Ä¶ There was a man here, a few hours ago. He threatened me with a gun, and, and‚Ä¶""""*No.*""""P-pardon?""""*Let's try again.*""&nbsp;An alcoholic walks into a bar. He hobbles over to the counter and stares at the bartender, a tear welling in his left eye. ""Sir, you must help me. I'm in a terrible condition‚Äîalcohol is ruining my life in every way imaginable. You know your spirits, good man; surely you know the solution to all this!""The bartender's eyes brighten, and a smile curls his wrinkled face. He crouches behind the counter and pulls out a tiny cubic capsule, no more than a millimeter in radius. ""One cubic micrometer,"" he says, shaking the capsule. ""A trillionth of a milliliter; around four-fifths of a picogram of pure, distilled, unadulterated antialcohol."" He pours a small glass of whiskey and places it on the counter. ""When in contact with a similar amount of alcohol‚Ä¶"" He drops the capsule into the liquid, which after a few moments acquires a soft white glow. ""‚Ä¶the two should annihilate and emit about‚Ä¶ 34 calories worth of radiant energy.""The alcoholic eyes him, confused.""E=mc¬≤.""""Oh. I see.""The bartender pulls out a bowl filled with these capsules. ""All you have to do is swallow these pills every so often and your alcoholism should gradually evaporate, like, uh, fine wine.""The alcoholic grabs the bowl and places it in his pocket. ""Thank you so much! I-I don't know how I could ever repay‚Äî""""A hundred dollars.""""Ah, yes, that should do."" He slides a one hundred dollar bill across the counter and leaves the bar, satisfied.The next day, the alcoholic returns to the bar, looking distressed. The bartender raises an eyebrow. ""Well?""""Hmm?""""Did they work?""""Oh, yes. Wonderfully. I no longer crave alcohol, not even the slightest. The antialcohol did its job immaculately, but, er‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶"" He pulls up his shirt, revealing a bright light shining through his stomach. ""I just can't get enough of 'em. I'm afraid my addiction has simply transformed into antialcoholism. I understand you've some solution to this plight as well?""""Well, surely!"" The bartender pulls out a glass filled with a transparent, viscuous liquid. ""One pint,"" he says, shaking the glass. ""An eighth of a gallon; around four-elevenths of a kilogram of pure, distilled, unadulterated antiantialcohol."" He grabs another glass, one filled with capsules of antialcohol, and places it on the counter. ""When in contact with a similar amount of antialcohol‚Ä¶"" He pours the antiantialcohol into the second glass, which very quickly shines a brilliant white glow that only grows brighter and brighter with time. ""‚Ä¶the two should annihilate and emit about‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ what is it‚Ä¶ three megatons of TNT?""""Three‚Ä¶ *three megatons of TNT?!*""The light emanating from the glass turns blinding, and a hot aura manifests around it.""No, no, sorry‚Äî*six* megatons of TNT. 'Cause you're counting both the antialcohol and the antiantialcohol.""The glass shatters, and the liquid inside seethes and levitates into the air.""Are you‚Ä¶ are you being serious?!""""Quite so. I have just placed both of us in immediate mortal danger, which we have little to no chance of eluding. I'm inclined to offer an apology, but as I said before, I am incapable of feeling any remorse.""The counter is engulfed in flames, and a red hue paints the corners of the room.""What? When did you say that?""""Oh, you're not the same guy? Sorry, let me explain:""And so, during the next two seconds, the bartender hastily tells:""An alcoholic walks into a bar. He hobbles over to the counter and stares at the bartender, a tear welling in his left eye. 'Listen, sir. I know you are a good man. You love your wife dearly, you walk your children to school every day, and you pay your taxes.' 'Uh‚Ä¶' 'That is why I ask of you‚Ä¶'""But near the end, he notices that there's a recursion in the story. If he is to formally and rigorously explain the entire situation, he would need to repeat it infinitely many times! *But wait*, he thinks‚Äî*if I used a supertask, such that after each recursion I tell the story twice as quickly as I did the previous recursion, it would only take me another two seconds to tell the entire thing!* And so, using this oddly familiar strategy, he recounts the entire anti-anti-joke, recursions and all, in a mere 4 seconds.""Oh,"" exclaims the antialcoholic. ""I get it now! Thank you, Mr.‚Äî""And then the comedic duo went# E V E R Y W H E R E"	1.0
