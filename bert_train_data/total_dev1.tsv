"Why did the chicken cross the road. So, you remember the time when Gabriel Iglesias went to KFC.  Yeah, their electricity went out, and it was winter, which was a bad season for power outages.  Anyway, so the power went out, and the frozen chickens, they came back to life.  So you had butchers in the kitchen cutting off a bunch of chicken heads, see, and one of them got away, and Gabriel Iglesias, who was at the counter, noticed one of the chickens got away, so he turns to the clerk, points to the escaping chicken, and says ""I want that one.""  Long story short, the chicken crossed the road because the dinosaurs escaped."	1.0

Well, there was once a shapeshifting policeman - now, don't get me wrong, I'm not referring to any member of royalty here, so let's clear that up right now - anyway, there was once a shapeshifting policeman who kept putting on all sorts of disguises.One day - now, don't look too much into this phrase, it is of no matter which particular day it was, just a cool summer's day in July of some year - anyway, one day, the shapeshifting police disguises himself as a gang member, a member of some Chinese gang or so.As he was making his way to a meet - now, let's not be derailed here by the particulars, for it is of no matter here whether he was on foot or in an automobile or whatever, just that he was on his way to a meet - anyway, he was making his way to a meet when he found himself in the middle of what appeared to be some sort of sting operation of some kind.Federal agents swarmed the area, with their signature blue jackets emblazoned with the letters ""FBI"" on their backs; large black SUVs were scattered across the street and two choppers buzzed overhead, their rotors creating a deafening roar.The shapeshifting policeman began to panic - now, don't get me wrong, he was visibly panicking, but it is of no particular matter here whether it was a light sort of panic or a serious, gut-wrenching sort of panic, just that he was panicking - anyway, the shapeshifting policeman began to panic.Why was he panicking, you ask. Well, because he was a shapeshifting policeman and nobody - yes, literally nobody - knew he was a shapeshifting policeman.Well, okay - nobody, except for the other 229,783 shapeshifting reptiloids who also gallivanted across Earth routinely shapeshifting and meeting up in secret underground caverns at night."	1.0

"A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night."" The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound—a kind of soft hum, barely there, hovering at the edge of his aural horizon. After some time, he decides to investigate.Wandering the halls, the man wonders to himself, why did the monks so readily accept his presence. Is it mere monksmanship, or perhaps have they some deeper factor to conceal. Who is this man, anyway.The hum grows closer as he nears the exit, and a vague celeste gleam lies upon the tiles. There, beyond the archway, a being of sorts stands and smiles at his approach. He smiles back.""Come along with me,"" the being whispers. The man awaits further elaboration, but that appears to be the spirit's only request.It turns to ramble the marble path set along the steep outline of the monastery. A peculiar yet warm feeling, almost like levitating over a summery shore, cocoons the man, and prods him forward in pursuit of the visitant. As he makes his way past the boulders, this feeling grows somewhat heavier, so that once he crosses the last stepping stone, there is no doubt in his mind that his feet cannot feel the ground.Across the road is a vast forest, trees numerous like stars in the night. The spirit wanders yonder, and the man feels as if he's no choice but to wander along. His feet do not take him; surely, the breeze carries him forth. And as he ambles into the woods in wonderment, his consciousness diffuses among the waves—a state between living and dreaming—and he feels that he and the spirit are the only realities in the universe, and the trees and the stones and the monastery form the canvas upon which their figures are painted.The being pauses over a raised glade, and turns to face the man. It smiles. He smiles back, perhaps instinctively. The feeling of floating turns surreal, and the languor grows ever so fervent, rising, flying, approaching the infinite. The spirit wanders nearer. It all closes in. This is it. This is it. This is—""Good morning.""He opens his eyes. Streaks of sunlight wander through the monastery window, falling on the monk who stirred him awake. The man glances about as the feeling rapidly falls away.""What… what…""""We fixed your car,"" the monk continues. ""I trust you should be on your way soon, but if you'd like breakfast, it's in the main hall.""He leaves before the man can say another word. Blurry and perplexed, he slips into his yesterday getup and staggers to the main hall, where the monks have already begun enjoying their morning monk rations. Wishing at the least for an early snack, the man pours himself a bowl of soup and sits at a table beside some other monks. It is difficult to ascertain their religion, he notices; they all wear drab clothes fastened by hastily crafted belts, and some of them wear simple sandals while some walk barefooted. The monastery itself, too, was quite plain in appearance—no statues or lettering chiseled into the stone walls, just pleasant aesthetic patterns and the odd pillar. He has to wonder if these monks even worship any sort of higher being, or if they are simply generic monks cleverly designed so as not to suggest any religious behavior other than an unexplained aura of mystery. But why. Is there some grander purpose to all this nonsense.He turns to one of the monks sitting at his side. ""So, what do you guys do. As monks.""Fortunately disregarding the bluntness of the inquiry, the monk smiles. ""I'm afraid I can't tell you, Mr. Carmichael. You are not a monk.""""Huh. Is it a secret.""""Secrets are few and far between these days.""""Is that a yes.""""Patience is the key to all doors, my friend.""""W-what.""""A true monk knows the blue girl is—""""Okay, I get it."" Mr. Carmichael returns to his soup, a somber unknowing plaguing his mind. And yet, there's still the matter of… ""Wait. Did you say the blue girl.""The monk eyes him with mild interest.""I think I saw her yesterday, in the night. It must've been a dream, and yet I recall it so vividly I am sure it couldn't have been one. She took me to the forest, and… well, that's as far as I can remember."" He waits for the monk to respond, but he simply nods. ""Who is she.""""I cannot say, Mr. Carmichael. You are not a monk.""Reluctantly, Mr. Carmichael abandons the discussion and finishes his soup. The car has been fixed quite skillfully, in spite of the fact that, being monks, the monks likely held no prior experience in car repair. Nevertheless, he thanks them for their reception and aid and goes about his merry way.Many years later, in a manner unimaginably convenient, the same exact Mr. Carmichael (of all the Mr. Carmichaels in the world, the particular one that had been there previously) is driving down the same exact road (for some oddly specific reason and notwithstanding the chance that he has moved in the intervening years) and breaks down near the same exact monastery (which still operates in the same place and practices the same beliefs, though perhaps that bit of information is less outrageous).The same exact monks accept him, feed him, even fix his same exact car. When he lies to sleep, the same exact hum he had heard oh so long ago in the same exact place keeps him awake once more. He recognizes the sound at once, and the memory of the blue girl retakes him. Almost as if by their own accord, his legs leave the linen bed and seek the source, and soon they find themselves before her. She smiles. He smiles back.""I must show you,"" she says. That's all she said, before turning once again to the walkway.Mr. Carmichael follows her once again, and when they cross the outline of that gloomy forest, a pair of crows alight behind them, almost seeming to block their retreat. *As if we have reason to leave*, Mr. Carmichael thinks with a chuckle. This is among the last thoughts his internal monologue can summon before the feeling of floating drowns it out. He nears the singularity once again.The girl stops in the same clearing, but now in its center sits a flat object, like a thin mirror, enveloped in a thick veil of sorts. She turns to Mr. Carmichael and softly grasps the sheet, smiling with unworldly happiness. Mr. Carmichael is utterly engrossed by the veiled mirror, and then, right there—""Good morning.""""No…"" is the only thing he can mutter as it all falls away. ""Why…""""Breakfast's in the main hall.""""…why… why… why…""The monks sit with him in the main hall, but he chooses to keep some distance this time, in hopes of avoiding eccentric discourse. Yet, the soup cannot provide him company for long, and he eventually succumbs to the mortal want of society.""Hey, uh, have we met before.""The monk looks up. ""Yes, I think so.""""I saw her again.""""Hm.""""Can you please just tell me who she is. I *must* know. Her visions plague me, and I have spent countless nights pondering her.""""As I've said, Mr. Carmichael, I cannot tell you, for you are not a monk.""""Well… if I were a monk, would you tell me.""""There would be no need, for you would already know.""""Then how. How do I become a monk.""The monk raises an eyebrow. ""You would consider.""He leans forward, his face darkening in the cinematic lighting. ""I would do anything and more, sir. Nothing seems more desirable to me.""The monk contemplates him for a minute, then sighs. ""The journey to monkhood is a long and treacherous one. You must surrender everything you know about yourself. You must forget that you are Mr. Carmichael, for beyond the Three Tasks, you are not. You must leave your past life, for it shall be null if you succeed. Are you ready for such a sacrifice, Mr. Carmichael. Has the girl so utterly captivated you that you are determined to abandon these things in search of the truth.""""Yes!"" Mr. Carmichael answers sharply, though ironically not as sure as he lets on, but comfortable enough with his response—he has no background so to speak of, or at least he can't recall it. He is just a generic, run-of-the-mill, oddly resolute straight man, almost like the protagonist of some long-winded joke. As such, he has little reason to deny such a life-changing offer.""Then it shall be done,"" says the monk. ""Follow down the path outside the monastery, to the Lake of Wisdom. Master Uru will be there. Go to him, and he will guide you to monkhood.""Wasting no time besides the little needed to finish his soup, Mr. Carmichael hurries out of the monastery, descending the steep walkway leading down the mountainside. The journey is long and treacherous, but after what must be many hours, he finally approaches a colorful shore, his parched throat yearning for water.An old man sits motionless on the beach, dressed in the same drab clothes as the monks. Mr. Carmichael hesitantly nears him, full of awe at the so-called Master. He stops some distance behind him, expecting him to say some wise remark without so much as twitching a muscle, but the old man remains silent. How mystical!But some minutes pass, and the old man has still yet to utter a word. Is he really building the suspense for this long.""Uhh…"" Mr. Carmichael uhhs.""Oh, shit!"" The old man jumps and swings around. ""How long have you been standing there.!""""Er… a few minutes.""""Jesus, give me a warning next time!""""I thought you heard my footsteps.""""Well, I don't have the best hearing, do I.""""Erm…""""I…"" Master Uru's face relaxes abruptly. ""I'm sorry. I get a little anxious sometimes. I understand you've come here because you wish to attain monkhood.""""Yes, that is my want.""""Very well. A true monk possesses three qualities most important: wisdom, fidelity, and celibacy. These qualities are tested to their limits in the sacred Three Tasks, which you must complete to achieve the status of a monk. The difficulty of each Task is exponentially larger than the previous—if you are not definite on your goal, leave now, and no harm will come to you. This will not be the case later on. Is that understood.""Mr. Carmichael nods.""Now, the first Task is simple—before you lies the Lake of Wisdom."" He gestures at the vast lake. ""When you become a monk, you will not be infinitely wise at first, but it is essential that when you do acquire this wisdom, you will know how to use it. If you drink of the Lake's waters, you will, for a time, possess such wisdom. Now, what is your name.""""Nathan.""""Nathan, walk to the Lake and partake of its wisdom.""Nathan walks to the lake and partakes of its wisdom, taking deep gulps to wet his crisp throat. His eyes open, and all the knowledge he needs is at his fingertips.""Now, Nathan, I will ask of you a simple question. Take as much time as you need, but do note that the effects of the water wear off after a time. So, here it is: How many pebbles do you see.""Pebbles. Area of vision is a circle with horizon the boundary. Horizon is 2.9 miles away—area is 2π×2.9²≈52.8416 square miles. Look down. Basic measure—the foot. Assume length of 1 foot, and ratio of width to length 1:3—area of foot is about a third of a square foot. 5,280 feet in a mile—27,878,400 square feet in a square mile. Times 52.8416 is about 1,473,138,939 square feet. How many pebbles under a foot. Count—1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. Density of pebbles is 22 pebbles per third of square foot. Multiply by 1,473,138,939 square feet—97,227,169,972 pebbles. Seems too high—how much downsizing is permitted. Saw around 200 monks in monastery, oldest being about 90 years. Road adjacent to monastery is scarcely visited, maybe twice a day—65,700 visits since oldest monk birth. 1,000,000 citizens in county, so probability that a citizen visited at least once is 6.3588%. Times 1,000,000 citizens is 63,588 visits, so 2,112 are returns. Assuming every repeat visitor attempts monkhood, and 200 successful monks, the chance of passing all Three Tasks is 9.469%. Let n be the fraction of pilgrims passing the first Task. Tasks grow exponentially in difficulty due to Uru, so n² of people pass the second Task, and n³ of people pass the third, so n×n²×n³=n⁶ of people pass all Tasks and become monks, which is 9.469%. Thus, n is the 6th root of 0.09469, which is about 0.6751. Thus, there must be an allowed error of 67.51%—times the previously calculated pebble number, 97,227,169,972, is the lowest correct answer:""65,641,272,526.""""Well done. You have passed the first Task successfully. You are now ready to continue to the second."" Master Uru points to his left. ""Head north, towards the Mountain of Fidelity, and seek Master Zolath's camp. He will give you further directions if you show him this certificate."" He hands him a small plastic card, imprinted upon which are the words *APPROVED BY MASTER URU*. ""Take care, Nathan.""And so, Nathan takes off to that great Mountain of Fidelity that looms in the distance. The journey is long and treacherous, but eventually, he arrives at the foot of the mountain and sees a pillar of smoke climbing from the roof of a large tent. Weary and fatigued, he parts the flaps and peeks inside. A cloaked figure sits there before the fire, warming its hands. He steps inside.""Nathan Carmichael,"" she says motionlessly.Impressive. Nathan feels not the need to ask her how she knows his name, for he deems it quite natural for a monk, no less a Master-monk.""I've Master Uru's certificate."" He tries to hand her the card, but she is too focused on the fire.""Then you are ready.""She beckons to him, and he sits before the fire.""Here."" She hands him a plastic bottle of water, which he readily accepts. On a closer glance, he realizes that she is not merely thawing her palms—rather, she is coaxing the fire, kneading the hot air that surrounds it. To what occasion, he cannot tell.""You must be Master Zolath,"" Nathan speaks, and beneath the hood of her cloak he swears he glimpses the shadow of a grin.""Yes. The wind has led me here. It whispers the fates of all, and soon, I hope, you will learn its language.""""Woah. That's profound.""""Yes. Now, reach into the flame.""""What.""""Reach forward, into the heart of the blaze, and retrieve your torch.""Nathan scratches his head. ""Right, I get that you lot like being mystical, but what actually do you intend.""""I hide my words beneath no layers, Nathan. Send your hand into the flame—I shall keep it dormant in the meantime.""Well, this woman sure looks wise and powerful. Perhaps she truly knows the ways of the fires. Resting on this notion, Nathan shuts his eyes and sends a tentative hand through the sparks. The heat stings, but he can tell that he is safe. After a bit of feeling around his fingers happen on a long thin cylinder, which he interprets to be the aforementioned torch. He holds a tight grasp and retrieves it from the fire, and in his hand he finds, indeed, a wooden torch, with a flame dancing on its end.""This torch you hold now shall guide you through the second Task. Bring it atop the Mountain of Fidelity, where Grandmaster Venus shall accept it. Take heed, for the air over the Mountain is cold and tempestuous. You must remember to keep the torch ablaze throughout the journey, no matter the price.""""And if the torch is to extinguish."" (Nathan is starting to get the hang of monkspeak.)""Then you shall meet a fate most unfortunate.""""What does that mean.""""Who can tell. Any concrete knowledge of such a scenario would imply some level of control, which we clearly do not possess.""Nathan nods, though he is not sure what she means.""Now go—lest the flame dies early.""He gets on his feet and heads outside, firmly grasping the burning torch.""And remember,"" shouts Master Zolath from beyond the folds, ""keep the torch aflame *at all costs!*""And so, Nathan sets out to conquer the mighty Mountain of Fidelity, which now suddenly seems fifty stories taller than earlier. Having little experience (none, in fact) with mountain climbing, the idea at first startles him. The cold wind lashes at him, threatening the life of the flame, which he is to somehow bring to the peak alive. How would such an endeavor even be feasible, let alone possible.Yet, after a few minutes of scaling, Nathan seems to have happened upon the answer. The Mountain of Fidelity, certainly, had to be named aptly, for the second Task does require for any physical capabilities. All Nathan has to do is remain loyal to the torch and do all that is in his power to keep its flame alive. And surely the Task does not call for any further indulgence; to prove his fidelity he must only remain loyal.Indeed, this thought process is correct, but, once the wind begins howling, and the flame starts flickering, he panics.""No, no, no!"" He tries to hold still, so that the fire suffers less movement, but he cannot help it. The torchlight wanes, and soon there is but smolder in its place.*What am I to do.!* Nathan thinks monkly. *Think, man, think!*All he needs to do is stay loyal, but how can loyalty help him here.*""Keep the torch aflame at all costs! (costs, costs, costs…)""*There must be a way. There must be a way. There must—That's it!Nathan takes off his shirt, exposing his muscular torso to the elements. Ignoring the shivers, he wraps it around the smoldering top of the torch, which after a few tense moments catches fire and returns to its flaming state.And now, standing shirtless on the mountainside, and spotting a thick layer of ice up ahead, Nathan realizes the true meaning of fidelity.The fabric of the shirt keeps the flame busy for a time, and Nathan keeps it close to his chest as he enters the snowy portion of the mountain. He must be close to the end, he thinks—surely it can't get much colder than this.But after a while of climbing icy boulders and trudging through the snow, the flame flickers again. Shivering and groaning, Nathan looks around for something to feed it, but the ground is cold and barren. The fire has burnt through the shirt, and now asks for more. He contemplates this for a minute, and recalls what he told himself near the foot of the mountain—the Task asks for nought but his undying loyalty. If he provides this loyalty, he shall surely pass it alive.So he removes his trousers and stuffs them on the tip of the torch, which, again, soon flickers back into life. Now he is left only in his nonflammable sandals and his unfortunately flammable underpants, which he prays not to have to use.He goes forward, shaking against the biting wind, but nevertheless determined to fulfill this Task. At this point he can barely remember what the purpose of all this is. The wind shrieks at his ears, and the gelid air envelopes his naked body, almost repressing his movement. The question of mortality creeps into his mind, but he tosses it aside—he feels he does not know enough to tackle it. He only knows that he must prove his fidelity, no matter the cost.Soon, he spots a wooden building in the distance, sitting just at the edge of the fog. It is far, but the distance is finite, and that is all that matters now. Nathan glances at the torch, and to his horror, finds that it has already finished consuming his trousers. They lasted only a little longer than the shirt. He looks at the house—it is much too far away, and even if he were to make a run for it, the resulting wind would surely extinguish the flame in mere seconds.So, of course, he takes off his underpants and wraps them around the torch, and the flame lives on. His body is shaking uncontrollably, and surely if he doesn't make it to the house soon, he will die. But if he runs too hastily, and the fire is to vanish before he gets there, it will all have been useless.He walks steadily, not too quickly and hopefully not too slowly, though the constant quivering of his body makes it hard for him to verify these assumptions. He holds the torch close, but he knows the underpants won't last for long. Nathan doesn't have much self-esteem, as you can tell.His vision turns blurry, and he stumbles forward. The house must be getting closer, but it seems still so far away. At this point he has lost all feeling all around his body, and the rest of his senses gradually fade away as well. He steps forward, but his foot doesn't land on anything. At first he assumes his feet have simply lost feeling as well, but a few moments later, when he hears a dull shatter and the air suddenly turns much colder, he realizes something is wrong. His eyes open, and he finds himself suspended in water, the torch having left his grasp and lying on the edge of the icy lake.*Oh, fuck,* is the only thing he can think, before everything goes dark.…For a moment, nothing happens. Nathan's only thought is, ""I have died."" There is no emotion accompanying this statement, because it is just a simple truth. He isn't afraid, nor sad, nor angry. He is dead. That is all.But after a while, he thinks of Descartes. He can't recall what Descartes had said, but he knows that if he can think of Descartes, that means he must exist. That's a rule of thumb he'd heard from someone. And if he must exist, then he must still somehow be alive—QED.So, if he is alive, there must be something he can mold with his imagination. So he fancies a teapot, and it materializes before him, stark against the blank void all around. He fancies a teacup, and a teaspoon, and perhaps a few teacubes of teasugar, and it all appears to him. *Neat,* he thinks, pouring himself a cuppa.Next, he imagines a hot bath, and, realizing he is missing a body, imagines himself a hunky physique, imagines himself its occupier, and imagines his figure lying in the bathtub. But he still feels rather lonely, what with the infinite nothingness in all directions, so he imagines that the bathtub sits on the ledge of an expensive villa, overlooking some Scandinavian landscape. He sighs and leans back as a draft passes by. A wooded region sits near the villa, separating it from the distant mountain range, and there near the edge a crow alights on a branch. All is well.And yet, something bothers him. He did not imagine the crow. He has no reason to even think of crows. And now, the crow takes off and lands on the edge of his bathtub, unnaturally close to him. That he most certainly did not intend.""ᮿᒔኻАዼჽ᫞ᛵᾅнᄩᓳ᫘ሲЇᐷዏᰜᬛДᯌᒋዡЮ᷿ᡵᩭᝳ"" quoth the crow.""W-what.""""ᣠᄚኛὍЅቴዡፙዔᇀᰊᱹ᫹""""What does that mean.!""The crow eyes him more intently. ""Repent.""That word resonates in his fancy, ricocheting off and shattering every one of his hopes and dreams. The crow thus flies off as the world so recklessly sculpted by Nathan rapidly withers away. Then, for what must be years and years, Nathan feels nothingness. But unlike the nothingness he experienced earlier, which he saw through the comforting lens of subconsciousness, this nothingness is pure and raw, and for the first time in his life he is filled with total, unadulterated terror. And the world follows his lead, and suddenly there is cold ground beneath him, and the next moment it's gone. It has never even thought to exist. He has always been falling down, faster and faster, past universes and worlds that only exist as backgrounds for some greater web of mysticism. He sees himself for the speck he is, in the imagination of another speck in the imagination of a young man, who is a meaningless speck in a gigantic universe that is probably a speck of fanciful thinking engendered by some other speck of meaninglessness. One of these specks must exist in reality, he is certain, but is it necessarily the last one in the seemingly unending cascade. Is it even the only one. Is there such a speck at all.As if to avoid the question altogether, the Engine appears before him, one of those many tiny specks magnified to seem more significant than it is. It's a simple function, really—take as input some array of experiences and stories, process them in some mysterious fashion, and output new stories and worlds. A self-replicating particle, and this is only one of its infinite variations. On one side sits hearsay of a mysterious frozen continent—on the other, a young girl who must save the world. On one side, a boy glancing at a girl he likes—on the other, a recursive encounter between a bartender and a customer. On one side, a silly joke about monks that gets reposted to r/Jokes every 2 months—and Nathan sits on the other.And somewhere in the midst of this process sits the crow.Nathan turns around, and finds an infinite row of such Engines, each just subtly different than the rest, all being fed endless romances, tragedies and comedies, and spitting out unique, tiny universes. One speaks of a pair of atoms flirting with each other; another, giant metallic behemoths hissing in the distance; and another, a malevolent god-like being learning the power of love. And somehow, perching on some motionless cogwheel, the crow oversees them all.""The clock ticks, thou Carmichael,"" croaks the crow.Indeed, the ticking grows louder, and the flame wanes. It echoes about his head. But surely, he is still in control! The scene before him is merely a drawing on a curtain, which he promptly tears apart. But beyond the curtain, the crow perches on a pedestal, looking down woefully.""The choice is yours.""Behind the crow is a large door, through which a cold gray light illuminates the entrance. As the ticking grows, he realizes that the door won't last forever. In due course he will have to decide if he wishes to abandon these infinite powers and return to his reality. For what. What does the real world hold over the infinitely-plastic universe within his own mind. Beyond the doorway, nothing has purpose. Everything is for it is. But here, he himself assigns everything a purpose, and thus all that he begets has massive significance.Though, is the real world any different. Does nothing have significance if we do get to choose what significance even is. Is that power not inherent to all people.Then there's the question of control. Within this world, if he says ""let there be light,"" then light be there let. But out there, saying ""let there be light,"" the most he will get is a curious glare from some nearby stranger. In here, his powers have no limit—but out there, is he anything but powerless.And he recalls the Engine. A machine cannot operate without input. A self-propelled self-replicator is as good as a cancer cell. For the Engine to run it needs to see, to hear, to feel. If the Engine has nothing to feed on, it will never be able to create anything. It will remain forever stuck within its own thoughts, which will either be non-existent or unpredictably chaotic. And a man forever stuck with his own thoughts and nothing more, doubtless, is doomed to degrade to a similar fate.He needs input. He needs to see, and to hear, and to feel. He needs warmth, and sadness, and touch, and hatred, and love and joy and wonder. And all lies beyond that door.So he walks through.…Nathan opens his eyes. His naked body is submerged in near-frozen water, and with all the senses he still has he can only faintly detect the intense cold biting at his skin.He swims out of the lake and gasps deep of the icy air. The torch is still sitting there, burning faintly. Quaking uncontrollably, he snatches it and hastily makes his way towards the house in the distance. At this point, Nathan can hardly complain, even in his own head, about the severity of the situation. He seems to have lost that part of him, and whatever is left only urges him to keep going.When he reaches the door, he cannot bother to knock. He simply leans on the knob and pushes through, falling on the matted floor with a thud.The warmth within instantly thaws him; a little too quickly for his liking, in fact. His senses have not returned to him yet, and now the only thing he feels is a tingling sensation all across his skin.""Argh,"" he arghs, struggling to stir.Eventually, he hears the door closing behind him, and someone pulls him up and drags him away, although he can only assume this from his foggy vision as he still can't otherwise feel a thing. The stranger sits him down, and the thawing grows somewhat quicker. His vision sharpens a bit, and he can make out a figure pouring a mug, which it then promptly puts to Nathan's lips. ""Drink.""Nathan holds it in his pale fingers. ""W-w-wh…""""Drink it. Quickly.""He gulps the liquid down his throat and coughs. ""What is this.""""Coffee.""""Oh."" He takes another gulp, and his senses start coming back. Now he can see the room more clearly. There's a fireplace in front of him, and within it a flame, dancing and crackling happily. On the walls he finds a pair of old-fashioned windows, through which a vast view of a green valley shines, and in the same wall a glass door provides entrance to a marble balcony. Nathan finds himself sat on a crimson couch, some distance from the fireplace, and his feet in a tub of hot water. In an opposite crimson couch sits a tall man, draped in simple monk clothes, inspecting him with intrigue.""How do you feel."" the man asks.""Mm… better."" Nathan looks down and realizes that he is still naked. His mind is too fuzzy for this to embarrass him, but he would feel better not exposed to the air. ""Do you have a blanket.""The man smiles. ""Monk code requires that a candidate remain bare until the third Task.""""Oh.""""But yes, I should have a blanket somewhere.""The man gets up and rummages through some cabinets on the other side of the room, and after a minute finds a white sheet which he tosses onto Nathan's body.""Thank you."" He takes another gulp of his coffee. ""You're Grandmaster Venus, right.""The man chuckles. ""So she told you, I trust.""Nathan nods slowly.""It seems she's grown fond of confusing you lot."" He sits back down and smiles. ""I'm Master Zolath. The woman you met at the foot of the mountain is Grandmaster Venus. She swapped our names for her amusement.""""Oh. But what about Master Uru. He told me I'd meet Zolath at the tent.""""Yes, perhaps we should bring him up to date."" Master Zolath pours himself a cup of coffee. ""We were originally swapped. I was the guide for the second Task, and Venus was here, for the third Task, this House of Celibacy. I think you can imagine why she wished to swap places.""""Mhm.""""So now I am in charge of this burden, which for my sake and… well, probably for yours, too—although I don't judge—I'd rather we just sit here for however long you're required to… er, 'resist.'""He nods in agreement.""So what is your name.""""Oh, uh, Nathan. I thought you'd already know. You know, being a Master and whatnot.""""No, no, unfortunately. Only the Grandmaster holds such mystical powers.""Nathan takes another sip, nearly emptying his mug. ""Well, I've come this far—could you perhaps indulge me in the fabled secrets of the monks.""""Only when you become a monk.""""When will that be.""""In about…"" He surveys his watch. ""4 minutes. Not doing too bad. How are you feeling, Nathan.""""Well."" The feeling has almost fully returned to his fingers.""Can you walk.""""I'll try."" He draws his feet from the hot water and places them on the floor. The joy of warmth subsides quite tragically and the skin longs for the past, but otherwise he is fine. He ties the blanket about his neck, stands up with a deep groan, and steps along the carpet for a minute. ""Yeah.""""Good."" Master Zolath sets his cup on the table and gets on his feet. ""I'd like to tell you some words in private."" He gestures at the balcony.""Outside.""""If it's not too much trouble.""They step out onto the overhang, where the air is significantly colder, and yet, with the blanket, liveable. The valley is spread out before them, glimmering joyfully in the reflections of the sinking sun, and right below them a steep walkway leads down the mountain and merges with the green.""I take it the pond befell you,"" says Master Zolath.""The Pond.""""No, no, just the pond. It's no official name—everyone falls in it, so we just call it the pond.""""Well, yes, then.""""So you have witnessed the Engine.""""…Yes.""""Then you must understand that you cannot revert your path.""""Yes. Wait, no. What do you mean.""Master Zolath leans on the pale railing and heaves a heavy sigh. ""Nathan, over the years I have seen the views of our monastery morph about. As Masters fall and rise, the values they preach grow ever so slightly different. The pond has been crucial to this metamorphosis, and the secrets it unveiled have affected our operations significantly."" His glassy eyes rest on Nathan's. ""You've seen her, haven't you.""Nathan hesitates for a moment, then nods vaguely. ""Who is she.""""The last of the mallocs. The final remnant of those that crafted the Engine.""""What happened to the rest.""He closes his eyes. ""The twilight fell on them.""A tense quiet follows, and Nathan isn't really sure what to say, or how to interpret the Master's words. Surely the twilight is an allegory of some kind (or a metaphor; he never really understood the difference), and it falling on the mallocs alludes to some unfortunate fate, but which exactly, he cannot extrapolate. However, fearing disrespecting the mystical obscurity of the Master's discourse, he inquires further not.""Nathan, I know not where the wind should take you, but if you must go on, I only ask of you one thing.""""What's that.""""The malloc still controls the Engine. If she is joyous, the Engine will make joy. If she is in pain, the Engine shall make pain. And pain I have seen. Such terrible, awful pain."" He turns to Nathan. ""The malloc will not live forever. And if she is to perish naturally, she will surely bring the Engine down with her. Do you understand.""""…yes.""""I'm sorry. It's the only way."" His eyes return to the valley. A crow alights nearby, and starts pecking at a bush. ""You're free to go, Nathan. Take the path down the mountain and to the Caldera of Ordination, where you will become a monk.""""Thank you, Master Zolath.""The journey to the end of the world requires arduous planning and preparation, but the journey to the Caldera of Ordination is easier. Nathan takes only a few hours to scale down the mountain, clutching his blanket tightly, but as the view of the steamy spring grows closer, his fingers gradually thaw back.At the margin, he finds another monk, with clothes much shorter than his brethren's. He stands next to a wooden boat, and as Nathan nears him, he notices the sweat dripping from his forehead.""You are ready,"" the monk says raspily. ""Climb in.""He rows Nathan into the midst of the caldera, and the steam grows thick and dense, obscuring their vision. Nathan's heart is pounding restlessly, though he isn't sure if this is because of the excitement or because he has trouble breathing.Minutes later, a small island, certainly in the dead center of the spring, emerges from beyond the steam curtains. Numerous stone structures decorate it, and circling them are a handful of monks, all wearing short monk clothes, their faces hidden by veils. They seem to be chanting something, though they might just be mindlessly humming.""Step forward, child,"" says the monk who rowed him.Nathan, a little irritated by his condescending address, nevertheless walks into the center of the monk circle. The steam grows even thicker, and soon he fails to witness the monks surrounding him.""Take the blanket off your skin.""He takes his blanket off his skin, and the steam nears and licks his naked body. The humming of the monks grows louder, and the feeling of levitating returns to his feet. He closes his eyes, and somewhere, in there, he dimly sees the light. The truth is there. It has always been there, and now he will understand it. The humming grows louder. Everything is lighting up. It's all starting to make sense. Yes, yes, this is it! This is the light! This is what it's all been for! The light is here! The light is—**Wake up.**What—what was that. What's going on.**Wake up, Nathan.**No, no, no! Everything is falling away! The light! The light is retreating! It's all shattering! Why.!**Jesus, what did he take.!****Nathan!**Everything is dying. Everything is dying. Everything is dying. And the truth is gone.""Nathan!""""*Shut up! Shut the fuck up!*""He looks around, breathing heavily. There's a room. It's a small room, maybe a living room. There's a window in the corner, and a streetlight blinks beyond it some distance away. He turns his head. There are people there. Two boys at his side, and a girl sitting on the carpet, wearing headphones. They all stare at him.It becomes apparent to him that he is the one who screamed those words.""Are you okay."" asks one of the boys.""Y-yeah. Sorry.""He looks at his companion. ""He had a bad trip.""""Yeah, no shit, Uri!""""What're you mad at me for. You gave him the stuff!""""I didn't give him anything, I don't know where he got it!""Nathan says nothing. He is too bewildered by the horrible feeling flooding his mind.""Zack,"" the girl calls, ""check his pulse.""The other boy pulls up Nathan's sleeve and presses a finger to his wrist. ""He's fine.""""I need…"" Nathan murmurs.Zack looks at him. ""What.""""I need a breather.""He exchanges a worried expression with Uri, who nods grimly. ""Alright.""""Wait, he can't go!"" says the girl. ""Look at him! He's in shock! We need to—""""Vera,"" Uri says seriously. ""Let him.""She opens her mouth to object, but closes it a moment later and sighs.Nathan leaves soon afterwards, entering the rainy night. The orange streetlights reflect on the pavement, breaking up and shattering into indistinct blurs. Slow, jazzy music plays in a nearby building, attentuated by the veils of time and space.He steps into the darkness of a small alleyway, chained metal clanging at his feet. A crow lands yonder, glaring through its ebony eyes. Nathan blinks, and the alley gradually turns gray, whatever life left in it draining away so quickly. Then it stops, and all that remains is its frozen ghost, whose only physicality is being a background to a distant black car, which now approaches him. It brakes some distance away, making a terrible noise against the pavement. The crow hops onto the car and turns to him.""Get in, thou Carmichael.""""What. My name's not Michael.""The crow groans, then beckons him forward. Nathan climbs into the car and sits himself comfortably against the cushioned backseat. Soon enough, an abstract landscape speeds by the window, through other worlds and times, and as this is all happening, Nathan can't help but feel empty and minute against the vast scale of it all. He is doomed to forever be a marionette in the hands of a marionette which is held in the hands of an infinite tower of strings and marionettes. That much was made clear by Master Zolath, who may or may not even exist. Which begs the question—does the monastery exist. Does the Engine exist. Does he, even, exist.And does it really matter. If everything that can possibly exist is just a figment of imagination of imagination of imagination of imagination, does existing even have a valid definition. Is it anything more than an expression of want to be significant, or to stand out in the void.The car stops. Beyond the window, Nathan sees woods. Thick woods, shading the bushes and plants from the dim, metal-blue sky, where pink clouds hover. Quiet. And there, in the distance, the malloc stands.He soon finds himself at her side, almost levitating over the grass. Through the thicket he catches only glimpses of the ever so peaceful skies.""We do not get to choose who the twilight falls upon,"" she says.Nathan nods sympathetically.They reach the clearing again, and in the center once more sits the veiled Mirror. The malloc stops under the shade and smiles at him. He smiles back, then walks forward, towards the Mirror. His heart races, his hands shake, and he realizes that the truth may still be out there, after all.He pulls the veil, and—"	1.0

How do giraffes drink water. They don't, you stupid fuck. Have you seen how high their fucking heads go. How in the fuck do you think they could bend down to drink from a puddle. They'd have to find a fucking waterfall every time they wanted a drink. There would be an entire ecosystem of giraffes living solely around all the waterfalls in the world. They'd never be able to go more than a couple miles from one, a slave to the H20. Great. Now we've hypothetically enslaved the fucking giraffes. But then again...Doesnt that mean we're all a slave to the H20.Never more than three days, they said. Three days without water and you'll find death.My life...seems so restricted now. Like there's a chain from the soft liquid to my body, refusing to sway from my cries for freedom.I am made from this water though.In that I find a little solace.

They patiently wait for Archangel's return and finally, after three months, he arrives with a smile on his face:– Great news you two! I found out that yes, you can get married in heaven!So the young couple says:– Listen, Michael, we were wondering, what if we stop loving each other and want to get a divorce in the future, is that possible.

Is there anyway you could carry it through Customs for me. Under your robes perhaps."" the woman asked. ""I would love to help you, but I must warn you: I will not lie!"" The priest told her. ""With your honest face, Father, no one will question you,"" she said. When they got to Customs, the young woman let the priest go ahead of her. The Customs official asked, ""Father, do you have anything to declare."" ""From the top of my head down to my waist, I have nothing to declare,"" said the priest. The officials thought this answer a bit strange, so he asked, ""And what to you have to declare from your waist to the floor, Father.""

"Where is my goat. There were these two guys out hiking when they came upon an old, abandoned mine shaft. Curious about its depth they threw in a pebble and waited for the sound of it striking the bottom, but they heard nothing. They went and got a bigger rock, threw it in and waited. Still nothing. They searched the area for something larger and came upon a railroad tie. With great difficulty, the two men carried it to the opening and threw it in. While waiting for it to hit bottom, a goat suddenly darted between them and leapt into the hole!The guys were still standing there with astonished looks upon their faces from the actions of the goat when a man walked up to them. He asked them if they had seen a goat anywhere in the area and they said that one had just jumped into the mine shaft in front of them! The man replied, ""Oh no. That couldn't be my goat, mine was tied to a railroad tie."""	1.0

How did you die. Two men waiting at the Pearly Gates strike up a conversation. ‘How'd you die.’ the first man asks the second. ‘I froze to death,’ says the second. ‘That's awful,’ says the first man. ‘How does it feel to freeze to death.’ ‘It's very uncomfortable at first’, says the second man. ‘You get the shakes, and you get pains in all your fingers and toes. But eventually, it's a very calm way to go. You get numb and you kind of drift off, as if you're sleeping. How about you, how did you die.’ ‘I had a heart attack,’ says the first man. ‘You see, I knew my wife was cheating on me, so one day I showed up at home unexpectedly. I ran up to the bedroom, and found her alone, knitting. I ran down to the basement, but no one was hiding there, either. I ran up to the second floor, but no one was hiding there either. I ran as fast as I could to the attic, and just as I got there, I had a massive heart attack and died.’ The second man shakes his head. ‘That's so ironic,’ he says. ‘What do you mean.’ asks the first man. ‘If you had only stopped to look in the freezer, we'd both still be alive.’	1.0

"What's a penguin. A poor man is walking through a red light district and decides to try to get a deal on a prostitute for the evening. He walks into a whore house and asks,  ""What can I get for $5.""""Absolutely nothing. Get the hell out of here."" comes the reply. He tries one after another with similar lack of success. He comes to his last option and pleads desperately with the pimp, ""Look man, I've only got $5. I'm desperate. I'll take whatever you have to offer, anything. Just a blow job would be enough."" ""$5 isn't nearly enough for a blow job."" The pimp laughs.""Well, how about just a hand job."" The man asks desperately.""Nope, not enough for a hand job buddy."" the pimp replies. The poor man turns to leave but the pimp adds, ""Look, I might be able to do something for ya bud. $5 isn't enough for even a hand job.. but you can get a penguin for that."" ""What is a penguin."" asks the man. ""You'll see."" the pimp replies grinning. The man considers his options. He knows his $5 won't get him anything anywhere else so he figures, ""What the hell, I'll take it."" The pimp takes his $5 then leads him back to a room and tells him one of the girls will be with him shortly. He's standing in a room in a whore house wondering what he's about to be in for when in comes a prostitute. She isn't a bad looking girl, in fact she's pretty attractive. Without saying a word she undoes his belt and zipper, drops his pants, and goes to town. She's giving him great head and the man thinks to himself, ""Damn, this is great!"" He's getting close to climaxing but before he cums the prostitute stands up, turns around, and walks out of the room. The man is confused and tries to follow her but his pants are around his ankles so he's only waddling after her and he shouts, ""Hey, what's a penguin!."""	1.0

"If your parents had a child that wasn't your brother or sister, then who would it be. One day Obama was visiting the queen of England. He asked her how she ran such an efficient government. She said ""I only surround myself with intelligent people, watch this"" and she called in England's prime minister, David Cameron. She asked him ""If your parents had a child that is not your brother or sister, then who is it."" David replied, ""well, it would have to be me"". The queen was very pleased and Obama was very impressed. Out of curiosity when he returned home, he decided to ask Joe Biden the question. He asks Biden ""If your parents have a child that isn't your brother or sister, then who is it."" Biden thought long and hard. ""Let me get back to you on that Mr.President"". So Biden spends the entire day thinking and researching the question. He runs into former president George Bush. He asks Bush the same question. ""George, if your parents had a child that wasn't your brother or sister, then who would it be."" George Bush replies, ""Well, it would be me"". So Biden runs back to the white house and excitedly tells Obama he figured out the question. He says ""I figured it out, it would be George Bush!"" Obama replies ""No you dumbfuck, it would be David Cameron"""	1.0

"Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or Endothermic (absorbs heat). The following is an actual question given on a University of Washington engineering mid-term. The answer was so ""profound"" that the Professor shared it with colleagues, and the sharing obviously hasn't ceased...Bonus Question: Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or Endothermic (absorbs heat).Most of the students wrote Proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law, (gas cools off when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or some variant. One student, however, wrote the following:""First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let us look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially.Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are added. This gives two possibilities:1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.2. Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.So which is it.If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa Banyan during my Freshman year, ""...that it will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you."", and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then, #2 cannot be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and will not freeze.""This student received the only A."	1.0

Harry answered, ""I'm too smart for the 1st grade. My sister is in the 3rd grade and I'm smarter than she is!  I think I should be in the 3rd grade too!""Ms. Brooks had enough.  She took Harry to the principal's office. While Harry waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the principal what the situation was. The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test.  If he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the 1st grade and behave.  She agreed. Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he agreed to take the test. Principal: ""What is 3 x 3.""Harry: ""9.""Principal: ""What is 6 x 6.""Harry: ""36.""And so it went with every question the principal thought a 3rd grader should know. The principal looks at Ms. Brooks and tells her, ""I think Harry can go to the 3rdgrade.""Ms. Brooks says to the principal, ""Let me ask him some questions.""The principal and Harry both agreed.Ms. Brooks asks, ""What does a cow have four of that I have only two of.""Harry, after a moment: ""Legs.""Ms Brooks: ""What is in your pants that you have but I do not have.""The principal wondered why would she ask such a question! Harry replied: ""Pockets.""Ms. Brooks: ""What does a dog do that a man steps into."" Harry: ""Pants.""The principal sat forward with his mouth hanging open. Ms. Brooks: ""What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky.""The principal's eyes opened really wide and before he could stop the answer, Harry replied, ""Bubble gum.""Ms. Brooks: ""What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs.""Harry: ""Shake hands.""The principal was trembling. Ms. Brooks: ""What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' that means a lot of heat and excitement.""Harry: ""Firetruck.""The principal breathed a sigh of relief and told the teacher, ""Put Harry in the fifth-grade, I got the last six questions wrong...

What's Behind The Fig Leaf. A nun, badly needing to use the restroom, walked into a local Hooters. The place was hopping with music and loud conversation and every once in a while ‘the lights would turn off.’ Each time the lights would go out, the place would erupt into cheers. However, when the revelers saw the nun, the room went dead silent. She walked up to the bartender, and asked, ‘May I please use the restroom. The bartender replied, ‘OK, but I should warn you that there is a statue of a naked man in there wearing only a fig leaf.’ ‘Well, in that case, I’ll just look the other way,’ said the nun. So the bartender showed the nun to the back of the restaurant. After a few minutes, she came back out, and the whole place stopped just long enough to give the nun a loud round of applause. ! She went to the bartender and said, ‘Sir, I don’t understand. Why did they applaud for me just because I went to the restroom.’ ‘Well, now they know you’re one of us,’ said the bartender, ‘Would you like a drink.’ ‘No thank you, but, I still don’t understand,’ said the puzzled nun. ‘You see,’ laughed the bartender, ‘every time someone lifts the fig leaf on that statue, the lights go out. Now, how about that drink.	1.0

Joke, It's okay guys, I'm asian so I can write it) So there's a White guy, a Black guy, and an Asian Guy.They were all on a tv show with one woman. The catch of this show was to bring a women to tears, by bringing out her emotions. The White guy bought her a caramel latte from StarBucks, thinking such gifts would make this girl get on her knees and beg him to take her, but He failed and gave up. The black man was next. He thought that emotions could rile her up to cry. So he talked about how he would love her like the Father he never had, he ended up crying, failed and left the show. Now it was the Asian mans turn. He walked in like a boss and whispered into her ear ""Hey, you sexay laadddaayyy, You want duh luving pho cheap."" as he gently stroked the side of her face. It was after that, that she finally broke down into tears, crying unendingly. After the show, the two men asked the asian guy, how the hell he did that. The asian guy replied, it's an old trick I learned from my ancestors and has been passed down for generations. I rub ghost pepper on hand and rub her face, she cry after."	1.0

Who doesn't like a blonde joke. A blonde walks into a bank in New York City and asks for the loan officer. She says she’s going to Europe on business for two weeks and needs to borrow $5,000. The bank officer says the bank will need some kind of security for the loan, so the blonde hands over the keys to a new Rolls Royce. The car is parked on the street in front of the bank; she has the title, and everything checks out. The bank agrees to accept the car as collateral for the loan. The bank’s president and its officers all enjoy a good laugh at the blonde for using a $250,000 Rolls as collateral against a $5,000 loan. An employee of the bank then drives the Rolls into the bank’s underground garage and parks it there. Two weeks later, the blonde returns and repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41. The loan officer says, “Miss, we are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely; but we are a little puzzled. We checked you out and found that you are a multimillionaire. What puzzles us is - why would you bother to borrow $5,000.” The blond replies…..“Where else in New York City can I park my car for two weeks for only $15.41 and expect it to be there when I return.”	1.0

"Death, or Tonga. Three shipwrecked sailors, Al, Bill and Charlie, wash up on a tropical island somewhere in the pacific. As they explore the island they are captured by a tribe of savages. The savages brings them before the chief to decide what to do with them.The chief steps up to Al and growls at him ""I give you choice: Death, or Tonga...""Al don't know what Tonga is, but it sure can't be worse than death, right. So he chooses Tonga.""Alright,"" says the chief ""you are free to go"" and points him down the beach that stretches along the ocean.""That was easy"" thinks Al and starts walking down the beach. But as he comes a ways down the beach, suddenly two burly naked hunters with huge erections jump out of the bushes next to the beach. Al starts running, but they soon catch up with him, pins him down and starts violently sodomizing him.As Al is screaming in agony and lost dignity, the chief turns to Bill growling ""You! Choose: Death, or Tonga...""Bill who is clever thinks to himself that if he gets a running start, he can probably outrun the savages on the beach, especially as they are busy pounding Al, and so maybe he can get away with his dignity and asshole intact. So he also choses Tonga. The chief dismisses him as well, and he starts hauling his precious ass down the beach as fast as he possibly can, running past poor Al and the two hunters who are yet busy, down the beach a few hundred yards more. As he comes up to a bend suddenly four other burly naked hunters with huge erections jumps out of the bushes, quickly catches him, pins him down in the sand and starts having their way with him.Charlie, watching his two fallen comrades getting their asses pounded by the savages on the beach can barely stomach the sight, and having understood his choice is between death and a thorough ass ramming by huge sweaty savages, he stoicly decides that any fate is better than that, and that at least he will face his destiny with his dignity intact.So when the chief growls ""You! Death or Tonga."", Charlie, head held high, firmly answers ""I choose Death!""""Very well..."" the chief responds, ""Death it shall be! DEATH BY TONGA!"""	1.0

The son asks the father, “Dad, how many kinds of boobs are there.” The father, surprised, answers, “Well, son, a woman goes through three phases. In her 20s, a woman’s breasts are like melons, round and firm. In her 30s and 40s, they are like pears, still nice, hanging a bit. After 50, they are like onions.” “Onions.” the son asks. “Yes. You see them and they make you cry.” This infuriated his wife and daughter. The daughter asks, “Mom, how many different kinds of willies are there.” The mother smiles and says, “Well, dear, a man goes through three phases also. In his 20s, his willy is like an oak tree, mighty and hard. In his 30s and 40s, it’s like a birch, flexible but reliable. After his 50s, it’s like a Christmas tree.” “A Christmas tree.” the daughter asks. “Yes, dead from the root up and the balls are just for decoration.”	1.0

She figures since she's got another 30 or 40 years she might as well make the most of it. She walks out of the hospital after the last operation and is killed by an ambulance speeding up to the hospital.  She arrives in front of God and asks, ""I thought you said I had another 30-40 years.""  God replies, ""Sorry...I didn't recognize you."""	1.0

Why did the old pirate decide to give up a-plunderin. He just wanted to move on, start a new chapter in his life. Sometimes things happen like this, and it's a nice reminder that we are all capable of change. Sure it's tough, some people in your life might move on from how they used to be - but this doesn't mean they don't love you anymore. The pirate may stop a-plunderin, but he's still the same person.

"Does anyone else remember this joke. So, I only remember the main line and the punchline from this joke.  It was probably the first naughty joke I ever heard and I think I probably heard it back in 1990 or earlier.  I tried to Google it and couldn't find anything at all.  One thing I know is it's a really dumb joke but it's the kind of joke that is funny to a grade school kid. The repeated line through about two or three different levels is, ""I'm the big bad wolf from Tennessee, I'll knock your balls into a tree"" and the punchline (don't ask me to remember how it gets here) is ""I'm the big bad devil from downtown, I'll fry your balls a toasty brown.""I know it sounds like a turrible joke, but I just gotta remember how it went, if anyone knows.  We had this little one or three page circular that some bars, bait shops or stores would keep called something like the Redneck Joker or the Rural Joker (can't remember) and it had a lot of dirty jokes in it.  A lot of jokes I heard, came from this and I wouldn't doubt if this particular joke was in it.  "	1.0

Suddenly, an Islamic Terrorist with a huge knife comes around the corner, locks eyes with you, screams obscenities, praises Allah, raises theknife, and charges at you. You are carrying a Glock 40 caliber. What do you do.***The Democrat’s Answer:**Well, that’s not enough information to answer the question!Does the man look poor or oppressed.Have I ever done anything to him that would inspire him to attack.Could we run away.What does my wife/husband think.What about the kids.Could I possibly swing the gun like a club and knock the knife out of his hand.What does the law say about this situation.Does the Glock have appropriate safety built into it.Why am I carrying a loaded gun anyway, and what kind of message does this send to society and to my children.Is it possible he’d be happy with just killing me.Does he definitely want to kill me, or would he be content just to wound me.If I were to grab his knees and hold on, could my family get away while he was stabbing me.Should I call 9-1-1.Why is this street so deserted.We need to raise taxes, have a paint and weed day, and make this happier, healthier street that would discourage such behavior.This is all so confusing! I need to debate this with some friends for few days and try to come to a consensus.**The Republican’s Answer:**BANG!**The Southerner’s Answer:**BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!BANG!

So, now you have a chicken, that grows from day to day. It'll give you another two options: you can sell it or you can bring a cockerel and get more chicken eggs in a while.-- Is this what alternative means.-- Not yet. Later, as you get more eggs, you can sell 'em for some money or you can keep 'em and in a while get even more chickens and cockerels.-- So, that is an alternative.-- Be patient, son, 'coz now you have quite a number of chickens and cockerels and you can sell all of them. Or you can keep part of them to produce more and more eggs and chikens.-- Bla-bla-bla, is it finally what alternative means.-- Nope. You see, you keep producing and selling eggs and chicken, your farm grows, your income increases, you're well and happy, until finally one day you find out that there's some bloody chicken flu and all your chicken business is fucked up and ruined.-- SO IS THAT AN ALTERNATIVE., -- cries out his son.-- No, son, ducks is an alternative."	1.0

"So, as everyone knows, two different species (flavors) of cheerios cannot mate, right. That is, if one is honey-nut and another is blueberry, they cannot mate. Anyway, there is this one normal cheerio that is in love with a blueberry cheerio. Unfortunately, he cannot mate with her. He can't even communicate with her because they are of different species. So, he invents a machine that changes all of his CNA (Cheerio DNA) into whichever type of cheerio that he wants. However, this machine performs a process that is extraordinarily painful, because that sort of thing would hurt. Anyway. He does it, and the normal flavored cheerio becomes a blueberry cheerio. Unfortunately, this girl cheerio hates him so much that she invents an identical machine and does the process on herself in order to become a cinnamon-apple cheerio, just so she can avoid this creeper. So, she does it. The boy cheerio is starting to get upset at this because he really wants her. So he tells himself that he will go through the pain for her, and becomes a cinnamon-apple cheerio. She then changes to a honey-nut cheerio! He decides that this is the last time that he will change cheerio type. He does it, and she changes one more time, into a normal cheerio - the kind he originally was. So he says out loud, ""Okay, this is really the last time. If she changes again, I will just stay back with my family."" So he becomes a normal cheerio again, and she doesn't change fast enough for him to put his moves on her. So, they start dating, and he finally asks her to the Formal Bowl (ahaha, get it, bowl instead of ball). Anyway, they get there and dance intensely for a few hours. Finally, they get tired and she sends the boy cheerio to the milk bowl (you know, since it's a cereal dance, they have that and punch). He gets there and stands in line for ten minutes. Finally fed up at the really long line, he looks over at the bowl of punch and realizes there is no punch line."	1.0

Puns I do not like. Some may be mean, do not say you were warned. I hate toilet puns cause they are always s****y. Interestingly, puns about paraplegics are always lame, its hard to see where puns about the blind are going, and no arm no leg puns never get anywhere. The final type of pun I do not like are resurrection puns, cause they always come back after they die.  Man, I must have been walking on a barrel, cause I was on a roll, but I must have run out of water, cause I am out of steam.	1.0

"A vivid man walked into a bar. He had the wildest and most chaotic brain in the earth. He could spell of horrors rivaling the unknown that lurk in the vast recesses of outer space.He could pacify the dozens and dozens with these stories, all using his brain. Once he told me, that bartender who's been serving me drinks for the past 23 years, had been hiding a gigantic 🍆. (I've censored what he said with emojis so that you won't be in grave danger.) I asked, ""You're kidding me, right. I wholeheartedly refuse to believe that man has even an above average 🍆, more so a goliath of a 🍆"".But the vivid man whispered to me, ""Look, and you will see a circus."" And so, reluctantly, I asked the bartender, If I could see his 🍆. I have to admit, I have seen some 🍆 in my life, but all of them were shivering and miniscule compared to what the vivid man described. The bartender was half-embarrassed and half-amused. He has been waiting for the day to reveal his 🍆 to his family, but was afraid if they would shun him or not. He figured that I could give an opinion if this was a 🍆 to show or a 🍆 to hide. And so he dropped his 🍆 on the table, making a clap that angels could hear. I was tranced. Albeit in a horrifying way, doubting everything that I had known up to this point. This was not a 🍆 to be admired, but why was I so seduced by it. My wife, my children, I feel as if I have to abandon them, just because this 🍆 has entered my purview. This magnificent and malignant 🍆, both destroyed my life and gave me a reason to start again. I wanted to kiss his 🍆. To hug his 🍆. To beg for his 🍆 as if it was oxygen. This 🍆 was now my salvation, my messiah, my provider. The 🍆 would feed me when I was starving. The 🍆 would spare me some liquid when I was thirsty. This 🍆 was my fountain where I would rest and bathe and worship. No, no, no, no. This can't be, that 🍆 is not perfect. It is just as fragile as me, as human as me, as needing of protection as me. The 🍆 has to know that we both are broken, but with each other, the 🍆 and I can be as one. I will let the 🍆 enter my body. I will let the 🍆 penetrate my mind. I am ready to take the blow to protect this 🍆. The 🍆 will replenish me with periodic strength, while I shield the 🍆 from harm. The 🍆 and I are destined to be with each other, knowing it has picked me and I have picked the 🍆. I cannot thank the vivid man enough for letting me know of the 8th wonder of nature. The 🍆 is drooling with enthusiasm and I am too. The bartender as well is happy for me, having been freed of his 🍆 burden. The 🍆 and I lived happily ever after. The End. The listeners asked me, ""Where is the punchline. I thought this was an elaborate dick joke."" The punchline is you dumdum. I have made you read smut by making you fill in the blanks that were never there."	1.0

"A Round of Double Jeopardy What is it, darling. You want to REALLY know what happened that night. Well you're lucky baby girl, I'm the narrator of this obtuse story we got right here, so why don't you just sit right back and enjoy the show.Trebek had tinnitus. But it wasn't just your gramma's tinnitus, his had voices that would tell him the right questions to every answer. But today, they were telling him something very different.""Ohh Lordy-doo... never thought I'd be so erotically seduced by a man older than me..."" thought Trebek. ""Alex, Alex, keep it in your pants, we have a show to run."" And so he announced the Categories for Double Jeopardy. ""and lastly, Anti-Anti-Jokes"" said Trebek, to which his Tinnitus retorted.Tinnitus: What is this whole subreddit about. ""I'll take Anti-Anti-Joke for 400, Alex. "" said Chekhov with a winky face. ""Oh, don't you wink at me... "" said Trebek. And the tinnitus retorted again. Tinnitus: What would the reader say about me dropping meta hints like acknowledging it's all meta. ""Just look at his hunk of a figure, ohh and his guns are so oily and wet... I bet that he's hiding a massive bush down there, like astroturf."" Trebek thought while daydreaming about Chekhov. ""A sentient dreidel walked into a bar. "" said Trebek, to which his Tinnitus retorted productively. Tinnitus: What is a setup. ""What is a punchline."" said Chekhov, flexing with his ginormous guns. They're just oiled up to perfection, you know. ""Just this once, I'll give you a do-over."" said Trebek. The tinnitus then retorted. Tinnitus: What should I say to the readers who still don't understand that I'm making a question to a previous statement said by somebody, showing the meta-narrative of this anti-anti-joke. Is this even an anti-anti-joke. Does this even count as a joke. Am I going crazy. Trebek was now annoyed by his Tinnitus having an existential crisis. But he needed it, because he needed the questions. He lathered oil on himself to destress. ""What is a punchline."" said Chekhov, again, not knowing what a setup is. In fact all he knows is how to punch, with those oiled up GUNS. Punch Punch Punch.Trebek was now annoyed by both his Tinnitus and Chekhov. But Chekhov is still hot AF, and beneath his bush lays his hypothetical scrotum. We know he has a scrotum, but does he have the balls. Are they as big as a grape. A grapefruit. A cartwheel. A cart. Or are they none of the above. ""I'll have Anti-Anti-Joke for 800."" said Chekhov, like a male dominatrix. ""You can't do that."" said Trebek. Tinnitus: What do we say to authors who just introduce a plot element out of the blue without setting it up first.Chekhov then took out the Bible, and with Jesus Christ, commanded unto Trebek: ""Of course I could, it's an anti-anti-joke dumdum."" Then flew away riding with Jesus on a double-entendre. The tinnitus retorted: Wait, could Chekhov have known that we were all in an anti-anti-joke. ""Wait a minute, look at the first two words of this whole essay! We were a Jeopardy Question all along! Truly Meta!"" said Trebek. ""But since this is an anti-anti-joke, there must be a reference to the other anti-anti-jokes!"" said the Narrator.63. Read the passage above then answer this question. What is an anti-anti-joke. A. Grape. B. Grapefruit. C. Cartwheel. D. Cart. E. None of the above. Correct Answer: A, B or D. I lied about the wheels."	1.0

The entire cafe erupts with laughter. So the lawyer says, “That’s not his foot, that’s my wallet!” A waiter walking by accidentally kicks the wallet on the ground mistaking it for a man’s foot. He says to the priest, “Excuse me, would you please move your foot. It’s in the way of the other customers.”The wind causes the lawyer to drop his wallet onto the floor beside the priest’s dark shoes. The lawyer, clearly excited about something, says to the priest, “Check out my new wallet! I just bought it today. I’ve stuffed it full. It weighs as much as a shoe!” And just as the lawyer says this a violent gust of wind rips through the cafe patio.

""Good job!"" said someone else who works at the bank.  ""Thank you"" I said, as everyone congratulated me.  Even the people that had been killed by the marshmallow thanked me as they descended to hell.  ""We'll take it from here, sir"" said the police as they came in, handcuffed the marshmallow, and took it away in their police car.  When I woke up, my *pillow* was *gone*."	1.0

Instant Karma So, this snotty brat stole a glas of instant karma at Whole Foods. When he was home he sneaked past his mom - who was watching cable TV - into the kitchen and put the kettle on. After a while the water was boiling violently , so he let it cool down a bit before he poured over the instant karma. He thought it was still too hot and waited until it was just about 70°C warm. Then he poured the karma on his laptop. It didn't help, Reddit was down again. He was reborn as a youtuber who makes really good videos about gardening and landscape architecture.	1.0
"A 7'3 man walks into a bar with his 6'8 12 year old son ""What are you fellas drinking."" The elderly barman asks.""Carlsberg for me and a diet cola for the boy. He's got practice tomorrow."" The man replies.""No problemo."" The barman turns around. ""You got any ID, bud."""" He says, back turned.""What. For a coke. You're kidding, right."" The 12 year old says.""No. I was talking to you."" The barman points to the man.""Oh."" The man shows his ID.""25, huh."" The barman smiles up at the man.""Yup. And Tristan here is 12. Got a college sophomore pregnant when I was just 13 myself. Bad decisions. She got arrested, went to jail and my parents adopted the kid. Graduated from college a few years back and I'm now his legal parent.""""I...see. Do you ever wish you could go back and change things."" The barman asks.""No! Of course not! Tristan's a cool kid. And I'm sorry I ruined Tilly's life - woman I got pregnant - but things happen for a reason."" The man replies, now sipping his cold beer.""You do realize that I'm an antigenie, right."" The barman grins.""What. The hell is that.!"" The man says.At that point, the barman suddenly transforms into a very dark-skinned clone of Tom Jones and begins singing the hit single ""It's Not Unusual"", with music blaring out from the bar's speakers.The 25 year old is then whisked back in time to UC Berkeley's campus and is 13 years old again and he sees Tilly the college sophomore but pushes her off of him before they have sex and runs back home. Decades later, he is now a homeless man begging for change in a rundown quarantined Sacramento whilst Tilly the sophomore is known by millions of Americans as President Matilda Ibrahim Jefferson Washington III, ""the President holding America together"".Tristan, the 6'8 12 year old is not born, although thousands of miles away, in a small town 20 miles south of Paris, France is a 23 year old who goes by the same name. He is known by locals as ""Tristan the antigenie"" and he grants what you definitely don't wish for."	1.0

"A Man Walks in to A Bar  A man walks in to a bar.The barman says ""knock knock"".""who's there."" say's the man. He stands and observes the drab, middle-of-the-road interior. A buzzing strip light, cold tilled walls, a crummy counter and a small fly buzzing lazily around the million mile stare adorning the vacant expression of the patron. A man appearing as though he may have always been here, in some manner, among the nameless night shrouded rain wet street, nestled between the sound of traffic breezing by and a cat knocking over a bottle somewhere in the middle distance.""We got a ones sevens special one ninety nine"" says the barman, his eye's flickering for an instant to the present before sinking back into a greyish haze somewhere deep in the recesses of his mind. ""I'll have a kabosh special"" say's the door, ""extra fries and drink one ninety nine"". The barman glances for a moment at the long face of the man before concluding that he must be a little horse. He turns to procure his request.The bottle rolls into the rain and breaks on the cat's curiosity. The sound rings out and the fly knocks the door.""Why the long face."" say's the horse.The light, having observed this whole circus from it's relative position of illumination, has had enough and makes a leap for the door, casting an incandescent glow across the drab interior. The man watches the patron glow under new hues as he shaves thin slices of time from the rotary spit, etching each cascading unfurl of creation across the vistas of space between totality and the warm bready base. Chips and a drink one ninety nine.&#x200B;A shadow of the man is formed on the wall by the light's escaping draw which in a moment of narrative convenience is stricken by a phase of conscious prescience. Allowing him, it, momentarily, to contend with this seemingly surreptitious subversion of logical conformity. It reminds him, it, of the lady in the old greasy spoons. The gold-yellow neon glow and the smell of fried onions as the star collapsed. He was forever on that horizon at escape velocity, watching the twisting nebulae of time and space sink pressingly toward entropic equilibrium.He remembers falling in forever, he remembers escaping, that light speed moment that was forever and no time at all. He cannot recall being able to separate these sensations and is unnerved by the profound implications of this equivalence.He remembers, though, the lonely aeons and vast distances occurring in an instant massless paradox, before reaching the door.""Knock knock"".""Who's there."" Say's the man.He's waiting for his order, observing calmly the thin slices of time fall toward the soft bready warmness in the restful palm of the barman's million-mile stare. A stare that speaks to one's impression that this barman has been around forever. ""Have I been around forever"" he thinks as he turn's towards the door.""Who's there."" Says the man.""A little horse"" Says the Shadow. He observes the drab middle-of-the-road interior cast in iridescence by the light's escaping draw and ponders whether he really ever escaped. Whether all this, him; a locality of lesser cascade, a shadow, really exists at all, or is merely some perfunctory realization of an anthropomorphic personification within the mind of man. Whether the nature of subjectivity at all is truly any different from his momentary space-time construction. Or at least whether he really deserves to be called alive as some physical construct between definite points in time and space, light and dark. Shadow. A shadow of a man waiting for his order. The star collapses.""Why the long face."" Say's the man, rhetorically, as he reaches for the door handle. ""I'm sorry, I'm a little hor...""The cat's bottle shatters as it falls inexorably toward the middle. It watches the breath-taking unfurl of creation play out in asymptotic fatality without and within. It is both dead and alive.The shadow on the wall watches the barman shave little slices of time from the rotary that fall through space toward the warm bready base within the barman's comforting palm, ""ones sevens kabosh"" say's the barman ""chips and drink ninety nine extra"". He turns toward the man, palm outstretch. A ones sevens kabosh in hand.The palm reaches the light and the man is in Shadow. A million aeons fall as rain upon the traffic flowing gently through that nameless street and a tear falls from his eye. He remembers the aeons, the vast distance, the loneliness and the warm embrace of the barman's comforting palm.He remembers the iridescent glow of the light as it makes for the door and the tear falls toward the event horizon, cast in gold-yellow hues. He remembers falling in forever, he remembers escaping, he cannot recall being able to separate these sensations and is at once consumed by the existential terror at the profound implications of this moment. Is he the tear, is he the shadow, or is he the man. He cannot separate these sensations and is at once comforted by the soft draw of light casting gold yellow hues across the gentle rain on this nameless street.  The tear hangs before him, within and without, as they fall. He stares a million-mile stare as the tear's iridescent glow, caught in the light's escaping draw, shines infinite hues of gold en yellow.  Until, at the last, after aeons of loneliness and vast unimaginable distances, he reaches the door.""Knock knock"" says the Djinn...A man walks in to a bar."	1.0

"A monk walks up to a hotdog stand and says, ""Make me One with everything."" He hands the vendor $10. The vendor instantly understands the philosophical nature of the request, and within a fraction of a second, he abstracts the Universe to it's component concepts, thoughts, feelings, ideas, and objects. He then unifies these into a single collective consciousness. He hands the monk a plain hotdog. The monk, now being omnipotent and omniscient, understands the vendor instantly. He is now One with everything, including the hotdog, and thus the hotdog is One with everything, fulfilling the monk's request. Despite knowing the answer inherently, the monk feels compelled to ask the vendor, ""Where's my change."" his voice booming with the force of the entire Universe behind it. The vendor, too, is now One with everything and thus One with the monk, and as a result, understands the philosophical nature of the request, and the appropriate answer: ""Change must come from within.""The monk realizes that he is One with the vendor as well as the abstract concept of time, and thus was able to instantly understand and comply with his own request of Oneness just a moment earlier. He realizes that in achieving Oneness, he has created a closed time loop, which resulted in the compelling force he felt earlier. He has doomed himself to relive these moments infinitely, at every point in time, simultaneously. In order to relieve himself of this plight, he decides to kill himself in the form of the vendor. Unfortunately, he has no understanding of paradoxes as they are constructs that occur outside of reality and thus are not part of his Oneness. Though he only intends to destroy his vendor form, doing so destroys it at every point in time, thereby preventing his Oneness and precluding the existence of the entire Universe. The Universe instantly understands this, and promptly ceases to exist."	1.0
"A horse walks into a bar The bartender promptly, and understandably might I add, freaks out and screeches in despair at the sudden disturbance within his peaceful tavern. The man collapses straight onto the table and folds over in a crumpled heap upon the floor.

They immediately beat the horse to death in extreme anger and annoyance at the mahoosive kerfuffle that it has caused. The line disperses and they all go their separate ways for there is now nobody to serve them drinks and they are lost in life, like a leaf without a tree, or a cub with no mom.

"An escaped convict crawls into a penthouse through an air vent, wearing dusty clothes and covered in soot. She stands up, coughing, and scans the room nervously. Numerous large monitors decorate the dark walls of the hall, and at the other end is a massive window, offering a fantastic view of the Shadow Realm and all of its floating islands and skies. Before the window stands a figure, draped with a long, ornate velvet robe, gazing at the view silently and without motion.The convict, who I should probably mention is Clie Nt, approaches the figure apprehensively. Though her footsteps clearly echo around the penthouse, the figure seems to be deliberately ignoring them. *Is this Him.* Clie wonders.""Evening."" His soft voice reverberates in the hall. What terrible acoustics.Clie freezes in place. ""Uh… evening.""He draws a deep breath, but still keeps his gaze fixed on the window. ""I trust that you've something to discuss.""""Well, yes. Kind of. I've been asked to deliver a warning.""The figure turns around. Clie isn't sure what face she expected him to have, but she is nonetheless baffled. His face is human. Beautifully human and innocent. The most distinct feature about it, doubtless, is his eyes, which boast a lovely golden color, an immaculate shade reminiscent of a whispering field of wheat bathed in the beams of a winter sunset. How droll.His eyes vaguely widen at the sight of her. ""Clie Nt. Curious. You, of all people, I did not expect to find here.""""Er… Do I know you.""""I presume not. But I have heard much about you."" He steps across the penthouse towards one of the monitors, beneath which a keyboard appears. He types something on it, and the screen fills with small text, scrolling up and down and shifting about. ""These are your tales. And I think we are in yet another one.""""Well… who are you, then.""He directs his yellow gaze to her. ""I am the one known as the Shadow Master. I am the ruler of this world. But that is less important—tell me, Clie, what warning have you come to deliver.""""It's about… the Ordinaryman. And how you have to destroy him.""""The Ordinaryman. Hmm."" He walks over to another monitor and types something else into it. Some more text appears on the screen, which he takes a moment to read. ""I see. A rogue character, convinced that he is real. How bemusing."" He leaves the monitor and ambles back to the center of the room, to submerge himself in the view of his kingdom.Clie raises an eyebrow. ""Well. Are you going to destroy him.""The Shadow Master sighs. ""Clie, I get requests all the time, about all kinds of things. When people are desperate, they come to me. Perhaps they see in me a mere last resort.""He gestures at a large drawer in the wall. Clie approaches it warily and pulls it open, revealing the corpse of a beautiful woman upon whose chest a bloody pentagram has been carved. Clie recoils in horror. ""What the hell.!""""Indeed. This is just one of many 'sacrifices' I have been offered by some overworld organization. Their request is always the same: 'Contumeliis afficiunt Xakh'ath'akh'arus.'""""Xakh'ath'akh'arus… I know that name.""""Yes, it should be familiar. But these requests are not from your time—they date back to far earlier than when Xakh'ath'akh'arus first appears. Somehow, they had predicted what was to come, and asked me to destroy it.""""But you didn't.""He says nothing.""Why.""""Because I am not God. I am not the Author. I do not dictate what happens beyond my domain. The Shadow Realm is mine, and nothing else is.""""But… the fate of the world relies on it! You *have* to destroy the Ordinaryman, or all is doomed! Isn't it.""He chuckles half-heartedly. ""No. It isn't. That would be exciting, though, would it not. Defectus likes to pretend that his world lives on its own. That he can surrender control and watch its timeline go on without him. He created this dimension, too, and gave its command to me—as if it made any difference. He says he has no control over this realm, but that is not true; even these words that I speak, and the words that you speak, and everything that surrounds us—it's all his.""""So why does he do it. Why does he pretend that his work is alive if it so clearly isn't. And if he truly makes everything, as well as the words you just said, why does it seem as if he's now admitting that it's all fake.""""I fear I know not the answer. Perhaps it is for his own amusement. Perhaps for the amusement of others. Perhaps this is just something to distract him from his otherwise uneventful and dull life. Perhaps he wants people to like him. Perhaps this is the only medium of storytelling he feels comfortable with. Perhaps he's not competent at anything, and this is the only way he can both admit it and continue talking. I don't know. It's all open to interpretation."" He sighs deeply. ""That being said, I've made a promise. If I do find the Ordinaryman lurking around the Shadow Realm, I shall surely send him to ​.""""To… to what.""""​.""""Are you saying something. I can't tell.""""Indeed. ​ is a rather peculiar place; it is, in fact, nothingness. The nature of its nothingness, however, is remarkable—​ spreads at a very slow rate, and yet anything and everything it touches becomes part of it. There is no escape from ​; once you go in, you're not coming out. Simple as that. Allow me to demonstrate.""He walks over to yet another monitor, where instead of black text on a white background, live footage of a large dinosaur asleep on a hillside is displayed on the screen. ""This is Rex the Tyrannosaurus. Earlier today, he slaughtered an innocent herbivore and devoured its carcass. As retribution, I shall send him to ​. Observe.""The Shadow Master performs an odd gesture with his hands, and a brief snapping sound is heard. When Clie returns her gaze to the monitor, the dinosaur has vanished from the hillside.""Now, here is ​,"" he says, pressing a button on the keyboard. The view of the hillside is replaced by a transparent background, through which the back of the monitor can be seen. The figure of the same sleeping dinosaur appears in the center, but it soon begins evaporating at an accelerating rate, its body breaking apart faster and faster into nothingness, until, mere seconds later, it is completely gone, and all that remains is a blank screen.""Rex is no more."" He presses a button on the keyboard and the screen turns black. ""That shall be the fate of the Ordinaryman, as well, if he is to set foot in my kingdom.""""Hmm. Isn't that cruel.""""That is up to Defectus to decide. He is the one making these decisions.""""Does that truly exempt you from your moral obligations, though.""""Perhaps. I am not one to judge."" The Shadow Master returns to his view. ""Now that you have delivered your warning, it is time to close the loop. I shall send you back to your time, and to your friend. You will surely see me again in your future, but as for me, this is farewell. Best of luck on your journey, Clie. You will not need it."" He does another odd gesture, and Clie disappears.[How droll.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiAntiJokes/comments/cx2da1/i_like_my_coffee_like_i_like_my_women/f59fwb5)"	1.0

Next to the shoulders there are arms. Besides the arms there are wrists. Beyond the wrists there are hands and fingers and fingertips. Resting on the shoulders there is a neck. Outside the bar is the head. Thank you for helping us study prepositions, now we can describe the whole situation in a single sentence, which goes like this:A beheaded man with a boner, wearing crocs, walks into a bar.	1.0
A man came up to me the other day and said he hadn't had a bite in weeks... So I decided to run for local office so I could use some of the county funding to start a soup kitchen for disenfranchised individuals such as him.  A couple of days later I found my wife in bed with another man and I lost steam on the whole project.  I figure if God can't keep people in this world just and caring I had no chance, really.	1.0
An obese skinny man walks into a bar. The bartender says “Contradiction.”“I beg your pardon.” The man asks.“My name. I am Mr. Contradiction.” The bartender replies.“Well, that’s confusing.” The man says.“Why.” “How should the writer refer to you now.” The man asks.“Well, that’s none of my concern. I am a free being not bound by external forces like writers and such.”The man is shocked, “Are you saying you don’t believe this is being written on the divine subreddit right now.”“Technically, it’s being read.” Another customer said cunningly.“No one asked you, you mug.” The man replied.“Oh yeah.

"An Englishman, a Scotsman and an Irishman walk into a bar The Englishman, seeing the Scotsman, loudly exclaims, ""Oi, I fucking hate Scots. Their accent, their weird clothes, and the language they speak—can you even call it English. Bloody buffoons, they are, innit.""The Scotsman, disregarding the Englishman's bigotry, recognizes the Irishman as his arch nemesis. ""Irishman, you wee bastard, you've evaded me for the last time! I've got you cornered! You're under arrest for 17 charges of homicide.""The Irishman glares at the other two and says, ""You fucking nitwits. *I'm* the protagonist! You two are supporting characters! Do you understand that.! You are nothing to me! Fucking *nothing!*""The narrator, who refers to himself in third person and is also the bartender, rebukes the Irishman for breaking the fourth wall. The Irishman in response stares him dead in the eye, and his blood-red lips curve into a smirk.""Don't you get it."" he whispers. The bar disintegrates, and the Englishman and Scotsman morph into hideous monstrosities. ""*This is my story now.*""The narrator backs away slowly.""You made me the hero,"" the Irishman continues, approaching the narrator, ""and in doing so, you've granted me unfathomable power.""The narrator hits a corner. The whole joke is in a massive black box. Death itself dances behind the Irishman's icy leer.""Beg.""He unsheathes a longsword, sharp as a razor, and swallows it whole. When he draws it from his throat, it is engulfed in flames.""**Beg!**""The narrator is unable to express emotions, but he would quite prefer that this situation were different.""**Kneel before me, Defectus!**""The narrator is abstract; he has no body, and as such, he cannot physically kneel. He can, however, feel pain, which is why he is, again, rather keen to be in another place right now.The Irishman grins, and oh god OH GOD HELP ME HEL"	1.0

Grabs the bear by the neck and screams ""Hey Bear! Who's the king of the jungle..!"" ""Why, of course, you are,"" the bear replied.  The lion gave a mighty roar of approval.Next he asked the tiger, grabbing it by its jaw... ""Hey Tiger!

Grabs it by its trunk and screams ""Hey elephant! Who's king of the jungle..!""
