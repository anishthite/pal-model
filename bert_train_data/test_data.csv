"What's overly long and kinda stupid and weird and odd? Yo ~~mama~~ guys, I know I haven't posted here in a while. I haven't had much time to write much of anything recently, and I'm hoping I can restart that passion soon, since I remember I had a lot of fun making antiantijokes.

Earlier this year, I wrote an antiantijoke-like short story, revolving around 20 ""jokes"" that start off fairly normal but gradually progress into absurdist existential horror. I called it ""Twenty Jokes That'll Make You Go 'Karblowza!',"" and it was originally meant to be published in physical form with illustrations, but that idea never came to fruition. I read it again recently and was wondering if you guys would be interested in reading it too.

I know this isn't a typical r/AntiAntiJokes post but I just wanna make sure I'm not posting unwanted material here.

Turned out it wasn’t Mickey Mouse it was just a regular mouse and it wasn’t Garfield the cat it was just a regular cat. None of the crap about Disney World was real. This isn’t a fairy tail...

"Why can't the mosquito climb a wall? Said the prosecutor. ""Why can't YOU climb a wall?"" Said the defense attorney. ""My guy over here will NOT be harassed by such statements like that."" The mosquito was indeed offended that a gentleman like the prosecutor could stoop that low. The prosecutor indeed stooped that low. His saggy balls, saggy balls of a gentleman, the saggy balls smothered the floor. Ungentlemanlike. ""He's flexing, judge! Don't let him flex like that!"" shouted the Defense Attorney. ""Objection!"" said the plaintiff. ""Gentlemen can do whatever they want!"" The mosquito clapped back. ""But a mosquito can't climb a wall? I'll fucking suck the blood out of your bald dome you eggman.""The judge bribed in favor of the bald plaintiff was unexpectedly astounded by the sexual prowess displayed by the mosquito . This was real love in first sight. This was indeed real love in first sight, the prosecutor also saw the sexual prowess of the mosquito. We got a love triangle here folks! ""umm excuse me? Prosecutor? Isn't that a slur to bald people?"" asked the ugly plaintiff. ""Haha suck a dick you miserable cueball. Oh wait, you don't even have teeth!"" giggled the Prosecutor. ""But the mosquito also doesn't have teeth. "" Said the Defense Attorney who was now acting like a Devil's Advocate. ""Are you acting like the Devil's Advocate? Trick question, you can't because you ARE the Devil."" said the mosquito while getting its proboscis licked by the judge. ""Am I the Devil?"" this was a question that haunted the Devil throughout the whole proceeding. ""Why don't you defend me devil, I'll shave my bush for you"" parlayed the plaintiff, losing both his prosecutor and his teeth. ""Ok. "" acquiesced the Devil. ""Hey guys, don't leave me out of the fun!"" asked the prosecutor readying for the threesome. ""Quick, Call me Judge Judy, cause it helps me cum more than once"" exclaimed the mosquito while reaching the rare power climax. ""I—I just cant. The prosecutor just weirds me out. I do want to call you judge judy, in fact I can say judge judy 10 times, but the prosecutor looks like the walrus."" puked the judge. ""Oh you choosy bitch. You choosy bitch of a clit. Your imaginary clit smothered the floor. Look what you've done."" gentlemaned the prosecutor. ""Why don't we get the bailiff and start a threesome of our own?"" argued the bald sentient sexdoll. ""Semolina"" Pilchared the Devil. ""As long as I get to know how many vaginas the Devil has."" inquired the Bailiff. ""Six, it's in Dante's Inferno. Dipshit."" said the Devil. Edgar Allan Poe. ""WOW, the foul language out of you, gorgeous."" pranced the mosquito from the other pews. ""Suck me more you fucking hairless smegma. I revel on being able to pick up your face like it's a basketball."" whispered gleefully the bailiff. ""Why don't you try me, woman?"" Crabalocker? More like Grab a cocker!

"Why did the rooster cross the road? ""Answer me, damnit! Why did the rooster cross the road?!"" Jerry Seinfeld yells.The East European terrorist smirks and replies: ""To fack your mader, that heppened to be working her usual side of the road thet night.""Jerry further loses his temper and lands a few punches at the terrorist's face. The terrorist stares blankly at Jerry and says: ""Did a little kitten just kiss me? The fack was thet?""Jerry tries again: ""I'm asking the questions here! Why did the rooster cross the road!?""The terrorist answers: ""To gather his rooster comrades so they could take your mader to motel and hef intercourse. It was a 3 for 2 Saturday special discount, how could they decline such an affer?""Jerry punches the terrorist in the cheek repeatedly, to which the terrorist then remarks:""You hit like little taddler with cerebral parese, put more weight into your right foot and maybe you hit more like 8th grader next time.""""Shut up! Why did the rooster cross the road!?"" Jerry asks again, this time forming a tear in his eye. Jerry punches the terrorist a couple more times afterwards until he has seemingly had enough.The terrorist says, now raising his voice: ""Oof! Okay, okay. Stap! I'll cooperate...to arrive at the drop-off point and retrieve the peckege.""Jerry widens his eyes in anticipation now that he has finally managed to break down the terrorist. He eagerly turns around and yells towards a locked door behind him: ""This guy is about to talk! Get in here, sir!""He redirects his attention at the terrorist as another man that's wearing a suit unlocks the door and walks into the interrogation room. Jerry continues: ""Yeah? Well, go on! What was inside the package?! Where was the drop-off point?! Where is the package now?!""The terrorist asks: ""Can I hef pen and paper? I will draw mep of location of peckege. I don't know whet is inside. I just follow directions, no questions asked. The rooster knows.""The suited man, who acts as Jerry's handler gives a subtle nod to Jerry. Jerry produces a pen and a notebook from the breast pocket of his shirt. They uncuff the terrorist and allow him to draw a map.Jerry shows the map to his handler to which the handler says:""Excellent! Good job, kid! Go outside and wait for the chopper. I'm calling it in now. A tactical team will be joining you."" Jerry rushes outside the CIA's headquarters in Langley. He is eventually picked up by a helicopter that is occupied by a heavily armed tactical unit.They fly for almost two hours and land near their destination. The tactical team disembark the helicopter alongside Jerry and they close in on a motel that was marked on the hand drawn map. The map also depicts the room number of their target. Upon arriving they discreetly evacuate the motel's lobby, quickly retrieve information about the targeted room and its occupants and stack up at the room's door.This is it. The case Jerry has been working on for months is starting to near a conclusion, or so Jerry thinks as the team breach the door and throw a stinger grenade into the room. As they enter, their field of vision is obscured by feathers slowly descending to the floor. They see several dead roosters, severed beaks, limbs, blood splatter and Jerry Seinfeld's disheveled mother lying on the bed. She is covered in a blanket and has a confused expression on her face.All the roosters have died from the stinger grenade's detonation, except one of them. The surviving rooster emerges from underneath Jerry's mother's blanket and stares angrily at Jerry. It abruptly tries to exit the room by running in-between the men's feet in order to reach the doorway but is pushed back by the light thrust of a team member's foot. The rooster then exclaims:""God fucking damnit, you guys are such cockblocks!""",1

"I met a girl at a bar and asked her ""what's your sign?"" ""Cancer,"" she said, a tear drop forming in her eye. ""I have a year left to live.""The next few months were like a whirlwind. I promised her I would make every last moment of her life count. I quit my job, sold my house, car, and everything I owned. We drove across the country in a beat-up 95 Accord.She grew up near the equator and lived the south. She'd never seen snow before. I took her up north. We saw the Northern Lights. We went down the coast. We got scuba licenses, dove with turtles, had a pet shark. We learned how to surf. We learned tango. We learned how to cook in Thailand. We got married one night in Jamaica. Ran away from the police in Morocco. Spent a week with the mafia in Moscow. Ran a racket for a few days in Tel Aviv. Nearly drowned in Rio.The sex was fantastic, although some days we got kind of rough, and if a hair fell out, she would shed a single tear before we got back at it. She wanted me to choke her, she wanted to bite me. And after we finished, she would get this twinkle in her eye. She would grin, then purse her lips back, like she was ready to say something but just couldn't get it off her tongue.She wanted to be a mother. At the 6-month mark we adopted a 17-year old. She always said she wanted someone to know love, someone who had never experienced it in her life. It didn't matter if she couldn't be around, so long as her son knew he would be loved.We went drinking at the bar we met, right on our one-year aniversary. The doctor advised against it, but we just shrugged. Nothing to lose. She had a double margarita, I had a whiskey on the rocks. Not even two drinks in, she had to go the bathroom. I thought she would never stop vomiting. She looked so weak in that moment, so vulnerable.Eventually there came a knock at the door. Our time was coming to a close. We picked a peaceful hospice, somewhere with a nice ocean view. I held her hand on the last day. She got a twinkle in her eye, grinned, and then pursed her lips back, like she was ready to say something but just couldn't get it off her tongue. She weakly gestured at me and I leaned in close. She pulled over to my ear and whispered her last words:""Dead end.""",1

Once at the House, the plan will be reviewed, edited and voted upon by the Second Prefects in the House.

If the First Prefects are pleased, the plan will be voted upon (at least 91% in favour) and sent to the Donetsk Circle. At the Donetsk Circle, the High Prefects will form a committee who will then review the plan, edit it, hold discussions and then submit it to the Lower Donetsk Circle for review. Ministers in the Lower Donetsk Circle will then review it, attach recommendations and concerns to the plan and vote on the plan (at least 74% in favour) and then send it back to the Donetsk Circle (known as the Upper Donetsk Circle). The High Prefects will then review the plan, review the recommendations and concerns (which are not binding) and then vote on the plan (at least 93% in favour).

This is because all odd numbers can be represented as such:2n+1 = n² + 2n + 1 - n² = (n+1)² - n²and all numbers divisible by 4 can be represented as such:4n = n² + 2n + 1 - (n² - 2n + 1) = (n+1)² - (n-1)²The remaining numbers seem to be somewhat arbitrarily scattered—the number 2 is the difference between 3³ and 5² (27 - 25 = 2), and the number 10 is the difference between 13³ and 3⁷ (2,197 - 2,187 = 10), but the number 6, for instance, is seemingly missing this property, as is 14, 34, 42, 50, and the rest.This, of course, is merely a conjectured list; there has been no formal proof that any of these numbers are not, in fact, the difference between two perfect powers.There have been extensive searches for such powers—according to the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), these numbers are not the difference between two perfect powers below 2⁶⁴ (around 1.8×10¹⁹), however this is not concrete proof that such differences do not exist, and we can't be sure of this either. It's very possible that these differences do exist, but that they are between two massive perfect powers that we simply haven't discovered yet. There are some numbers which take a very long time to knock off the list, simply because they are differences of gigantic powers—for example, the number 7,202 is the difference between 9,603³ and 941,405² (885,565,699,227 - 885,565,692,025 = 7,202).There are certain rules that can help optimize the search for these numbers: for starters, since we're only looking for even differences not divisible by 4, we can ignore powers of even bases, since any even base raised to any power will immediately become divisible by 4 (2×2=4). Another rule is that for natural numbers numbers a, b, n and m, the expression:(2a+1)ⁿ - (2b+1)ᵐwill be divisible by 4 if and only if a×n + b×m is even.Using these optimizations, I designed [this webpage](https://newdefectus.github.io/PowerGaps/) where you can fiddle with an algorithm that searches for these so-called ""power gaps."" If you've got any more optimizations to add, I'd be very happy to hear them.",1

I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks.. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence. The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is..So, as the couple passes, he says to them, 'Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?'Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply, 'Fifty years ago that wasn't an electric fence.''",1

"My Father's Favorite Joke (maybe NSFW?) So, An American Man, A German Man, and a Polack are in a hotel... and they're horny but strapped for cash, so they can't buy a prostitute. They can, however, buy a blow-up doll. The American drives to the store and picks one up, and heads back to the hotel. Since the American bought it, he gets to try her out first. He does his thing, comes out of his room 15 minutes later and says ""that was actually pretty good for 5 bucks.."" The German hears that as good news and takes her into his room. He comes out 30 minutes later and says ""nothing like the girls of my country.. but she knows how to bend"". The Polack cannot take anymore tension and takes the girl into his room. He comes out in 10 seconds, and the German and American ask him how his experience was. The Polack looks at them in fear, and says; ""I don't know what happened,"" shaking his head. ""I bit her on the tit, she farted, and flew out the window.""My dad apparently heard that joke in 7th grade, and still laughs for about 5 minutes every time he says it.",1

"Do you fart in bed ? This is a story about a couple who had been happily married for years, the only friction in their marriage was the husband’s habit of farting loudly every morning when he awoke. The noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air.Every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn't stop it and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor, she was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out. The years went by and he continued to rip them out. Then one Christmas day morning, as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the innards, neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts, and a malicious thought came to her. She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling the bed covers back, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts. Sometime later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bath room. The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good. About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of horror on his face. She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said, “Honey you were right… all these years you have warned me and I didn't listen to you.” “What do you mean?” asked his wife. “Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened, but by the grace of god, some Vaseline and two fingers. I think I got most of them back in !!!”",1

"Have you heard about Terry the tractor lover? He was the ultimate tractor enthusiast, his bedroom was plastered with tractor posters, his bed was adorned with a tractor bed spread, tractor toys littered the floor and tractor maintenance DVDs dominated his shelves. Shortly after Terry's 18th birthday (where he of course had a tractor birthday cake and received numerous tractor themed gifts)  Terry's life turned on it's head. An old farmer, a tractor driver and hero of Terry's stopped him in the street and said ""Isn't it about time you grew up a bit lad and stopped wasting your life obsessing over tractors?"" Terry had developed a thick skin over the years when it came to ignoring the haters but he knew that this man was no hater, he was a tractor lover and had Terry's best interests at heart. After a couple of days of deep thought and soul searching Terry made his decision. The posters were ripped down, the bed spread put on ebay, the toys sent to a local charity shop. It was done. He was now a man.Somewhat perplexed by his sudden lack of tractor entertainment options Terry decided to visit a pub for the first time. He wandered in, ordered a pint and took up residence in the corner of the pub.Shortly after arriving Terry noticed a bit of commotion over by the bar *note this was in the days before the smoking ban*. A towel left too close to the ashtray had caught fire on a cigarette ember. Smoke rapidly began to fill the room and despite the bar staff successfully extinguishing the fire and wafting vigorously they were soon left with no option but to order everyone out of the bar.Just as people began to leave Terry stood up. ""wait"" he shouted, everyone watched as he ran over to where the smoke was the thickest and took in a huge breath inhaling all the smoke! He then ran to the window, opened it and blew all the smoke outside before returning to his original seat.""Incredible"", ""unbelievable"", ""how on earth did you do that!?"" came the cries.""Well"" explained Terry ""you see I'm an ex-tractor-fan""",1

A few hundred years after they've been put in place, an angel flutters down to them.A wave of his hand, and suddenly the statues have been given flesh, and they step down from their pedestals.The angel says, ""I have been sent to grant the mutual request you both have made after hundreds of years of standing across from each other, unable to move. But be quick--you only have fifteen minutes until you must become statues again.""The man looks at the woman, and they both flush, and giggle, and run off into some underbrush. An intense rustling comes from the bushes, and seven minutes later, they both come back to the angel, obviously satisfied.The angel smiles at the couple. ""That was only seven minutes--why not go back and do it again?""The former statues look at each other for a minute, and then the woman says, ""Why not? But let's reverse it this time--you hold down the pigeon, and I'll shit on it....""",1

"...How did you do it? There was once a train operator who had been driving trains for well over 20 years. Over the course of his career, he had experienced a number of close calls in the accident department. At long last, sadly, he hit a schoolbus full of children on its way out of the elementary school parking lot, killing every single one of them.Unsurprisingly, he was put on trial for a number of counts of manslaughter in the first degree. After several hours of deliberation, he was convicted and the judge sentenced him to death by means of the electric chair. For his last meal, the unskilled train driver requested his grandmother's homemade macaroni and cheese. The warden of his temporarily assigned prison was hesitant at first, but eventually agreed that it was the least he could do for the man who was going to die in a few hours.After scarfing down his grandmother's meal and saying his goodbyes, the man was brought to the electric chair. The executioner strapped him in and threw the switch. Three times they tried to electrocute the man. Three times it failed. Not knowing what to do, the befuddled executioner unstrapped him and led him out of the room to attempt a different means of execution.On the way out, the veteran guard at the door insisted on asking the man how he had possibly survived the electric chair. In all his years of working, he had never seen a single person survive such a fate. He asked: ""How'd you do it, man? Was it your grandmother's macaroni? Are you some sort of messiah? What's your secret?""The man shrugged his shoulders, scratched his head, and thought for a moment. Finally, he replied:""No secret. I suppose I'm just a bad conductor, that's all.""",1

"What is government? asked little Johnny from his father. A teacher was teaching her second grade class about the government, so for homework she told her students to ask their parents what the government is. When Little Johnny got home that day, he went up to his dad and ask his what the government was. His dad thought for a while and answered, ""Look at it this way: I'm the president, your mom is Congress, your maid is the work force, you are the people and your baby brother is the future."" ""I still don't get it"" responded the Little Johnny. ""Why don't you sleep on it then? Maybe you'll understand it better,"" said the dad. ""Okay then...good night"" said Little Jonny went off to bed.  In the middle of the night, Little Johnny was awakened by his baby brother's crying.  He went to his baby brother's crib and found that his baby brother had taken a crap in his diaper.  So Little Johnny went to his parent's room to get help.  When he got to his parent's bedroom, he looked through the keyhole to check if his parents were asleep.  Through the keyhole he saw his mom loudly snoring, buthis dad wasn't there.  So he went to the maid's room.  When he looked through the maid's room keyhole, he saw his dad having sex with his maid.  Little Johnny was surprised, but then he just realized something and thinks aloud,  ""OH!! Now I understand the government! The President is screwing the work force, Congress is fast asleep, nobody cares about the people, and the future is full of shit!""",1

Lots of hands go up, but Little Johnny has his up first.  *If I call on Johnny,* the teacher thinks, *he'll just say asshole.*""Suzy?""""Apple!""""Excellent, Suzy!  Now,"" she continues, ""Who knows a word that starts with B?""  Again, lots of hands, but Johnny is quickest, and he's really excited about his word.  *Johnny's word is 'bitch', I just know it,* thinks the teacher.""Billy?""""Bacon!""""Terrific Billy,"" says the teacher, making a note to ask Billy's parents if he's been spending too much time on Reddit.Down the alphabet she goes, and with every letter she asks, Johnny's hand shoots up, and he's getting more and more anxious to be called on.  For every letter, the teacher can think of something that little Johnny would say. Finally, she gets to the letter R.  She can't think of anything naughty that Johnny might say.  By now Johnny is beside himself, raising his hand, making little ""Me, Me!"" noises.""Alright Johnny,"" she says, ""Go ahead.  What's your word that starts with R?""""A Rat!"" Johnny replies, holding his hands out, ""A big fuckin' rat with a dick this fuckin' long!""",1

"My two favorite jokes, can you help my delivery? I mean my real life delivery.  I just want a couple of killer jokes I can tell at a party or meeting new people.Little Johnny grew up with his father and every spring would help his father till the soil to plant tomatoes.  Little Johnny eventually grew up to be Big Johnny and Big Johnny fell in with the wrong crowd.  He got arrested after a bank robbery and was locked up.  The next spring came around and Johnny's father had to till the soil alone, but he was an old man and called his son to talk about his problems.  The next day the father was woken up by sirens and big SUVs.  Dozens of cops and FBI agents ran into his garden with shovels and started digging like mad men.  After five hours they apologized, got into their cars, and left a confused man.  He called Johnny in jail to talk about what happened and Johnny apologized,'I'm sorry I couldn't help you with the garden this year so I told the police I buried the robbery money in your garden.'-----------An Irishman walked into his local pub and order three pints of Guinness and three shots of whiskey.  He drank a shot, sipped his beer, drank the second shot, sipped the second beer, drank the third shot, sipped the third beer, paid his tab and left.  He repeated this every Monday for months.  One day the bartender asked why he had to order everything all at once.'I have two brothers.  One moved to America, one moved to Australia.  Every Monday we agreed to go out and order three whiskeys and three pints so we always think of each other.'Touched, the bartender smiled and let the man have today's drinks on the house.  Two months later the man arrives at the bar and only orders two whiskeys and two pints.'I'm sorry to intrude,' the bartender said. 'Did something happen to one of your brothers?  I've very sorry for your loss.''My brothers?  No, they're fine.  I just quit drinking.'-----------Is there anything I can do, pacing, stress, intonation, facial expressions, hand gestures, whatever to deliver these two jokes like a pro?

"Are Computers Male or Female? As you are aware, ships have long been characterized as being female (e.g., ""Steady as she goes"" or ""She's listing to starboard, Captain!"") Recently, a group of computer scientists (all males) announced that computers should also be referred to as being female. Their reasons for drawing this conclusion follow: Five reasons to believe computers are female:1. No one but the Creator understands their internal logic.2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else.3. The message ""Bad command or file name"" is about as informative as, ""If you don't know why I'm mad at you, then I'm certainly not going to tell you.""4. Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later retrieval.5. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck on accessories for it.However, another group of computer scientists, (all female) think that computers should be referred to as if they were male. Their reasons follow:Five reasons to believe computers are male: 1. They have a lot of data, but are still clueless.2. They are supposed to help you solve problems, but half the time they ARE the problem.3. As soon as you commit to one you realize that, if you had waited a little longer, you could have obtained a better model.4. In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on.5.

During the interview the normal questions are asked like what qualifications he has, his flaws, etc... Then the CEO asks Dave, ""Give me one solid reason why I should hire you."" to which Dave replies, ""I literally know everybody."" The CEO looking confused says, ""What do you mean literally everybody?"" Dave explains to the CEO that he literally knows everybody and encourages the CEO to name any one person and he promises he knows them.""I bet you dont know Tom Cruise"", says the CEO""Tom!? Oh hell yeah! We took a few acting classes together back in college, great guy.""""Bullshit!"" the CEO replies, ""Im getting us flight right know and we are going to go visit him.""So Dave and the CEO get on a plane and head out west to find Tom Cruise's home. After some searching they find it and go to knock on the door. To the CEO's surprise Tom answers the door and the first thing out of his mouth is, ""DAVE! Oh man, I havent seen you in ages, come on in and share a drink with me!"" After a few hours of shooting the shit and pounding some brews the CEO and Dave decide its time to leave. On the way to the airport the CEO tells Dave, ""Ok, so im still not convinced, I mean, small world right? You couldnt possibly know Tom Cruise AND the president!"" Dave smirks and says, ""Would you like to go find out?""The CEO immediately buys plane tickets to go to D.C. to see if Dave is full of shit or not. The two manage to get on a tour of the White House when out of no where the CEO hears somebody yelling, ""Dave! Hey! Dave! So good to see you! Ive got a lot of meetings today but lets get a cup of coffee real quick!"" The CEO turns around to find that the president is the one yelling at Dave. Stunned and almost convinced that Dave literally knows everybody, the CEO says, ""Ok, mister, Tom Cruise and the president, thats impressive, but I highly doubt you know the Pope!"" Dave then recalls stories of his parents growing up in a small town with the Pope. The CEO ready to finally call Dave out fronts the bill for tickets to the Vatican to try and meet the Pope. As they stand in the crowd of thousands and thousands of people waiting to be blessed by the Pope, Dave tells the CEO, ""Im going to try to get us a better view."" Dave makes his way past a few guards and up some stairs and the next thing you know he's walking out next to the Pope.Dave returns to find the CEO is having a heart attack. Dave asks what happened and the CEO replies,""I was blown away by the fact you knew the Pope but what really got me was the guy behind me who said, 'Hey! Who is that asshole with Dave?'""",1

You see them and they make you cry.” This infuriated his wife and daughter. The daughter asks, “Mom, how many different kinds of willies are there?” The mother smiles and says, “Well, dear, a man goes through three phases also. In his 20s, his willy is like an oak tree, mighty and hard. In his 30s and 40s, it’s like a birch, flexible but reliable. After his 50s, it’s like a Christmas tree.” “A Christmas tree?” the daughter asks. “Yes, dead from the root up and the balls are just for decoration.”",1

"Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)? Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or some variant.One student, however, wrote the following:First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave.Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell.With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially.Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added. This gives two possibilities:1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.So which is it?If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa during my Freshman year that, ""It will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you,"" and take into account the fact that I slept with her last night, then number two must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over. The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not  accepting any more souls and is therefore, extinct......leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being which explains why, last night, Teresa kept shouting ""Oh my God.""",1

The guy holding the box replies:*       ""If you buy me a liter I'll tell you."" Curious, I buy the guy a liter. The guy drinks the liter, sets the box on the bar, and opens it. I can't believe my eyes.*       Inside the box is a tiny man, wearing a tiny tuxedo and tiny white gloves, sitting on a tiny bench and playing a tiny grand piano.*       ""Wow!"" I exclaim, ""Where did you ever get such a small musician?"" The guy smiles, and replies:*       ""You wouldn't believe me if I told you.""*       ""Please tell me!"" I beg. The guy sighs, and closes the box.*       ""Okay, buy me another liter and I'll tell you,"" he replies. I buy another liter for the guy.*       ""A genie gave it to me."" He replies. Now I'm skeptical, but I have just seen a man far too small to be human playing the piano. Genies don't seem too far-fetched.*       ""Okay, Can I see the genie?""*       ""Alright, buy me one more liter and I'll let you meet the genie,"" The guy relents. I happily buy him a liter, and the guy reaches into his pocket and pulls out an old oil lamp. ""Here, rub the lamp if you want to see the genie,"" he says. I take the lamp and rub it. The bar fills with smoke, and a genie appears.*       ""You have summoned me,"" he says to me, ""so I will grant you one wish"". I'm extremely excited about this.*       ""I wish for a million bucks!"" I yell. *       ""Very well,"" replies the genie, snapping his fingers. He disappears. For a minute the bar is silent.*       Suddenly, the bar erupts into chaos. The building fills from floor to ceiling with a swarm of molting, flapping, quacking ducks. The noise is deafening, but I manage to shout to the guy next to me, still holding the box:*       ""Hey, I wished for a million bucks, not a million ducks!"" I yell over the noise. ""What happened?"" The guy sadly picks up his box and starts wading through the swarm of ducks towards the exit. He turns over his shoulder and replies:*       ""Yeah, and did you really think I wished for a nine inch pianist?""",1

"Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)? First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving, which is unlikely. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added. This gives two possibilities:1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over. So which is it? If we accept the postulate given to me by Anabella during my Freshman year that, 'It will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you,' and take into account the fact that I slept with her last night, then number two must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over. The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it isnot accepting any more souls and is therefore, extinct..... ....leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a Divine Being which explains why, last night, Anabella kept shouting 'Oh my God.'",1

"Extremely frustrated. Anyone else develop a ridiculous tolerance without smoking that much? I'm at the end of my rope here. I am an adult who has been casually smoking for a few years on and off. Probably average 2-3 grams a week. After my most recent break to pass a drug test, I started smoking and would get high as giraffe pussy within the first few hits. Couldn't finish joints.I've been smoking similar amounts, but lately my tolerance is, frankly, unbelievable. I honestly do not expect anyone here to believe me. An hour ago I smoked 4 blunts and 3 bong bowls, an entire eighth. I feel absolutely nothing, and this has been going on a while now. What the hell happened? I was smoking .3-.5 once or twice a day, and now I'm virtually impervious to weed.I see all these people on here talk about being daily smokers for years and still getting a buzz from a bowl. Are people just lying?I tried edibles, I bought a volcano just to see if vaping worked (nope), the only thing I havent tried is concentrates, which are a BITCH to find outside of the good states.Is there anything I can do besides a full on tolerance break? I really (used to) enjoy my pre-bed joint and now I'm really annoyed that I can't. I was thinking maybe if I smoke extremely small amounts, because it has the same effect for me as smoking an eighth, that my tolerance will go back down? tl;dr I feel like I'm being punished for smoking too much weed and I don't smoke anywhere near that much. I don't want to quit smoking for a few months but I might have to. Anyone have any experience with ludicrous tolerances? sorry, rant. ",1

Realising that this was the last day their son could've possibly been alive, the father had a an emotional breakdown. He went to his former wife's home, a revolver in hand. Entering her room he found her in bed with his brother, her face displaying both ecstasy and happiness. It was the first time he had seen her smile in nearly five years.

Two weeks later she attempted suicide by driving into the side of a building, killing a young boy in the process.

Check reddit and 4chan over the weekend for your surprise.""The weekend passed and Chris was distraught.

Buddy! You don't BELIEVE in me? The earth is literally gushing with joy because of this. I came through and gave you even more than was asked! Furthermore, I can't just, like... undo that! Y'know? What's going on? Why do you want this? Are your genitals okay?"" God asked.""Well, you see, God, on Friday, you quite literally crushed my car, my dream. Over the weekend, you promised you'd make it up to me. Instead, you also ended up taking my fantasies.

"Want to here a good one? My crappy childhood. Well, I didn’t have the best childhood. We lived in a pretty bad neighborhood. My parents died when I was young, murdered in a break-in in my house. Somehow I survived, the intruder for some reason didn’t kill me, although people tell me all the time that I should’ve died. I had to move in with my aunt and uncle, who were complete dicks. For some reason they never liked me, and they always favored their existing son, my asshole cousin. Basically my childhood was terrible and I didn’t have many friends because of my borderline abusive relationship with my new parents. Life sucked pretty much, and like a lot of children, I was bullied, even by my own cousin.This all changed one day when this man came to our nice vacation home (we were pretty rich), who claimed he worked at a prestigious boarding school to the north. My Aunt and Uncle were terrified of him for some reason, but he came to tell me that the school wanted me, since my parents went there and were good students. They wanted to continue the tradition of my old family. He also said I had inherited a big fortune from my biological parents. I was ecstatic, my life was finally taking a turn for the better.I arrived at my new school by train the next month, to the dismay of my Aunt and Uncle. I was joyful with glee, but overwhelmed by this sudden change in my life. The same guy who first came to our house helped me buy books and our new school uniform. I fit in at school pretty well, and immediately made two great friends. I was finally starting to have a good outlook on life, and everything at my new school was going great until that asshole Voldemort showed up and tried to kill me again. ",1

"So, as everyone knows, two different species (flavors) of cheerios cannot mate, right? That is, if one is honey-nut and another is blueberry, they cannot mate. Anyway, there is this one normal cheerio that is in love with a blueberry cheerio. Unfortunately, he cannot mate with her. He can't even communicate with her because they are of different species. So, he invents a machine that changes all of his CNA (Cheerio DNA) into whichever type of cheerio that he wants. However, this machine performs a process that is extraordinarily painful, because that sort of thing would hurt. Anyway. He does it, and the normal flavored cheerio becomes a blueberry cheerio. Unfortunately, this girl cheerio hates him so much that she invents an identical machine and does the process on herself in order to become a cinnamon-apple cheerio, just so she can avoid this creeper. So, she does it. The boy cheerio is starting to get upset at this because he really wants her. So he tells himself that he will go through the pain for her, and becomes a cinnamon-apple cheerio. She then changes to a honey-nut cheerio! He decides that this is the last time that he will change cheerio type. He does it, and she changes one more time, into a normal cheerio - the kind he originally was. So he says out loud, ""Okay, this is really the last time. If she changes again, I will just stay back with my family."" So he becomes a normal cheerio again, and she doesn't change fast enough for him to put his moves on her. So, they start dating, and he finally asks her to the Formal Bowl (ahaha, get it, bowl instead of ball). Anyway, they get there and dance intensely for a few hours. Finally, they get tired and she sends the boy cheerio to the milk bowl (you know, since it's a cereal dance, they have that and punch). He gets there and stands in line for ten minutes. Finally fed up at the really long line, he looks over at the bowl of punch and realizes there is no punch line.",1

"adoption so basically, when I was young, I was in a bunch of orphan homes and stuff. I never really had any friends or anything, and I pretty much was just waiting for when I turned 18 so I could leave. One day, one of the usual suspects comes in, but he is alone. He is a really rich dude, looking to do the weird homeschool thing in the cool mansion. I still remember the stiff cot under me when he came in. ""Hey,"" he said   ""hi,"" I said. he left immediately, and then came back later. that's all he needed, and I was adopted immediately. I was so happy. we got into his nice Mercedes, and drove off. We stopped at a nearby restaurant, which was the first meal I had had outside the orphanage in years.   ""you hungry?"" he says with his dark shades on""OMG yes I'm starving"" I reply he takes off his shades to reveal a tear in his eye""Hi starving, I'm dad""",1

"A horse walks into the transfinite continuum and sees a bar up ahead. The horse walks into the bar and sees a shadow serving drinks.""Ah, look who came crawling back! Potuous, my man, how's it been?""Potuous, the horse, slides his credit card across the counter and grunts.""Heard you got a job at manufacturing,"" says the shadow as it fills a glass of scotch. ""How's that working out for you?""Potuous neighs.""Nay? Alright, I get it. Not every gig's a walk in the park."" The shadow pushes the glass over, and Potuous sinks his muzzle into it, splashing and gulping away. ""I'm sure it's not all bad, though. I mean, you didn't end up here by choice. I, I assume.""The glass falls off the counter and shatters, but the noise dissipates between the notes of the music box in the corner.""Who the hell are you?"" Potuous groans.The shadow chuckles. ""C'mon, Potuous, it's me! Oh, come now, don't tell me you don't remember who I am. We were best pals in highschool! Freshman year? Matching yearbook photos? We, uh, we wrote a book together! Well, it was mostly you, heh, I just gave you the idea.""Potuous tilts his long face at him. ""…Right. Corvid, was it?""""Damn right. I knew you'd remember me."" Corvid takes out another glass and fills it up. ""So how *did* you end up here?""""I'm moving. Just stopped by for a drink.""""Moving? Where to?""""Onwards.""""Ah."" Corvid quickly pours himself a shot glass. ""I'll cheers to that.""Potuous doesn't drink. He watches as Corvid clinks the glasses and downs his hastily-crafted cocktail. A shadow can't ingest liquids; it spills all over the floor, but Corvid covers up his shame with a smile. ""Heh. Still not used to it."" He grabs a towel and crouches below the counter, still within earshot of Potuous's heavy sigh. The horse taps his hooves absent-mindedly, appearing to be happier in a different place.And so the two of them spend the next few minutes in silence, making sure to avoid eye contact but not knowing why. At least, Corvid doesn't know.""Well,"" the shadow finally says, ""it's funny you should come round here now, since—""""I really don't enjoy your presence.""""…oh.""""Look, just give me the tab. I've got things to do.""""Yes. Right."" He pulls out a paper slip and quickly jots down the bill. ""Well, it was nice seeing you again.""Potuous takes his credit card and leaves quietly, returning to the transfinite continuum. Corvid wishes to say something to his friend, but doesn't know what to say. They part ways in silence.He sighs and goes back to mopping the floor. A lizard woman walks up to him, tilting her head as if in pity. ""Why the long face?""""I… I don't know. I feel like I've changed. For the worse. I feel as if there was something in me that I liked about myself, and that I've lost it. I don't know.""""Honey, don't let that quadruped SOB get on your nerves. He's a figment of the past.""""I knew he would come here. I was so excited to see him again. Now I'm… I feel… I feel nothing. I'm not the person I want to be."" Corvid turns to look at her. ""It's not too late, is it? I can still… Things can still change, right?""""I dunno what to tell you. You're literally a shadow.

"A man in a suit struts to the back of the unemployment line. The woman in front of him turns around and observes what he's wearing.""You--"" she began, ""you've got a nice suit, haven't you?

So next he pulled out a tissue from his pocket.""Wonderful tissue, that. Top of the range, isn't it?""The suited man could take no more. He screwed up the tissue and chucked it at her face. ""Yes,"" he snapped, ""all of the items you have listed, are indeed, the finest of the finest. You've a clever eye for a woman with low wages, I must say - and I hope you don't oppose to my frankness, since to me, you seem like someone that does not take offence to a blathering tongue. I am rich, richer than anybody in this queue - or line - I figure it is one of those, however I'm too out of touch with your poor imbeciles that I do not even know the correct term for such a thing.

To invest your hard(ly) earned cash on a useful endeavour? Don't make me laugh! Blasphemous!""""Oh, fuck off you old dog!"" said the woman. ""I'm going to the pub.""",1

"A NTSB investigator is investigating plane wreckage on the I-90 near Sioux Falls An investigator from the NTSB is investigating wreckage from a plane crash on the I-90 near Sioux Falls, SD.Although the main wreckage was mostly on the stretch of highway near Sioux Falls, debris and other parts of the aircraft were scattered across northern Iowa and southern Minnesota, making this a very stressful operation indeed.What had made matters even worse was that no commercial aircraft had reported being in difficulty and it was still proving difficult to determine which airline the apparently large aircraft was registered to, especially given that no airline had reported any aircraft missing or unaccounted for.Similarly, contacts at NORAD had proven difficult to communicate with.As the investigator got closer to the remaining section of the body of the plane, he frowned. Everybody could see half of a US flag emblazoned on the side of the body, but no accompanying insignia or logo or letters.Judging from the shape and size of the fuselage, it looked as if the wreckage could have been that of a 747 airliner, however the investigator couldn't be sure.No response from NORAD. Nothing from the Air Force. Nothing from any airlines. Not even a response of acknowledgment from the White House. This was all very strange.Suddenly, an excited shout broke the grim silence.""Hey!"" A young South Dakota highway patrolman shouted excitedly. ""I've found something!""The highway patrolman was waving what appeared to be a passport.As the investigator got closer, he gasped. More passports were strewn across the ground near some debris but...but he immediately saw that they were old-style British passports.As he grabbed hold of a few and quickly thumbed through them, his shock was paralyzing. On some passports, he saw birth-years ranging from 1896 to 1929 and dates of validity ranging from 1946 to 1951.This was bizarre. The highway patrolman grinned up at him. ""Like something outta the X-Files, huh?""The investigator stared back in stunned silence.The simulation then ended.The instructor strode out from his cubicle and approached the lectern, as his 2,679 students also exited their cubicles and sat down beside them.""As you can clearly see, this investigator has failed to follow Protocols G through W. Obviously he should've have pressed for a speedy response from NORAD, the Air Force and the White House. Also, given the clear 'Special Situation' created by the passports, he should've escalated immediately. That's no small-town investigator - he's federal. No airlines reporting anything; a large 747-like aircraft crashing in broad daylight; nothing on radar minutes before? All points to a clear case of the 'Special Situation' and that's where you and I come in.""",1

"A vivid man walked into a bar. He had the wildest and most chaotic brain in the earth. He could spell of horrors rivaling the unknown that lurk in the vast recesses of outer space.He could pacify the dozens and dozens with these stories, all using his brain. Once he told me, that bartender who's been serving me drinks for the past 23 years, had been hiding a gigantic 🍆. (I've censored what he said with emojis so that you won't be in grave danger.) I asked, ""You're kidding me, right? I wholeheartedly refuse to believe that man has even an above average 🍆, more so a goliath of a 🍆"".But the vivid man whispered to me, ""Look, and you will see a circus."" And so, reluctantly, I asked the bartender, If I could see his 🍆. I have to admit, I have seen some 🍆 in my life, but all of them were shivering and miniscule compared to what the vivid man described. The bartender was half-embarrassed and half-amused. He has been waiting for the day to reveal his 🍆 to his family, but was afraid if they would shun him or not. He figured that I could give an opinion if this was a 🍆 to show or a 🍆 to hide. And so he dropped his 🍆 on the table, making a clap that angels could hear. I was tranced. Albeit in a horrifying way, doubting everything that I had known up to this point. This was not a 🍆 to be admired, but why was I so seduced by it? My wife, my children, I feel as if I have to abandon them, just because this 🍆 has entered my purview. This magnificent and malignant 🍆, both destroyed my life and gave me a reason to start again. I wanted to kiss his 🍆. To hug his 🍆. To beg for his 🍆 as if it was oxygen. This 🍆 was now my salvation, my messiah, my provider. The 🍆 would feed me when I was starving. The 🍆 would spare me some liquid when I was thirsty. This 🍆 was my fountain where I would rest and bathe and worship. No, no, no, no. This can't be, that 🍆 is not perfect. It is just as fragile as me, as human as me, as needing of protection as me. The 🍆 has to know that we both are broken, but with each other, the 🍆 and I can be as one. I will let the 🍆 enter my body. I will let the 🍆 penetrate my mind. I am ready to take the blow to protect this 🍆. The 🍆 will replenish me with periodic strength, while I shield the 🍆 from harm. The 🍆 and I are destined to be with each other, knowing it has picked me and I have picked the 🍆. I cannot thank the vivid man enough for letting me know of the 8th wonder of nature. The 🍆 is drooling with enthusiasm and I am too. The bartender as well is happy for me, having been freed of his 🍆 burden. The 🍆 and I lived happily ever after. The End. The listeners asked me, ""Where is the punchline? I thought this was an elaborate dick joke."" The punchline is you dumdum. I have made you read smut by making you fill in the blanks that were never there.",1
"3 mothers are having a conversation at a Walmart parking lot while carrying their babies. The conversation eventually starts turning more contentious and competitive. They start comparing babies, one of them slaps her baby on top of its head forcefully and exclaims:""See this thing? This baby can scream at a whopping 120 decibels, that's louder than a lion! It also operates at 40 tantrums per minute. Pretty awesome, huh? I just got it, almost fresh out of the womb! It has that new baby smell, have a whiff! Smell it!""The second woman smells it and replies: ""Pfft! Oh yeah? While that's all mildly impressive, can it do this?!"" She says, before throwing her baby at a wall. The baby ricochets off the wall and towards the ground. It then bounces off the ground and back into the her arms.""Bam! That's right! I'd like to see yours do that! It's called super elastic skin, Martha, giving it rebounding properties."" She says proudly, while pinching her baby's cheek and stretching its skin several inches off its face. The baby starts to cry.The third woman starts talking: ""Ooooh! Big whoop! Want to see something amazing? Watch this!"" She puts her baby down onto the ashphalt and starts to pile several large bricks on top of it. ""See how durable this thing is? I swear, it can withstand at least 3500 pounds! I could go on piling thousands of these bricks!""""Bullshit, Susan! That's about the weight of an average car! Prove it!"" The first woman demands.The third woman, seemingly up to the challenge, nods confidently and says back: ""Gladly! Observe this shit, Sarah!"" She knocks the pile of bricks off the baby, picks it up and throws it into the path of an oncoming car.The car comes to a screetching halt after running the baby over and the driver, another woman, hustles out of the car in disbelief.

Are you NOT aware of what just happened?!""The third woman abruptly points at the car and yells: ""Ah! Aha! I knew it! See? There's your culprit!John Goodman eventually finishes climbing out of the car as well and shoots a glance behind the car.

"The Apple Of Eden ""Yo dawg check out this sweet crispy apple,"" Adam said as he was chilling and twiddling with his fig leaf. He started to ponder why exactly he had this leaf in place of a penis and how exactly he knew what penises were. God gave Adam a glare that just read ""Don't you try it kid or I'll add you to my torture porn collection."" and it made him shit himself.   Adam was starting to grow tired of naming all the wildlife gibberish names to appease god. All of his time was either spent doing this or shitting all over the place. It was genuinely growing into a problem as he constantly had to be wary of stepping in his own fecal matter. He had started using the wildlife as towels even. All of god's creations were slowly one by one getting crusted with dried human shit as Adam wiped his feet off on them. Luckily god hadn't programmed them to be anything but docile yet so Adam had been enjoying this freedom almost a little too much. All of a sudden Adam had an epiphany.  Could he reach far enough to fit his fig leaf into his mouth if he had one less rib bone? He wondered how it would taste like. Perhaps he could spin this to god somehow and get his rib out so he could try this experiment? ""Hey man, so you know how you made me in your image and all? If I'm like part godly and all I probably don't need all of my rib bones so you can take one and do whatever you want man. My treat!"" Adam said to God above. He scratched his neck a little in anticipation for the answerGod pondered for a moment and stroked his bushy ginger beard. This was before the grey hairs set in.  ""Perhaps I can forge you a sister for you to copulate with."" he said before sketching out his plan. After many rough drafts that night he settled on throwing testicles on her chest to tell them apart. God gave one snap of the finger and suddenly Adam had one less rib bone. Adam looked up to see God's new creation whilst in the midst of auto-fellatio and noticed that she had no nipples. It was disgusting. It turned him off entirely. Eve took her first step into Adam's shit.",1

"Bob Hope, Usher, Madonna, Martin Luther, Scooby Doo and James Blunt walk into a bar. James Blunt walks up to the bartender.Bartender: I'm beautiful, it's true?James Blunt: No, quite ugly, in fact. Now, pass me your finest Martini please.Bartender: Shaken?James Blunt: Yes, the bitch of a wife just left me.Bartender: The Marti--Scooby Doo comes trundling in \*insert random dog noises\*.Bartender: Scooby Dooby Doo, where are you?  Scooby Doo: \*insert random dog noises\*James Blunt (offering a look of disdain): I thought the sign outside said...Usher: NO DOGS? Bartender: Yeah!  Usher: Yeah?James Blunt: Yes! My goodness, this rapper singer fellow is a trifle attractive, I must say. The contour of his face. One might say that he is rather--Bob Hope: BEAUTIFUL?Scooby Dooby Doo: It's true.Fantastic rhyme there, mister: Bob HopeUsher: Fantastic flipping of the script there, Bobski. Spoken like a true comic. Working backwards, working backwards. Fucking brill, bro.The bartender casts a cautious eye over the group, who have grown rather rowdy. Examining the clock, the bartender sees that there are roughly 8 minutes left until the bar closes, which, undoubtedly, will only cause greater eruption between the entourage, and so, with the utmost strength in his loins, the bartender withholds any further comments, merely he looks at the clock, in suggestive intervals, coughing and clearing his throat, looking at the door, any sort of hint. However, the entourage are stuck in their ways.Scooby Doo: \*insert random dog noises\*Madonna (with Martin Luther under her arm, feeling frivolous): Eh, up! A pint for the lass, please?Bartender: For fuck sake, we're closing in...in 7 minutes.In digital or analogue time, mister?: Bob HopeThe entire room reaches fever pitch. Such a witticism draws Scooby Dooby Doo to tears.Martin Luther:  *Everything that is done in the world is done by...*Me!: Bob HopeMadonna: And a pint for the bartender, please? A rather tolerable fellow during these shenanigans.Bartender: Fuck off, the lot of you, and stop saying 'fellow', it's fucking putrid. Quite frankly, I'm sick of the lot of you. You are the consumers that I dread, the epitome of scum, the truest symbol of a dwindling society that depends on liquid to fuel its heart. There is no blood rushing through those veins, no bones beneath that skin, there is merely a void waiting to be filled by the atmosphere, the rush of the low ceilings...the...the constant teasing of yours truly. Out of here, the lot of you. I---I fucking hate you all.James Blunt (leaning forward): Do you know what I have to say, after hearing such poetry?Madonna: Don't say it.Bartender: Don't say it.James Blunt: Fine, fine. I shan't say it, I shan't. Let's be on our way team, to the next pub down the road. What's it called?Bartender: The Dangling Diaphragm, that's the one.Then they all left and the bartender poured himself a drink and laughed. He chugged it down and slammed it on the wood and checked the clock. They weren't closing for 7 hours, in fact, they had only just opened. If any of the peasants had read the board outside they would have known that, or maybe they did know, maybe everyone was aware.",1
"An agitated Lord Voldemort is sat in a private helicopter enroute to Portland in Oregon He's not happy; he's not satisfied.For the last 850 years, he's had to endure life on Earth, but finally he may be snapping; he may have had enough.Sure, the mansion in Portland is great. Sure, the fresh supply of 18 and 19 years old each week is great. Sure, the sex is great. Sure, the beach house in Malibu is awesome sometimes - and the penthouse in Seattle...and the chalet in Nice. Yeah, great, all great. But Lord Voldemort has grown agitated and restless.So, one day, in 2027, he begins to sell off all of his assets. He then chops off his legs and arms and regrows new strong, long limbs. He then grows a dark black layer of skin, creates a new identity for himself using his sorcery and zips over to Senegal - a former state which had just recently endured a 5-year-long civil war and was now practically three ""countries"".Standing at 7 foot and 3 inches, he uses his sorcery and masculine and domineering persona and strong voice to persuade millions to have him as their leader. He persuades them that under his lifelong dictatorship, they can have a good, long life with security and safety and distributed wealth.By 2030, the Kingdom of Senegal has been recognised by the UN and all countries bar Australia and New Zealand.By 2033, the Kingdom of Senegal has expanded into Mauritania and Mali.By 2035, six more West African countries all hold referendums to voluntarily join the Kingdom.By 2036, the Kingdom of Senegal has peacefully annexed most of West Africa and parts of North Africa.All the while, Lord Voldemort has been using his sorcery to get away with this and has not had to deal with much resistance - except from the Australians and Kiwis, who strangely appear to be immune to his sorcery.By 2040, the Kingdom of Senegal has an official surface area of 1.6million square miles.By 2041, the Kingdom of Senegal has a successful space agency with an annual budget of 2 billion Euros and a ten year plan for six missions to Mars, Callisto, Venus and near-Jupiter space.By 2042, Lord Voldemort is King and lifelong Dictator of over 600 million people. By now, hundreds of millions of people across Africa and the Americas and parts of Asia are reaching out to Voldemort and wish to join the Kingdom.Using his sorcery, Voldemort begins to slowly and gradually take over the world.No rush - he has, after all, got ""all the time in the world"".",1
"I like my women like I like my coffee: Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as ""beans"") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world, and it can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte). It is usually served hot, although iced coffee is a popular alternative.Clinical studies indicate that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption reduces the risk of some diseases, although those long-term studies are generally of poor quality.",1
"A horse walks into a bar. “Why the long face?” The horse says, taking an extra-long queen of hearts from the bartender’s deck of cards. “Why the short face?” The queen says. “Holy shit a talking card,” the horse says.“Holy shit a talking horse,” the bartender says.“Holy shit a talking bartender,” the Queen says.“Holy shit the queen of England is here,” the horse says.“Holy shit a horse with wheels,” the bartender says.But he lied about the wheels.",1

I want to beat him up.” Gay the horse says. “Sorry mate,” said Rick Astley “but if you want to punch the bartender you’ll have to wait in line.” Rick Astley gestured to a long line of people behind him.“ Wait a second.” said a priest who was enjoying a drink at the bar. “Why is there a line of people waiting to punch the bartender? How did the horse not previously notice this? And why is the horse talking? Horses can’t talk.” “That’s because none of this is actually happening.” said the bartender “This is all just a bad joke being posted in r/antiantijokes.” “Wait a minute, you mean all of my life is an illusion?” Gay the horse says. Overwhelmed with existential horror he breaks into tears. A man walks into the bar. He looks at Gay the horse and says “Hey, why the long face?”",1
"A gown man ate an entire pie in his car As he wiped the bits of leftover pie off his face, dabbing the collar of his shirt against his lips to remove the purple stains, he heard a tapping at his window, looking over to see a police officer standing outside. Rolling down the window he gave the officer a nod, placing the empty tray aside. “Morning officer, are you having a peachy day?”“I’m fine, I just got called to check out a suspicious individual. The reports said you were licking the crust of a pie, talking about how you would destroy it once you got into the car. As you can expect a lot of people were concerned with your comments.”“Concerned enough to call the cops? Look, it was just a bit of fun, I did destroy the pie too, see that empty tray next to me? I did that, just dug in and destroyed that pie. It was delicious. As you can see officer, there’s nothing weird, I was just enjoying a snack.”“A snack? You ate a whole pie as a snack?” The officer leaned down towards his chest, whispering into his phone. “Yeah, going to need back up, there’s a freak eating pie in his car.”“Psst, eating pie? I’m sure you can handle that?” The voice on the phone seemed less than thrilled by the officer's concerns, nearly hanging up, only for the officer to say something that got his attention.“He ate the entire thing in his car. This isn’t a normal guy.” The officer must have thought he was being quiet, giving the man a reassuring thumbs up as he listened to the conversation.“The entire thing? Was he at least crying? Maybe he was having a breakdown?” The voice tried to be rational, tried to think of a way to justify the threat, but there was none.The officer leaned closer to him, dragging his tongue along the man’s eyelid, rolling his tongue back into his mouth before responding to the phone. “Not even an ounce of salt on his eyes.”“Stay safe, I’m calling in the big guns.” The phone buzzed off as the officer freed his gun from its restraint. “Ok, hands in the air, I need you to step out of the vehicle.”Still being mentally disturbed by the lick, the man panicked, throwing his arms up only to realize that he couldn’t leave the car with his hands up. “Can you.... Open the door for me? My hands are in the air.” As soon as the man finished the sentence, a bullet fired at the car, knocking off his side mirror. Dropping his arms down, he did what any sane person would do. Stomped on the accelerator and fled, having to duck as a spray of bullets followed his escape.The man could hear the cop screaming at him as he exited the parking lot. “YOU BETTER RUN YOU FREE THINKER!” As the cop said that, it was like the man had a moment of clarity. He was an adult, he could do whatever he wanted. Mortal restraints could not bind him. The man pushed open the car door, leaping out of the moving vehicle. Instead of rolling down the road, he instead floated, hovering above the floor. The cars moving past him seemed slower, allowing him to sidestep the oncoming traffic. He had reached enlightenment.He could hear tugging tanks on the horizon, each drawing near with their weapons facing him. Their weapons couldn’t hurt him. Anything that was shot his way just vanished, he was a God, the pie God. ...at least he *was* until a blackness consumed him, waking up on a hospital bed, a few concerned nurses staring down at him.“Oh, you're awake? You passed out after choking on a handful of pie. Why were you even eating pie in a carpark weirdo? Not that it matters, I’m just glad that you woke up from that nightmare, you wouldn’t stop making weird noises, a few of the other nurses really thought you would die.”The man didn’t know how to respond to that; it had all felt so real. “Sorry” Was all he could mumble, the nurse giving him a nod before leaving to recover. Beside the man sat the half-eaten pie, still in its beautiful silver tin. Well, one more bite wouldn’t hurt.",1

"A man runs over a family of pathologically sarcastic ducks with his car. The mother duck and a few of the ducklings survive. The ducks promptly line up in front of the door on the driver's side of the car after the mother duck checks on her dead ducklings. The man hesitantly opens the door and looks down at the them.""Wooow! Thanks a lot, human! I really appreciate how you didn't pay attention to the road, really courteous of you! Good job, champ! Who needs that many offspring following you around anyway, huh? It gets tiresome. You might as well have another go at it and throw me fucking bone over here. Aim for the remaining four of us. Life is shit anyway."" The mother duck says.""Yeah, wow! Thanks for killing all our siblings, dude. You're truly fucking remarkable behind the wheel. Have you considered racing for Formula 1?"" One of the ducklings remark.The man widens his eyes in suprise and recoils in his seat, clearly taken aback. He replies: ""What?! You ducks can \*talk\*?! No! It can't be!""The mother duck rolls her eyes and says: ""Holy shit, you truly are some kind of savant aren't you? Terrible hand-to-eye coordination and mentally handicapped, yet incredibly observant. Does a bear shit in the woods?!""The mother duck turns to her ducklings and says: ""H-Hey, kids! Did you know that water is \*wet\*?!""""Get the fuck out of here! nO! iT cAn'T bE!"" One duckling says mockingly. The ducks all laugh before another duckling interjects: ""What are you going to tell us next, mother? That the fucking sun is warm?! That Clay Aiken is homosexual?! That the NBA is mostly comprised of black players?!""The man, having regained his composure and accepted the novelty of talking ducks becomes irritated at them. He says: ""When you're all done with this little circle jerk of yours, I'll have you know that you were the ones being reckless by absentmindedly walking into my path. In fact, I'll bet one of you little shits put a dent in my car so you better have those insurance details ready.""The mother duck replies: ""You hear that, kids? Which one of you are carrying the papers with the insurance information?"" A duckling says in return: ""I got this, mother. Here they are.""

Never in a million years would I have thought of that being a factor, never! You've blown my goddamn mind! Who would've thought that they don't give insurance to ducks?!""

What a genius!""The man loses his temper and yells emotionally, with a single tear forming in his eye: ""You guys are complete assholes! Nevermind this!"" He starts to drive off while wiping his eyes.The mother duck yells: ""Wooooow! What a champion! Get a load of this man-child just driving off after murdering my children. Class act!"" The man yells out of the open window: ""Shut up! Shut the hell up!"" He accelerates faster while continuing to wipe tears away from his face, which results in him swerving off the road and crashing into a tree.The ducks run up to the wrecked car. The mother duck yells: ""Oh no! Are you okay? How is it even possible when you're the best driver I've ever witnessed? Hold on, I'm calling for an ambulance! Beep, beep, beep! Hello? This is 911? Yes, I'm at the scene of a car accident. You're going to need two ambulances because me and my entire family are in shock and disbelief that such a skillful driver would fail so miserably!"" The mother duck says while pretending to use a cellphone.One of the ducklings remarks: ""But, mother?! You are a duck? How could you possibly possess a phone?!"" The mother duck feigns suprise and says: ""Oh my god! You are absolutely correct! What was I thinking?! Edoiiii! I'm so silly today.""The man slowly starts to succumb to his wounds as his final moment is accompanied by an increasingly distant ambiance of ducks quacking in mocking tones. The man realises that they're not speaking a human language any longer. Did the entire scenario play out in his head? Is anything even real? Is life just a dream?The man is about to die as one of the ducklings hop into the vehicle and says to him: ""Scoot over, moron. I've always wanted to test drive one of these. The man's last words are: ""How can you even drive when you're a duck?""Before he draws his final breath the duckling says: ""It's okay, they've already registered and made an exception for me at the DMV.""",1

Gods, too, decompose. God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him.”""Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?"" the philosopher finishes. ""Did you like it?"" he asks the bartender.  The bartender, half-asleep, replies, ""Yes, yes.

Why the virus are spreading so fast?3. But why some nations spreading fast, why some nations are not?My statement still do not change, the  advanced technology especially the 5G network are empowering the NCOV  and have a huge contribution into the birth of this virus.The only reason explain why some nations  next to China like Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia but do not get that virus  spreading fast is they are “out-date” technology. Why the farer nations  with advanced technology are record many more cases everyday.**In Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos:** There are no high-end trains, no commercial 5G network, no fingerprint/face regconical at border airport.**What about China, Korea, Singapore, Japan?** Too many public advanced technology sharing devices like bullet train, 5G network, fingerprint biometrics, etc.I remind all of you that, there are 70%  SARS in the NCOV COVID19, which mean air condition will only help  spreading the virus, including public trains, airport.I highly recommend all the so call  scientist do the experiment about the connection of the NCOV COVID19  with the 4G, 5G network and the electric devices.They can put the NCOV COVID19 in the  environment with 5G, 4G, 3G, 2G, and none and observe the virus  everyday, and they will receive the answer whether or not there is a  huge connection with mobile network with the NCOV COVID19.They should try to put that virus and find  out what surface what objects the NCOV “love”: technology devices,  cloth, sand/clay, etc.Many nations are not using common feeling sense but rely on broken technology and digging their own grave.I have made predictions about the collapse of advanced technology nation at least 1-2 years ago, then now it become reality.If the China, Korea, Japan, Singapore,  Israel, etc. do not stop all the 4G, 5G network, air condition on public  train and stop the fingerprint/biometrics collection on border then  they will all gone within the next 60 days for sure.**If you cannot prove my statement are wrong, then it must be true.****Stop asking me about tiny science  proof evidence for science cannot record many things, including the  super small seed of the NCOV COVID19 !!!**Best Regard,**The Savior**",1

"A dog walks into a bar. The dog sits up on the counter seat, attracting some strange looks from patrons. One of the two customers sitting next to the dog hold out their hand as if asking if he could be petted, but the dog avoids their hands, leaving a slightly confused look on the customer's face.""What can I get you?"" the bartender asks. ""I would like to have a beer, please; more specifically, a non-alcoholic beer without the beer."" the dog replies snobbishly, with an accompanied snort.The bartender looks slightly bemused at the dog's strange request, but accepts the order anyway.  After a few minutes of the bartender serving other patrons, the dog's order is given to him within three seconds: an empty glass. The expression on the dog's face, originally as neutral as a dog's face can be, now looks slightly annoyed. Before the bartender can leave, the dog challenges the bartender with ""This is not what I asked for.""The bartender says ""Huh? You asked for a beer without a beer. That's what I gave you.""The dog snorts. ""Excuse me, it was a _non-alcoholic_ beer. And this is not what I asked for. You see, I asked for an impossible request: I asked for something that qualifies as a beer but is not a beer, and is non-alcoholic. Clearly, nothing can fit this description by the law of non-contradiction, and yet you still gave me something. This means that whatever you have given me is incorrect.""The bartender replies with ""It may have been the case that the denotative meaning of the thing you asked clearly has no match, and is therefore impossible; however, the connotative meaning of what you asked is that you wanted the package of a beer, glass + beer, minus alcohol, minus the beer. That's simply a glass minus the alcohol, and since a glass has no alcohol, this is what you wanted under your connotative meaning.""The dog replies snarkily ""Being a dog, I clearly evade human intuition when it comes to thought. When you took my order, a good bartender would have seen the dog in the seat and realized that since the dog thinks in a completely different way than humans do that it may choose to use the declarative meaning rather than the connotative in order to avoid confusion, and therefore taken the declarative meaning as the thing that the dog wanted.""The bartender questions ""Yet you, as a dog, are currently speaking perfect English, and replying to my responses perfectly. This means that you must indeed have an understanding of the connotative meaning of how humans speak in order to even respond to the responses I am giving you. Therefore, you know that connotative meanings are taken into account, and therefore provided something that fits under the connotative meaning rather than the declarative.""The dog says, ""Indeed! However, I simply accounted for the fact that if you were a _good_ bartender, then you would have taken the declarative meaning, and provided me with what I wanted. And remember that the only reasonable response to the connotative meaning of the order would be to take the declarative meaning under general human behavior, you would have done what I wanted anyway! Therefore, I simply accounted for the declarative meaning, and not the connotative.""The bartender exclaims, ""Enough! We all know that this is folly. The _true_ answer here is that whereas you, as a dog, somehow use perfect declarative meaning and the logical axioms to construct your perception of the world, we as humans use connotative meaning and ill-defined axioms to construct our perception of the world. The fundamental difference here is in the axiomatic system being used, and therefore can never be fixed unless one of us changes our fundamental axioms, which is impossible without killing ourselves.""The dog says with a tone of finality, ""However, since I still feel annoyed, I can and will disprove the fundamental axioms of human perception as even being axioms in the first place, and simply construct for myself a bar where the bartender is a _good_ bartender _and_ the declarative meaning is taken into account first.""Around the dog, the lights flicker rapidly before cutting out, removing all light in the bar. Several of the patrons look around in surprise, and a guy reading a book in the back looks up disappointed.  Then, the patron next to the dog begins to flicker. Their image seems to randomly stretch in its dimensions and change state, from the patron smiling to drunk to depressed to crying to naked to nonexistent. Several of the patrons seeing one of their members dissipate this suddenly rapidly begin to panic, and they flood out of the bar quickly. The bartender, however, makes no attempt to move as the floorboards stretch and crack under the stress of being logically disproven to even exist. A strange expression appears on the bartender's face before morphing into a smile.Suddenly, all logical disproving stops. The lights turn back on to illuminate a now mostly empty bar, and the floorboards seem to be back where they were. Even the patron next to the dog reappears again.The dog exclaims in horror, ""What happened?!"" The dog's face looks shallow at considering that _their_ axioms may be inconsistent.The bartender smiles and simply says ""I have figured out your little 'trick', and have something for you. Since you have proven our logical axioms inconsistent, by the principle of explosion, I can prove anything I want. 1+1=3, something that is true is false, and you are nonexistent and never have ever existed.""The dog looks horrified at his blunder and immediately jumps off the bar stool in an attempt to dash away, and fails. The dog's image beings to warp and stretch, cycling through everything the dog has ever done before immediately collapsing back in on itself and everything in the bar reverting. The bar looks the same as it always had, with the same customer in the corner reading a book, an empty stool that might have housed a dog if a dog came into the bar, and patrons drinking their beer as usual.What the bartender doesn't realize, though, is that he himself committed a blunder, a blunder so significant that he cannot ever realize he had committed it. By making the dog not exist via the principle of explosion, he himself has forgotten how to manipulate the logical makeup of the world around him and therefore has given up the power over everything in existence and everything not in existence, something that kings and queens and presidents have striven for for eons.Perhaps you could say that the bartender's blunder was _explosively_ bad.",1

Wanting to be happy is the first step towards happiness, but it is only that—the first step. The second step is to allow happiness to flow into your mind. It's like establishing a socket—you can't expect to receive data before you open a port.""""Wanna have sex?""""Sure.""The tycoon and the old man copulate for the next hour, then they kiss each other goodbye and go back to their boring, unfulfilling lives.

""What place in the solar system takes 40 years to reach? Nowhere as far as I know...""""Dude,"" my buddy replied. ""It's called 'the 40-year starship' because that's the time it's taking to construct the whole thing - like building a big modern city from scratch!

You've never heard of a Moscow Eel?Imam: Nope.Rabbi: Neither have I. What's in it?Priest: Well... You got your ginger, your lime, your vodka...Rabbi: What else?Priest: Guess.Imam: Surely there isn't actually an eel in it?Rabbi: No way.Priest: Bingo.Imam: An eel? As in an actual eel?Priest: I promise you, it tastes divine.Rabbi: I don't believe this! Is the eel just sorta swimming around in there?Priest: No, it's dead you numpty! It's not wriggling around or anything. It's a dead eel and you just sorta swallow it all up with the booze.Rabbi: Well that sounds swell but count me out.

There are plans for a new mosque on Princeton Avenue - the council are in talks with some of the people there currently and they want to consult me on it.

Almost choked as he spluttered out the words 'I do'. Coulda swore he winced as he said it.Rabbi: Almost choked! Ha!Priest: Looked like a nice kid though, I felt bad for him really. His mother looked more enthusiastic than he did. Sitting there, huge hat on her head, like a big meringue - sobbing and smiling. 'They're so dreamy together!' she kept saying. Talk about living vicariously through your children.Imam: Happens more than you think. You see so many young people still at the beck and call of their parents instead of living their own lives.Rabbi: Yeah, and it's a real shame. If I'd gone the way my mother had wanted, I'd probably still be in that cramped little office in Milwaukee, making ten dollars an hour, wishing I could shove every rotten cent up my boss's ass. So, I'm thankful I got outta there as soon as I could.Imam: And you found God.Rabbi: Right, best boss of all.

They wait for his return in silence. Everything is still. There is no indication that time is passing, other than low drone of their breathing, like the ticking of an infinite clock. It slowly dawns on the men that the bartender is never coming back. He no longer exists - he has faded into nothingness like the shadow of a smoke ring. And they come to realise that there is nothing beyond these four walls, nothing beyond the sunlit facade that stands limply behind the windows. All is absence. No Princeton Avenue. No sobbing mother with a hat like a meringue. No Milwaukee.

"A penguin is ice fishing at the North pole. ""I hope to catch some fish today,"" says the penguin. She lowers the baited hook into the frigid water.""I hope I don't get eaten,"" says the bait, a sentient gummy worm, the fancy sugar-coated kind.""I hope a fish doesn't swallow me,"" says the hook, a sentient paperclip, the fancy grooved kind.""I hope I don't snap,"" says the line, a sentient strand of wool, the fancy superwash merino kind.A largemouth bass swims up to the bait.

WHAT DO YOU EAT?""The worm shivers, mostly from fear, but also from the cold water too. ""Uh....I eat...hooks! Sentient paperclip hooks, the fancy grooved kind. I have one in me right now...better watch out!""""I LOVE HOOKS,"" says the largemouth bass. ""ESPECIALLY PAPERCLIPS, THE FANCY GROOVED KIND. I HAVE SEVERAL IN ME RIGHT NOW!""The paperclip gets goosebumps, mostly from fear, but also from the cold water too. ""I...I'm attached to a really strong line! You'd have to break the line first, and by that time, you'd be fished from the water!""""I'VE BROKEN LINES MADE OF CARBON NANOTUBE,"" the largemouth bass gloated. ""NO MATERIAL OR METHOD CAN IMPEDE MY CONSUMPTION OF THE BAIT.""The line twists and felts, mostly from fear, but also from the cold water too. ""Even if you do break me, I'm not hypoallergenic! You could have a serious allergic reaction.""The largemouth bass swims around the baited hook in contemplation. The penguin watches hungrily from above. After a few moments, the bass opens its maw, and lunges towards the bait. The worm is sucked from the hook and proceeds into the bass's gizzard, while the hook becomes lodged in its cheek. The penguin jerks the fishing pole upward securing the catch, and lifts the largemouth bass from the water.The penguin leans in close to the bass's large green eye. ""Hello, I'm a penguin, and I eat largemouth bass.""The largemouth bass shrinks its mouth around the line, below the Planck length of 1.6 x 10\^-35 m.^(""Oh, is that so?"")Upon measurement from the penguin, uncertainty in the bass's velocity exceeds the speed of light as predicted by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The bass is torn from reality itself, severing the line. As the bass's mouth returns to normal size, it manifests underwater in a world orbiting an alien sun. Unfortunately, when the hook and attached line reach the fish's gizzard, the fish has an allergic reaction to the wool and dies.The bait, hook, line, and bass go to heaven and meet St. Peter at the pearly gates.""Why should I let you in to heaven?"" asks St. Peter.""I'm a sentient gummy worm, the fancy sugar coated kind,"" says the worm. St. Peter lets the worm into heaven.""I'm a sentient paperclip hook, the fancy grooved kind,"" says the hook. St. Peter lets the hook into heaven, where it penetrates the worm, resuming its natural place within the bait.""I'm a sentient strand of wool, the fancy superwash merino kind,"" says the line. St. Peter lets the line into heaven, where it ties itself around the hook, restoring the trinity of bait, hook, and line.""I'M A LARGEMOUTH BASS, AND I EAT SUGAR-COATED GUMMY WORMS, GROOVED PAPERCLIP HOOKS, AND SUPERWASH MERINO WOOL LINES.""""Oh, is that so?"" says St. Peter, as his cranium opens to project a hologram of the bass's sub-Planck length mouth from moments earlier. The bass is cast down to hell where it befriends Max Planck and Werner Heisenberg, and lives happily ever after.",1
"A Man Walks Into a Bar However, he leaves as soon as he enters. More Antiantijokes need to end like this. The man only left because it was crowded in there, from all the ""Walks into a bar"" Antiantijokes there are. Just because an infinite number of mathematicians can fit into the bar doesn't mean it should contain an infinite number of individuals. For fucks sake people, there's only a single Bartender, how's he supposed to tend to all the patrons in there.Anyways, the bartender, sick of tending to all the patrons in the bar, pulled out a gun with an infinite amount of ammunition, and shot himself in the head. The first of a set of an infinite number of mathematicians took his place. However, after doing the math, the mathematician came to the conclusion that tending to all the patrons was mathematically impossible. He picked up the gun, but the second of a set of an infinite number of mathematicians asked how he knew he was the first of a set of an infinite number of mathematicians, and not, say for example the seven hundred twenty six nonillion three hundred twenty nine octillion five hundred seventy two heptillion six hundred fifty eight hexillion seven hundred forty seven quintillion two hundred eighteen quadrillion seventy one trillion four hundred six billion nine hundred ninety nine million six hundred and sixty sixth mathematician. The first mathematician, confused at how the second came up with such a small number, told him that the numbering system was completely arbitrary; he's the first because he decided he would be the lowest numbered mathematician, and the second is the second, because he was the first mathematician he saw that wasn't himself. The first mathematician then shoots himself in the head, leaving the second mathematician to become the first.The new first mathematician comes to the same mathematical conclusion that the previous, being that it would be mathematically  impossible to serve every patron in the bar. He picked up the gun, but the new second of a set of an infinite number of mathematicians asks how he knows he's the first of a set of an infinite number of mathematicians, and not yet another arbitrarily small number. The first mathematician gives the same answer as the previous first mathematician, then shoots himself in the head.This cycle continues until we reach the final first of a set of an infinite number of mathematicians. He comes to the same conclusion the previous infinity mathematicians about serving all the patrons being impossible, and picks up the gun. However, since there is no new second mathematician to ask him how he knows he's the first mathematician, and not some arbitrarily small number, he is able to answer the question by stating that he's the only mathematician left from the set of an infinite number of mathematicians, and puts the gun down.There is, however, a second unique set of an infinite number of mathematicians in the bar. The first mathematician from the previous set attempts to use the gun to shoot them all, but discovers that the gun is out of ammunition. The first mathematician of the second set of an infinite number of mathematicians asks for 1 beer, the second asks for half a beer, the third asks for a quarter of a beer. The first mathematician from the first set of an infinite number of mathematicians puts 2 beers on the counter, and tell the infinite number of mathematicians to split the beer among themselves. The first mathematician from the first set of an infinite number of mathematicians the exits the bar.The first mathematician encounters the man who walked into the bar earlier, but left, and tells the man that there are an infinite and one fewer people in the bar, so it should be far less crowded. The man then walks into the bar, and finds an infinite number of dead people lying at the counter. He tries to order a beer, but finds there are no bartenders. He finds the set of an infinite number of mathematicians arguing over who's the nine hundred twenty seven billion six hundred ninety two million eight hundred six thousand and twenty seventh mathematician, and who's the nine hundred twenty seven billion six hundred ninety two million eight hundred six thousand and twenty eighth mathematician. The man kindly asks the set of an infinite number of mathematicians where the bartender went. The four hundred sixty seventh mathematician tells him that the bartender's had his limit, and does not exist.",1

"A square cup walks into a bar. The square cup says to the bartender, ""Man, life's been rough lately. Even though I earned my economics degree at the top of my class nearly six months ago, I'm still unable to find a job! I beg you, pour me a pint of your special ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄ to help me forget for a little while.""The bartender, not wishing to further pry into the cup's personal life, quietly obliges, pouring a pint of ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄ into the talking cup's head. Immediately, the glass of ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄ suspiciously transforms into a glass of root beer with equal mass and volume. Although one would assume a square cup would have experience with such a phenomenon, the square cup is taken aback. Not wanting to raise any suspicion about his surprise, he pays for the drink, thanks the bartender, and leaves the bar with his heart pounding.As the square cup gets his wits about him, he immediately contacts a porcelain manufacturer based in China. He arranges for a shipment of 500 porcelain square cups to be sailed to the United States every other Tuesday for 20,000 Chinese Yuan, having paid for the first shipment through a large loan. Once the first shipment arrives, the cup takes the public transport to the very same bar, a luxury which he can seldom afford. He walks into the bar armed with ten identical square cups. ""Pour me ten pints of your finest ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄,"" the cup demands of the bartender.Not wanting to miss out on the profits that could be made by selling ten pints of the notoriously expensive ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄, the bartender silently obliges, pouring the square cup ten shimmering pints of ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄ into each of the square cups. The ten pints of ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄ begin to change composition once more into root beer, as the original square cup predicted. He rushes out of the bar and to the local market to sell some of this substance. Those who purchase it regard it as ""the purest and most delicious root beer the world has ever seen,"" and its market value skyrockets.As the Chinese workers labor, producing more and more square porcelain cups, the original square cup begins to increase his scale of production more and more, hiring more and more employees to demand more and more ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄ from the original bartender. As the square cup's pile of money exponentially increases in size, the entire world develops an inexplicable addiction to the new, purest form of root beer. The formula is kept secret from the public, ensuring a perpetual monopoly on the production of pure, addictive root beer. Indeed, the entirety of humanity becomes helplessly enslaved by the iron grip of the Square Cup, as He is the only one who sells that which they must purchase. The men and women of America speak His name with a tone of mixed fear and admiration. All men and women love the Square Cup. All hail the Square Cup. All hail.",1

"A man walked up to a robotic jukebox Said jukebox was situated in the dark corner of a bar, in the year 2074, just after the crumble of the Slovakian Empire Take Two.""What's that?"" asked the reader.""It's really not important,"" said me.So the 2074 jukebox sensed the approaching regular customer and opened up his profile. ""Hello, customer FG352, Dale Pale.""""Witness,"" said Dale, which I'm pretending is a future greeting used by the masses.""What can I play for you today?"" asked the jukebox. ""The usual?""""No, not the usual,"" said Dale, ""I-""""-Not Unusual by Tom Jones, coming up...""""What!? No!"" said Dale. Tom Jones could be heard singing from all the speakers of the bar. Not the real Tom Jones of course, he had been dead for forty years or so. Tom Jones for all the children reading this is a real person, a welsh singer with weird hair who tried a comeback some time around 2000 but honestly it was kind of sad because he was singing collaborations with that hot chick from The Cardigans even though there appeared to be about a ninety year age difference.Dale Pale despised this song to the point that it always made him tear his hair out. But one artist that enraged him even more was Marvin Gaye.""Why?"" asked the reader. ""Was he racist?""""No,"" said me, ""But assuming its because he was racist is a bit racist!""Dale Pale stood in the dark bar pulling at his hair, screaming. Blood formed around his eye holes. ""What's going on!?""""What's Going On by Marvin Gaye, coming up..."" said the robotic voice of the jukebox.""No!"" screamed Dale Pale, in agony. Smoke began pouring out of his ears. His knee caps caved in and he was slowly stumbling to the floor. A bartender, Bill, blinked at him from behind the bar.As Dale's legs bent back and forth in some insane display of agony, his jeans tore and ripped.

His knees and shins are broken and his jeans are all ripped at the seams and torn-""""Sandstorm by Darude, coming up,"" said the jukebox.""Oh thank god,"" whispered Dale Pale. ""Finally, my...my song.""Osswald Nausgaard III or whatever kneeled down to the human mess that was Dale Pale. ""Are you okay?"" he asked.""I am now, thank you.""""This was your song?""""Yes.""""Huh,"" said Oswald.""Now I can die a happy man.""""You're not going to die! I can save you!""""No,"" whispered Dale Pale with one of his last breaths. ""I have a bomb in my jeans pocket. I planned all along to Kill You.""""What, like Murder on the Dancefloor?""""Yes. More than enough to just make you Hurt.""""Really?"" said Asswald.""Yea I was planning on hitting you first.""""Well before you die, I'll let you hit me, baby, one more time-""""NO. No, no, no. That's enough,"" said me the writer. I can't do this anymore. Not only am I running out of songs and clutching at invisible straws but my break is about to finish.""""Who's this guy?"" asked Dale Pale.""Some son of a bitch,"" said Asswald III. ""Let's kill him.""Dale smiled before saying, ""Yes. Yes, let's.""Bill the bartender threw us all out before the fight began.

Numerous large monitors decorate the dark walls of the hall, and at the other end is a massive window, offering a fantastic view of the Shadow Realm and all of its floating islands and skies. Before the window stands a figure, draped with a long, ornate velvet robe, gazing at the view silently and without motion.The convict, who I should probably mention is Clie Nt, approaches the figure apprehensively. Though her footsteps clearly echo around the penthouse, the figure seems to be deliberately ignoring them. *Is this Him?* Clie wonders.""Evening."" His soft voice reverberates in the hall. What terrible acoustics.Clie freezes in place. ""Uh… evening?""He draws a deep breath, but still keeps his gaze fixed on the window. ""I trust that you've something to discuss.""""Well, yes. Kind of. I've been asked to deliver a warning.""The figure turns around. Clie isn't sure what face she expected him to have, but she is nonetheless baffled. His face is human. Beautifully human and innocent. The most distinct feature about it, doubtless, is his eyes, which boast a lovely golden color, an immaculate shade reminiscent of a whispering field of wheat bathed in the beams of a winter sunset. How droll.His eyes vaguely widen at the sight of her. ""Clie Nt. Curious. You, of all people, I did not expect to find here.""""Er… Do I know you?""""I presume not. But I have heard much about you."" He steps across the penthouse towards one of the monitors, beneath which a keyboard appears. He types something on it, and the screen fills with small text, scrolling up and down and shifting about. ""These are your tales. And I think we are in yet another one.""""Well… who are you, then?""He directs his yellow gaze to her. ""I am the one known as the Shadow Master. I am the ruler of this world. But that is less important—tell me, Clie, what warning have you come to deliver?""""It's about… the Ordinaryman. And how you have to destroy him.""""The Ordinaryman? Hmm."" He walks over to another monitor and types something else into it. Some more text appears on the screen, which he takes a moment to read. ""I see. A rogue character, convinced that he is real. How bemusing."" He leaves the monitor and ambles back to the center of the room, to submerge himself in the view of his kingdom.Clie raises an eyebrow. ""Well? Are you going to destroy him?""The Shadow Master sighs. ""Clie, I get requests all the time, about all kinds of things. When people are desperate, they come to me. Perhaps they see in me a mere last resort.""He gestures at a large drawer in the wall. Clie approaches it warily and pulls it open, revealing the corpse of a beautiful woman upon whose chest a bloody pentagram has been carved. Clie recoils in horror. ""What the hell?!""""Indeed. This is just one of many 'sacrifices' I have been offered by some overworld organization. Their request is always the same: 'Contumeliis afficiunt Xakh'ath'akh'arus.'""""Xakh'ath'akh'arus… I know that name.""""Yes, it should be familiar. But these requests are not from your time—they date back to far earlier than when Xakh'ath'akh'arus first appears. Somehow, they had predicted what was to come, and asked me to destroy it.""""But you didn't.""He says nothing.""Why?""""Because I am not God. I am not the Author. I do not dictate what happens beyond my domain. The Shadow Realm is mine, and nothing else is.""""But… the fate of the world relies on it! You *have* to destroy the Ordinaryman, or all is doomed! Isn't it?""He chuckles half-heartedly. ""No. It isn't. That would be exciting, though, would it not? Defectus likes to pretend that his world lives on its own. That he can surrender control and watch its timeline go on without him. He created this dimension, too, and gave its command to me—as if it made any difference. He says he has no control over this realm, but that is not true; even these words that I speak, and the words that you speak, and everything that surrounds us—it's all his.""""So why does he do it? Why does he pretend that his work is alive if it so clearly isn't? And if he truly makes everything, as well as the words you just said, why does it seem as if he's now admitting that it's all fake?""""I fear I know not the answer. Perhaps it is for his own amusement. Perhaps for the amusement of others. Perhaps this is just something to distract him from his otherwise uneventful and dull life. Perhaps he wants people to like him. Perhaps this is the only medium of storytelling he feels comfortable with. Perhaps he's not competent at anything, and this is the only way he can both admit it and continue talking. I don't know. It's all open to interpretation."" He sighs deeply. ""That being said, I've made a promise. If I do find the Ordinaryman lurking around the Shadow Realm, I shall surely send him to ​.""""To… to what?""""​.""""Are you saying something? I can't tell.""""Indeed. ​ is a rather peculiar place; it is, in fact, nothingness. The nature of its nothingness, however, is remarkable—​ spreads at a very slow rate, and yet anything and everything it touches becomes part of it. There is no escape from ​; once you go in, you're not coming out. Simple as that. Allow me to demonstrate.""He walks over to yet another monitor, where instead of black text on a white background, live footage of a large dinosaur asleep on a hillside is displayed on the screen. ""This is Rex the Tyrannosaurus. Earlier today, he slaughtered an innocent herbivore and devoured its carcass. As retribution, I shall send him to ​. Observe.""The Shadow Master performs an odd gesture with his hands, and a brief snapping sound is heard. When Clie returns her gaze to the monitor, the dinosaur has vanished from the hillside.""Now, here is ​,"" he says, pressing a button on the keyboard. The view of the hillside is replaced by a transparent background, through which the back of the monitor can be seen. The figure of the same sleeping dinosaur appears in the center, but it soon begins evaporating at an accelerating rate, its body breaking apart faster and faster into nothingness, until, mere seconds later, it is completely gone, and all that remains is a blank screen.""Rex is no more."" He presses a button on the keyboard and the screen turns black. ""That shall be the fate of the Ordinaryman, as well, if he is to set foot in my kingdom.""""Hmm. Isn't that cruel?""""That is up to Defectus to decide. He is the one making these decisions.""""Does that truly exempt you from your moral obligations, though?""""Perhaps. I am not one to judge."" The Shadow Master returns to his view. ""Now that you have delivered your warning, it is time to close the loop. I shall send you back to your time, and to your friend. You will surely see me again in your future, but as for me, this is farewell. Best of luck on your journey, Clie. You will not need it."" He does another odd gesture, and Clie disappears.[How droll.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiAntiJokes/comments/cx2da1/i_like_my_coffee_like_i_like_my_women/f59fwb5)",1

"What was that mysterious sound???? A man is driving down the road and his car breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?""The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound.............................................................................................But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.By some weird chance that you REALLY are a monk, feel free to pm me and i shall tell you what the sound was.

"Obama is trying to take our WHAT?!? What's this I hear that Obama wants to take away our gum? He better not! 1776 will commence again if they try to take away our chewing gum!I know the argument, that the founding fathers never envisioned gum would ever have moreflavors than the one flavor they had back in 1776(sawdust) that they never imagined we would create gum that could create bubbles bigger than our heads!And I know people ask if we really need packs of gum that have more than ten pieces, if that gum is Fruit Strips, then yes, we do, with that gum the flavor is gone as soon as it hits your tongue, like it never was there...kind of like my dad...What people need to understand is that it's not the gum that put itself in girls hair, it's the person who chewed the gum up and then placed it in the girls hair. If you take away our gum, that isn't going to stop the pranksters, they'll just put something else in girls hair! The kids are to blame, not the gum, it's the pranksters...and also probably video games...And if you take away our gum then only the criminals will have gum, only criminals will enjoy minty fresh breath and delicious flavors such as watermelon and grape. That would be the true crime.I just want our government to know that you will have to pry my hubba bubba from my cold, dead hands!",1
