But also loneliness, stress, and sadness make you lose sleep pretty easy. When you\u2019re with him, all the distractions leave, and he has a peaceful sleep. A presence in the bed makes you forget about the stressful situations at work or about worries ans duties. When you see someone loved sleeping next to you, you realize that those problems are not worth worrying about. Yes, it can be explained scientifically but it doesn\u2019t have to. It\u2019s just that, when we feel lonely in bed, we lose desire to have a peaceful, healthy sleep. But when somebody is with us, we cherish those moments and sleep along with them. Simple.",

Severe cases of OCD can cause an extreme amount of distress, and the disorder can dramatically interfere with a person\u2019s daily life. Sufferers of OCD are generally very anxious and emotional. They display many non- OCD symptoms, such as signs of depression, excessive worry,extreme tension, and the constant feeling that nothing is ever right. Aside from the obvious compulsive behaviors a person with OCD displays, there are no physical signs of this disorder; however, a person with OCD can develop physical problems. For example, a person with a germ obsession may wash their hands so much that the skin on them becomes red, raw and painful. A person with OCD may experience multiple short-term effects, including the inability to function as a contributing member of society, difficulties at school or work,or trouble maintaining friendships or romantic relationships. The long-term effects of OCD generally develop due to the poor quality of life that most extreme sufferers have. Long-term effects include depression, constant anxiety and an increased risk of substance abuse.",

If you go out, make sure you have snacks and drink, and do not go out at nap time. Offer food before the meltdown, hand her a drink, put her down for a nap before she gets over tired. This will pass, but ONLY if it never works. By that I mean, never give in to the tantrum. If you are out somewhere and she starts, calmly pick her up. Say this is not a good way to behave, carry her back to your car and go home. If that means leaving a full cart of groceries, so be it. If she does it at home, ignore her, but keep her safe. By that I mean do not let her throw things or crash into things. I used to sit on the floor and pull my child into my arms, my legs over hers, my arms crossed over her arms. I wasn't holding her down, I was holding her safe. I didn't talk to her during this, stayed calm, and I kept my head up so she couldn't head butt me. Once she realizes that tantrums will not get her what she wants, she will stop, and it probably won't even take too long. I had five children, but only had to deal with this a few times. I think the older ones told the younger ones to forget it, as it didn't work. With children, you can say no 99 times. If you say yes once, the child will only learn that it worked once, and will keep trying the behavior you don't like. Be strong, be consistent and stay calm. My kids would sometimes yell, I hate you! I would reply, that's okay, I love you. I'd hear, You're mean! I'd reply, yes, I am, but I love you. See the humor in it and know it's just a passing phase. Good luck!",

I, as a British person, born and brought up and still living in the UK had never heard of the term jaywalking until a few years ago, and then, it was only in films. I would generally just ignore that part of a movie, it someone said here was a jaywalker or something similar, as I hadn't a clue what it was. One day I thought about googling it, and found that in the US, aswell as most countries around the world, its illegal to cross the road if not at a marked crossing. Punishments vary from fines to even short jail terms. I have been abroad and never heard the term jaywalking but it seems ridicualous that it is illegal to cross the road. In the UK, we can cross the road pretty much wherever we like unless otherwise stated at the time and place. We instead teach our children how to cross the road safely. Which seems better.",

The CIA first aligned itself with extremist Islam during the Cold War era. Back then, America saw the world in rather simple terms: on one side, the Soviet Union and Third World nationalism, which America regarded as a Soviet tool; on the other side, Western nations and militant political Islam, which America considered an ally in the struggle against the Soviet Union. Not to mention, the CIA gave birth to Osama Bin Laden and breastfed his organisation during the 1980\u2032s. Former British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, told the House of Commons that Al Qaeda was unquestionably a product of Western intelligence agencies.",

It isn't. All that's required for a new variant of a species to emerge from an evolutionary process is for that variant to occur and survive over time. That can happen whether the ancestor species sticks around or not. What makes this non-obvious is that most species don't survive long-term; the vast, vast majority of species that have existed on Earth are extinct now. So if you look back, chances are that any given ancestor of any given modern species is long gone. But that's not necessarily because it was replaced per se. Rather, it probably coexisted for quite a long time with its descendant, gradually dying out for whatever reason (possibly, but not necessarily, including being outcompeted for scarce resources -- it's definitely true that competition plays a big role) until only the more recent species remained. Viewed from afar, this looks a bit like \"species A transformed into species B\" but that's just a conceptual shortcut, not the actual mechanism at work.",

Yes, it doesn't sound like it makes sense, but believe me - when you scale up on speed and precision - automatically you will be comfortable to move from one scale to the other, It also helps you in creating accurate notes while picking. You might wonder how 'Scales' could probably help - this is because you are so familiar with make accurate sounds, your skill of picking, sliding, hammer-ons & pull-offs become almost effortless.
