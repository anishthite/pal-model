That is, why, after the suicide of Anja (my first partner, who was sexually abused by her father) I swore myself an oath, that I would stick up for victims. That is my mission on Quora. To raise consciousness about the devastating effects of sexual abuse. If you have no ability, to handle intimacy, no capacity to trust people; if you blame yourself for the abuse; if you feel inferior, and deeply ashamed of yourself, live is very, very hard. We, as a society, should do everything in our power, to help victims heal, to help them, to support them. To make them feel welcome, to keep their hope alive. To go out of our way, to establish trust with them. To prove to them, that not all men are abusers. To help them to regain the capacity to trust.

  "full_text": "To me, it makes more sense to go with a procedure which is permanent rather than something which is temporary, such as waxing, trimming, shaving etc. The more ideal option would be permanent hair reduction through laser, or electrolysis. In both cases, the hair will not recur after the completion of the procedure.*Electrolysis is a bit more protracted than laser, and can be painful, as it involves passing a mild electric shock through each hair (individually) so as to destroy the hair follicle. On the other hand, laser hair removal entails a high pulse laser beam being directed at the follicle of the root, causing its destruction and thereby preventing hair from sprouting again. Laser removal is almost painless and might be accompanied by redness and soreness of skin, at a mild level. Both procedures ideally require multiple sittings before they are completed satisfactorily. Both methods are perfectly safe to be used on pubic as well as underarm regions of your body. The one catch with laser is - it works best on skin of light complexion and hair which is thicker and darker, than vice versa, while the same does not apply to electrolysis. Regarding hair removal creams, they may or may not cause darkening - it depends upon the chemical composition of the product, and your reaction to it. Some people attempt to counteract the darkening using hydroquinone or mequinol (with renin) subsequent to darkening (both chemicals used for tropical depigmentation).I think I've addressed the issue adequately. *In case of electrolysis, there will be no recurrence of hair, but in case of laser hair removal, there are minor chances of hair recurrence, especially triggered by hormone changes, among other factors.

Spiritualism is the belief that unmeasurable spirits exist in addition to the measurable natural world as two separate domains, which interact within living things, which are both natural and spiritual. It is directly contrasted with naturalism, which posits either that no spiritual realm exists, or that no spiritual realm needs to exist. Many people make the mistake of assuming naturalism to be opposed to theism, but there are naturalistic theists in the world, particularly in less modernised nations. These are people who believe a god exists in the natural world, in apex predator forms, as a human ruler, and/or even in inanimate objects like the earth. Ancient Aztecs were naturalistic theists, who worshipped a pantheon of natural gods, which include the sun, moon, king, and famously, Quetzalcoatl, the avian god. Incidentally, one thing they got right was that birds and reptiles are related\u2026 something only discovered centuries later to be true through fossil records, though this could simply have been a lucky guess\u2026 or an unrecorded observation of an ancient fossil of a transitional species. Most naturalistic theist beliefs have been supplanted by modern science, while spiritualism, due to its nature, is impossible by definition to disprove.
