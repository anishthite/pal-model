Pretty sweet post so far, huh? I'd add some more sugar, but you guys would probably be salty, which would be counterproductive. Speaking of counterproductive, I once knew a guy who was like that - he built counters for a living. He was a math teacher. Another guy I know was double-majoring in math and entomology - called himself a mothmetician. Really bugged me at first, but now I realize it's pretty fly.

&#x200B;

Speaking of flying, someone once asked me if I knew any bird puns. I said that there weren't many to s-beak of, but I tried to wing it and post one on twitter. It attracted a lot more puns - real technical, wordy ones. I guess nerds of a feather flock together. One of them tried to Switch things up by talking about video games - no pun Nintendo-ed

302,adoption,"so basically, when I was young, I was in a bunch of orphan homes and stuff.

He is a really rich dude, looking to do the weird homeschool thing in the cool mansion. I still remember the stiff cot under me when he came in. 

""Hey,"" he said   
""hi,"" I said. 

he left immediately, and then came back later. that's all he needed, and I was adopted immediately. I was so happy. we got into his nice Mercedes, and drove off. We stopped at a nearby restaurant, which was the first meal I had had outside the orphanage in years.
