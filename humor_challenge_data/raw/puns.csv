Gandhi,"Gandhi never wore shoes, so his feet were very rough. He also ate very little, which made him very skinny and weak. He was a devout Hindu, which led him to being seen by many of his followers as a religious leader as well as a political reformer. The few things he ate were usually quite pungent, leading to him having bad breath. Finally, he was also a huge fan of Mary Poppins.

Some puns for you fine people.,"It really grinds my gears when people say stick-shift is obsolete.

When an astronaut drinks tea, he takes a big space-sip.

The only kind of rap I like is the wrapping paper on gifts. 

Scissors always cut straight to the point. 

When working with electricity, always make sure to be grounded to prevent shocking results.

Architecture is an aSpiring career path.

Never argue with people when they are right or nobody will be left hanging out with you.

Cheese puns are grate because you don’t have to ask for parmesan to use them.

Eskimos have cold personality. It is an ice society, but some of their history chills my spine.

My dog died a few years ago. It was really ruff.

Makes sense. If it makes enough sense, it makes dollars.

Teach a man how to make a fire and he will be warm for a night. Light a man on fire and he will be warm for the rest of his life.

With great reflexes comes great response-ability.

If one had previously claimed something, and now no longer does, is that a disclaimer?

When hanging paintings, the perfect wall placement nails it.",14

2: A paper golem bird-lizard that forces you to change which words you're using until defeated.

3: A set of large paper golems with one eye each.

4: A paper Dragon with no wings.

5: Pointy-eared bastards that Silence you whenever you get too loud.

6: A false one of the above. His spells don't work, and his fake ears are attached to his equally fake Pompadour. The jumpsuit's real, though.

7: Tiny water elementals that are dreadfully morose

8: An ornate Treasure Chest that is filled with Undead Electric Bees. How shocking!

9: A bust that fires 6 crossbow bolts per round, and reloads all 6 in one go.

10: A rough-hewn sculpture of a fish-panther

11: Nuts that forecast the weather when consumed

12: Deceptive Clusterfruits (i.e., when you eat them, you're compelled to lie, and others are forced to believe you).

13: If you somehow bring a Pirate into the room containing the snacks above, the room instead contains Freedom Fighters allied with the Pirate.

14: A room that only pole-arm wielders can enter

Pretty sweet post so far, huh? I'd add some more sugar, but you guys would probably be salty, which would be counterproductive. Speaking of counterproductive, I once knew a guy who was like that - he built counters for a living. He was a math teacher. Another guy I know was double-majoring in math and entomology - called himself a mothmetician. Really bugged me at first, but now I realize it's pretty fly.

&#x200B;

Speaking of flying, someone once asked me if I knew any bird puns. I said that there weren't many to s-beak of, but I tried to wing it and post one on twitter. It attracted a lot more puns - real technical, wordy ones. I guess nerds of a feather flock together. One of them tried to Switch things up by talking about video games - no pun Nintendo-ed

adoption,"so basically, when I was young, I was in a bunch of orphan homes and stuff. I never really had any friends or anything, and I pretty much was just waiting for when I turned 18 so I could leave. One day, one of the usual suspects comes in, but he is alone. He is a really rich dude, looking to do the weird homeschool thing in the cool mansion. I still remember the stiff cot under me when he came in. 

""Hey,"" he said   
""hi,"" I said. 

he left immediately, and then came back later. that's all he needed, and I was adopted immediately. I was so happy. we got into his nice Mercedes, and drove off. We stopped at a nearby restaurant, which was the first meal I had had outside the orphanage in years.   
""you hungry?"" he says with his dark shades on

""OMG yes I'm starving"" I reply 

he takes off his shades to reveal a tear in his eye

""Hi starving, I'm dad""",9

Help Me Out with Joke/parody Names for Scratch Cards?,"So you know how scratch cards have individual names like ""Fast 500"", ""Payday"" , ""Neon 9"" etc.? Well, I'm illustrating a graphic novel and one of my panels is going to have a scratch card display in it, and I would like some funny ideas for parody scratch cards.
 
My ideas so far either make light of the gambling aspect of it, or the shady characters that you often see purchasing them, E.G.:

BIG DREAMS

Gypsy Gold!

Gullibl£

Fal$e Hop£

and my personal favourite: $ign Off! (As opposed to Signing On which is to claim benefits/welfare/dole. Idk if the term is used outside of the UK)
