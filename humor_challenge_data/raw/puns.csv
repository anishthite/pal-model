So I was visiting my friend in Boston, and we decided to go to the local pub. We were about to get in his car, when suddenly he curses to himself. I ask him what's wrong, and he says ""I forgot my damn khakis."" Wanting to be a good friend, I said I'd go in and get them, though I found it a little strange. So a minute or two later I come back out with a tan pair of pants, and give them to him. My friend then gave me a look and said, ""Thanks I guess, but how the hell are these gonna get me in my fucking kha?""",0
