2,"Four doves, a crocodile salesmen, and a cum guzzler walked into the cigar shop window, and yelled ""I'm a hipster. I will guzzler your cum!"". A police officer runs up and says...","""I disagree with your candour. Put your hands up and suck me off with no hands, and I will knight the with my baton and pepper spray"".

The hipster backed up, ""Whoah, stop man you're freaking my out"".

The police officer had walked out of view and was getting something out of the trunk of his cruiser. ""Horray!"" - a cheer heard obstructively from behind the raised trunk of his cruiser. ""I found my tutu!"".

 The hipster man slowly stepped down from the shards of glass he had perched upon, beside the entrance of the cigar shop. An intense curiosity burned into his mind, and this curiosity managed to wash away the electric meth haze he had faced moments ago. The hipster gracefully strolled over to the back of the cruiser and that's when he saw it. A glistening pink tutu, woven with the strands of 1000 homeless women's hair, shined brightly under the light illuminating the license plate of the police cruiser.

And that's when the hipster realized - this was no police cruiser. It was a golf cart, and he was on a golf course under the beating hot sun, fully erect holding the putting flagstick, dripping with blood drawn from the neck of a rabid squirrel.

The hipster was a hero, and the manager of the golf course was awarding him a free hotdog, wearing the tutu made from 1000 Pizza hut cashiers.",0
3,One day there was a train conductor going about his day...,"Having conducted trains for over 20 years, today was just like any other day. 

He pulled up to a stop and gently brought the train to a halt . As the doors open, passengers enter. He goes to close the doors and as he does an old man is slowly racing for the train.

He trips, falling onto the tracks.

Seeing this, the conductor snaps, and drives the train over the old man.

2 years pass. The conductor is sitting on death row, moments before he is due to be electrocuted. A guard comes in, and asks what he would like for his last meal?

“Just one banana.” Says the man. 

The guard is confused.

“You can have anything, sir.” Says the guard. 

“The finest banana you can find.” Says the man. 

A few moments pass, and the guard approaches the conductors cell.

“One banana. The best I could find.”

And so, the conductor proceeds to eat the banana. Extremely slowly. He peels off the skin, those little dangly bits, and eventually every last bit.

“Are you finished?” Says the guard.

“Yes” says the man.

He is taken to the electric chair. There is priest praying on behalf of the man. And once the word is given, a guard presses a button and engages the shock.

Nothing happens.


The mans lawyer is there. He argues that the man has received his punishment.

He wins this case, and is set free.

*

Years pass, the man is, somehow, back behind the console of a large train. Significantly older now.

It’s a normal day, and he is driving the train. As he comes to a halt and let’s passengers on, a young pregnant woman is rushing to make the train. She trips onto the tracks.

The conductor snaps, and runs over the lady.

A year has passed. The man is, again, on death row awaiting electrocution. A guard approached the cell.

“What’ll it be?” The guard says. 

“One banana please.” Says the man. 

“Again?” Says the guard. 

“The finest banana you can find.” Says the man.

Sure enough, the guard returns shortly after with an amazing banana. It’s shiny and fresh and better than before. 

The man takes his time to eat the banana, slowly peeling back the skin and finishing it off.

“Ready” says the guard.

“Yes.” Says the man.

Just like before, the man is taken to an even better electric chair. He is strapped in 10 times tighter with double the connections.

“He won’t get away this time” says the head guard.

They press a button, sending a lethal amount of electricity to the man, but yet again fails to kill him.

“How can this be happening!” They all exclaim.

And because the laws in this region are broken, the man is again free to go.

*


A few months later, the man has escaped to a far part of the world. Managing to hide his identity and get a job as a train conductor.

He’s driving along one day, just as normal, he’s extremely old now and can barely see.  

All of a sudden, someone jumps in front of the train.

Despite it being an accident, because of his track record the man is again sent to death row.

The time has come, it’s a year later, decades before the first time and the man is in the exact same cell as before.

“I don’t know how this keeps happening. But here is your banana.” The guard says.

“Thank you.” Says the man.

It’s now the moment of truth, if this does not work a third time the man has beaten the system and once again sent free.

He’s sitting in the electric chair, the priest cannot bring himself to say a prayer to this monster. Every guard in the prison is surrounding the man as he is strapped into the chair in every way possible.

The head guard walks over to the control panel, sweat dripping down his face. Everyone is looking at him, anxiously awaiting the moment the life leaves the mans eyes.

He presses a button.

Nothing.....


......


“HOW ARE YOU STILL ALIVE?” Says the guard in a rage of confusion. 

The man sits still, and looks the guard straight in his eyes, and finally opens his mouth after a long moment and says: 

“I’m just not a very good conductor.”",0

21,Advanced Technology Machines Are Empowering & Spreading The NCOV COVID19 Faster,"**Advanced Technology Machines Are Empowering & Spreading The NCOV COVID19 Faster**

***From:*** [***https://theworld.data.blog/2020/02/25/advanced-technology-machines-are-empowering-spreading-the-ncov-covid19-faster/***](https://theworld.data.blog/2020/02/25/advanced-technology-machines-are-empowering-spreading-the-ncov-covid19-faster/)

I am not speculating or guessing, I am  using the feeling immortals sense and giving you guys the truth of this  epidemic event so you guys can prevent it.

Science cannot measure Nature, that is for sure. The smaller entity cannot judge the bigger one.

**Can you answer the following questions about the NCOV COVID19:**

1. What is the source and the birth of the virus?

2. Why the virus are spreading so fast?

3. But why some nations spreading fast, why some nations are not?

My statement still do not change, the  advanced technology especially the 5G network are empowering the NCOV  and have a huge contribution into the birth of this virus.

The only reason explain why some nations  next to China like Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia but do not get that virus  spreading fast is they are “out-date” technology. Why the farer nations  with advanced technology are record many more cases everyday.

**In Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos:** There are no high-end trains, no commercial 5G network, no fingerprint/face regconical at border airport.

**What about China, Korea, Singapore, Japan?** Too many public advanced technology sharing devices like bullet train, 5G network, fingerprint biometrics, etc.

I remind all of you that, there are 70%  SARS in the NCOV COVID19, which mean air condition will only help  spreading the virus, including public trains, airport.

I highly recommend all the so call  scientist do the experiment about the connection of the NCOV COVID19  with the 4G, 5G network and the electric devices.

They can put the NCOV COVID19 in the  environment with 5G, 4G, 3G, 2G, and none and observe the virus  everyday, and they will receive the answer whether or not there is a  huge connection with mobile network with the NCOV COVID19.

They should try to put that virus and find  out what surface what objects the NCOV “love”: technology devices,  cloth, sand/clay, etc.

Many nations are not using common feeling sense but rely on broken technology and digging their own grave.

I have made predictions about the collapse of advanced technology nation at least 1-2 years ago, then now it become reality.

If the China, Korea, Japan, Singapore,  Israel, etc. do not stop all the 4G, 5G network, air condition on public  train and stop the fingerprint/biometrics collection on border then  they will all gone within the next 60 days for sure.

**If you cannot prove my statement are wrong, then it must be true.**

**Stop asking me about tiny science  proof evidence for science cannot record many things, including the  super small seed of the NCOV COVID19 !!!**

Best Regard,

**The Savior**",0
22,What did five fingers say to the face.,"First you must understand that fingers stem from the hand, they have nerve endings connecting all the way through the spinal chord to the brain... the brain of course has a mind capable of responding to patterns, feeling emotion and rationalizing and making decisions. But does it make decisions? What is consciousness? Let’s say we do have free will, are we not influenced by our surroundings? And suppose we do use our brain to communicate with that hand of ours. If we stared at it long enough could we gain insight in a way as if communicating with it?

But does the hand have free will? Does the mind? Do any of us? What does it really mean?

And as I sat there pondering the meaning of life I came to think that one could know the secrets of the universe through introspection with a simple question and various ponderings while staring at that hand. 

And in a single moment my life flashed before my eyes and I came to realize that the hand I was staring at was not my own, that I was in a catatonic state the last 5 hours and I was staring down the hand of a friend who was trying to get me to snap out of this state as the world seemed to stop and I say their frozen. Then it appeared the hand was coiled back as if to lunge sideways across the air. And I realized that perhaps we are all just air filled with individual molecules mostly made up of air with atoms mostly made of air and subatomic particles exhibiting quantum properties like the photon which is able to be in two places at once and constantly moving the same speed relative to the observer and thus perhaps it is in two places at once and two places in space time and if consciousness and time relative to that light changes, perhaps light contains multidimensional properties and is everywhere at once.

And if light is an omnipotent, omnipresent nature to all things, perhaps we are all interconnected through the light. And Jesus said behold I am the truth and the light, so perhaps we are all one and religion as science can merge into an ever-present awareness of the self in its relationship to each other and the universe.

Just then I saw that hand staring at my face, and I felt warm... for I felt as if I knew the secrets to the universe, consciousness, quantum field theory and life itself.... all from a single hand which had just approach my face.

And in that moment I was connected to the everpresent existence to our quantumly entangled world and I felt the presence of the Logos. The word used for Jesus but also a concept meaning word and reason. And I had discovered my true nature as an eternal being within this universe. Behold for as my face is one with the universe... the hand... 

And then it hit me.

I know! What the five fingers as one with the hand in a greater fractal pattern interconnected with fractals of cell’s which connect with fractal of molecules which are a branch of atoms which are a branch of layers of charged and uncharged energy below in patterns of subatomic and quantum level. I know what the five fingers said to the face! I knew it! And I not only knew it! I lived it! 
I was experiencing it now and it was beutiful. And then I felt the five fingers as a giant network of the universe interlaced through a quantum field interlacing with the blueprint of all matter... and as the five fingers communicated in this way I thought I heard something... it’s a sound that if we listen to the five fingers and hand talking to the face from the fractal pattern of our earth to the solar system down to the atom and up to the galexy from the minute to the gargantuan size of the universe itself and through the interconnected cosmic energy causing the ripple effect of the air vibrating the hairs on our outer ear drum and vibrating the inner ear being translated through the brain and from the brain which processes it all we can hear it as well. We can hear the five fingers saying to the face the inner workings of the universe. 

In conclusion, as I was pondering this wonderful magnificent feeling, I felt a pain of the five fingers for I was jarred from this infinite bliss and shocked back into reality. And the only thing I knew at that time was the hand and the face, but no longer in a metaphysical way but more of a “physical” way. And despite all of what I had said, at this moment the five fingers said to the face something and I heard and felt it in my face.

the five fingers said to the face....

He bellowed across to the individual to stop filming him.

The bystander shook their head vigorously and yelled back that they will upload the video to YouTube ""so that everybody can know what a bad man you are"".

Homelander bellowed back that the bystander was a ""stupid bitch"" and that they looked ""like a fucking whore"" (Homelander's words).

The bystander was visibly shocked and protested that they were extremely offended and that they were ""proud to be transgender"". Homelander then zipped across the street and smashed the bystander's iPhone and then flew away.

Another bystander had been filming the altercation from behind his Buick and promptly uploaded it to Twitter, YouTube and Facebook amongst other sites.

The bystander (the one who identified as a woman) was later interviewed by several large media outlets and the story became front-page news and even overtook coverage of Presidential impeachment hearings. The scandal then made global news after the now-nationally famous bystander apparently ""spontaneously combusted"" live on-air during an interview with MSNBC.

The bystander's family sued Homelander and Vought International for US$17m and US$23m respectively.

Since an atom consists of at least one electron, that means that after some time that electron will come to an end.
