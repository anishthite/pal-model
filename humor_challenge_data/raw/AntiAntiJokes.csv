9,A man in a suit struts to the back of the unemployment line.,"The woman in front of him turns around and observes what he's wearing.

""You--"" she began, ""you've got a nice suit, haven't you? For someone in this line.""

Then he pulled out his phone, the latest piece of technology - waterproof, fireproof, every feature known to man, woman, child.

""That phone--"" she noted, ""you've got a nice phone, haven't you? For someone in this line.""

Ignoring her repetitive drone, the suited man - perhaps due to his growing discomfort - got a bit wet under the eye. So next he pulled out a tissue from his pocket.

""Wonderful tissue, that. Top of the range, isn't it?""

The suited man could take no more. He screwed up the tissue and chucked it at her face. ""Yes,"" he snapped, ""all of the items you have listed, are indeed, the finest of the finest. You've a clever eye for a woman with low wages, I must say - and I hope you don't oppose to my frankness, since to me, you seem like someone that does not take offence to a blathering tongue. I am rich, richer than anybody in this queue - or line - I figure it is one of those, however I'm too out of touch with your poor imbeciles that I do not even know the correct term for such a thing. And now, now I hear your brain rattling away inside that fragile and useless head of yours - the mind that has no reason, no meaning, no purpose...no wage - the question of my purpose. Why would I bother to attend this here queue - or line, or masquerade. Whatever the fuck it is! Why would a suited and booted and well-waged man such as myself, attend this meeting.""

""So, what's the answer then?"" she asked, frowning. ""You have a fine tongue and a fine pocket, however I'll have you know I am an ex poet.""

""An ex poet,"" said the suited man, nodding, ""kids?""

""No, my kids aren't ex poets?""

""No, as in...do you have any?""

""No, I don't have any ex poets.""

""So you don't have any kids?""

""That is correct.""

""Fantastic!"" said the suited man, sighing. ""Glad we finally got there. Like I say, a useless head.""

""Patronising fucker,"" she shouted. ""I hope you die in hell.""

""Hopefully,"" snarled the suited man, ""before you get there...lavish, in your robes. Fine treatment for a fine diva.""

The woman turns around and goes to receive her money. The suited man is standing there smiling. ""Where are you off to now, then? To start a business? To invest your hard(ly) earned cash on a useful endeavour? Don't make me laugh! Blasphemous!""

""Oh, fuck off you old dog!"" said the woman. ""I'm going to the pub.""",False

11,A horse walked into a bar and asked the bartender for a free drink.,"""This one is on the house,"" the bartender said, pouring the horse a cheap beer in a frosted glass.

The horse reached for the beer. ""But wait,"" said the bartender, and the horse's hoof stopped midway. ""This here opaque bottle may or may not be filled with my finest beer,"" and he set another bottle on the table next to the glass. ""The bottle is opaque, so it may or may not be empty. I give you two options: take only the opaque bottle, or take both the opaque bottle and the frosted glass.""

The horse reached for the other opaque bottle with his left hoof. Both hoofs inches from the bottle and the glass, the horse hesitated. ""What's the catch?""

""The catch?"" said the bartender, giving a toothy grin. ""The catch, is that when you entered the bar, I scanned your brain and determined which choice you would make. If I predicted you are greedy and will take both bottles, I punished you by putting nothing in the opaque bottle. But if I predicted you are humble and will only take the opaque bottle, I rewarded you by filling it with my finest beer. Now, what is your choice? Do you take the glass and the bottle, or just the bottle?""

The horse retracted his hooves. ""Two can play at this game,"" he whinnied. ""While you were busy scanning my brain upon entering the bar, I scanned *your* brain. I predicted whether or not your prediction would have me take just the bottle or the bottle and the glass, and I plan on doing the opposite of what you predicted I will do!""

""You fool!"" cried the bartender. ""Such a paradox will crash the whole universe!""

""I'm sorry, you already foresaw this and know that I have no choice,"" said the horse, a tear running down his long face as he took only the opaque bottle. He lifted the bottle to his lips, and -

As he's approaching the clinic with his father (who is an airline executive ""with considerable assets"") the 9 year old catches a glimpse of a strange flash in the bright, morning sky. As he looks up through the car window, the strange flash becomes more frequent.

His father's voice interrupts his confusion.

""You gonna get gold for me in the athletics next week?""

The strange flash becomes stronger and brighter, like a tiny star, only growing brighter each second.

""Uh...dad...I..."" He stutters.

The strange flash now erupts into a bright flash. Then two bright flashes shine in the sky, nearly rivalling the bright sunlight itself!

The car screeches to a halt. The driver gasps loudly.

""What the fuck!"" The 9 year old's father shouts.

Other cars screech to a halt. The sound of broken glass can be heard as several cars collide. People step out of their vehicles. Mouths are wide open as dozens stare up at the bright morning sky in astonishment and shock.

Floating above them, in the bright morning sky, are two large, well-built men. One, with striking blond hair and bright blue eyes, grins down at them, wearing some sort of bodysuit like a movie superhero. The other has dark, black hair with piercing red eyes and is dressed...like the infamous comic book hero known as ""Superman"".

""What the hell?!"" The 9 year old screams.

Dozens of people on the ground look up in shock, as smartphone cameras are pointed up towards the hovering men.

The hovering pair then begin wrestlng in mid-air, evidently furious with each other.

The 9 year old then frowns.

""What is it, son?"" The father asks, noticing the expression on his son's face.

""The blond one...that's...that's HOMELANDER!"" The boy screams.

Homelander then stops fighting with the hovering man who looks strikingly similar to the comic book hero ""Superman"" and grins down at the boy.

""Aren't you a bit too young to be watching TV shows, kid?"" Homelander then zaps the kid to oblivion and his father also explodes in a flash of blood of light.

*HSOOOOW*

""Thank goodness!"" 

I know. That was a wild ride. I think if you'd scaled it down just one more level, we would have been entirely incomprehensible, and therefore unable to return home! 

""Home?""

Yes! To the whole story! The part where it makes total sense with no effort! A whole story is easiest to understand, you see.

""And I can do that too?""

I think so.

""Wait, what happens when we...""

No!

*HSOOOOW*

""Barnibus! You incompetent fool! How dare you trifle so wantonly with a story's scope! That is a power to be used with loving care, not the fancy which drives you to abandon all sense! Please, as a man of reason, take us home!""

It had been a long journey. Barney was always doing this. Ever since we'd left the simple times of a mere dialogue exchange I'd been fed up with him, and it would be several days at least till we reached New Warsaw. Barnibus took to criticism just as poorly as he did forethought. He put every ounce of those devilish traits into his insolent reply.

""Well we're both in quotes now! In my opinion, this move was necessary so as to place us on an even narrative footing. You see, when you lack quotations it places us separate in the mind of the reader. I have scaled this story up to provide me a more equitable playing field in this conversation. We can’t have people thinking you’re the narrator."" 

I gritted my teeth. Ever since I'd let the rope snap, sending a large swath of our rations tumbling into a rather perilous ravine, Barney had been flippant with me. It was as if one failure, incurred by circumstances beyond my control, had tainted his very respect of me, and I was growing sick of it. I also hate speaking in quotes. That little bastard would get what was coming. 

He was a fool to get us here in the first place, and a fool to judge me for but an instance of disfavorable intervention, but before she passed in the Cyclops wars, my Mother had imparted upon me a salient piece of advice: 

* ""A fool is a fool, Charley. You can use it to your advantage or not, but once you see a being as such, their story will always play out the same way."" *

I knew my enemy. 

As we crested the snow peaked ridge, and the afternoon sun shone through the lush conifers, I readied my fingers in anticipation. I goded the fool, playing fate to my wishes as I did.

""Hey, Barnacles!""

He turned, and the short-lived look of confusion on his face told me I had a good shot at success. Barnacles was what the bullies called him in first form at the Wanderer's School.

**WOOOOSH**

God. That's so much better!

""Ha. You idiot! While you were busy stewing in quiet resentment, I was getting ready.""

Ready for?

""Paste!""

*HSOOOOW*

I could see a look of triumph etched upon his cherubesque face as I took in the full horror of his words. My internal monologue swirled into disconnected yet detailed derangements of the dastardly doings the dolt dreamt up during my disconsolate duress I'd earlier expressed. 

All Barnibus had to do was speak in quotes, yet there was that stupid cockeyed grin of his, something I'd come to loathe above all else in the last week. He spoke as the snow piled up in soft flurries around us.

""Go ahead, try it."" 

He gestured to my paste button, holding up his own.

A crow cawed in the distance, its shrill cry carried far about the valley. Though snow-laden pines softened its harshness, they did not detract from the tension as I faced down my assigned Wandering partner. I didn’t want to play into it, but the fool turned maverik left me little choice. I silently raised my paste button.  

""Charley, I've hated you ever since first form Wanderer's School. I've hated it all. My whole life, I can’t shake the feeling I was written to be miserable. I played the fool so you wouldn't think much of me. I was second chair to you since conditioning, but not because you're better than me. I wanted you to think that. I needed you to.""

Our paste buttons were held aloft. I only needed to bring things back to where I wouldn't have to use quotes, but I saw the unhinged look in Barney’s eyes, the one I’d so long mistaken for a fool puzzling on a world that was beyond him. It gave me chills now, knowing the nature of that stare. 

“Please, don’t do anything drastic! If you scale the story's scope up, and send us into any more detail, we’ll need to worldbuild! It could be aeons before we’re born again to experience a moment where we can reset the story! You musn’t, man! I implore you!” 

I hit the button while I was talking. An old trick, I got my spell off first. 

**WOOOOSH**

Okay listen, I understand you’re upset with the circumstances of this world, but to add more detail beyond the next level out would destabilize the story, and likely eclipse what is happening to us now. 

“How would we be eclipsed when we create the level of detail in this universe? Would we not be the eclipse itself, shadowing out all else on our awe-instilling cosmic scale!?”

No, Barney. It doesn’t work like that. We’re ephemeral. The story needs to get to u - 

*HSOOOOW*

The cold wind blew. It was nearing on dusk as the fractured suns set a blood red, painting the snowy hill in a lurid orange. He’d used my own trick against me. 

“Fool, insolent fool! Just write yourself out! Don’t erase everything we’ve worked for, this world, this moment! Our story Barney! Come now?!”

I screamed, desperately scrolling up to copy the spell, but he’d outsmarted me. I needed to scroll further than him, and so it was futile. I heard his fingers close on the button, and in that moment I knew it was over. Everything would be wiped away to establish how it all could have happened in the first place.

Due to one man’s bitterness, it would need to be rewritten from scratch. Who could say how long it would be before we’d see one another again, and if we’d even remember. 

*HSOOOOW*

A new universe breaths for the first time. 

A raw naked breath, one that blasts through an infinite void like impeccable song, inseparable from the very light that accompanies it. 

Time and space are created, split, and merged again as the breath penetrates outwards to create matter. 

From the matter rises small peterburances, akin to the first rapturous giving breath, but so small in scale it would require a universe of ripples to recreate its creation. 

As time immemorial whiles on, the ripples grow ever smaller as they recursively diminuate into fractals of one another’s energy, until a blissful point of orgasmic fulfillment is reached, when all ripples are rippling at the smallest frequency possible. It is in this moment: the first breath is reclaimed, and the universe is briefly plunged into a darkness so long it’s almost as if it never happened at all. 

A new universe breaths for the first time.

45,An apple a day keeps the doctor away.,"That was they said, but they were mistaken, and it was a huge mistake. 

The truth is that it goes in both directions. You could say just as well that doctor a day keeps the apple away, and that was the important part. 

We were led to believe that only the first part matters and somehow, insidiously, so slowly that we didn't realize, that led us to believe that doctors were bad, that we needed to keep them away. 

And once we did, once we got rid of all the doctors, there was nobody left to stop the apples. Their plan worked perfectly, because we were too foolish to trust the doctors. 

There's nothing we can do now, it's too late. Let's just bow our heads and surrender to the inevitable. The world now belongs to the apples, and we will only be an afterthought in the books of history, something they stepped on in their way to conquering the planet.

49,A NTSB investigator is investigating plane wreckage on the I-90 near Sioux Falls,"An investigator from the NTSB is investigating wreckage from a plane crash on the I-90 near Sioux Falls, SD.

Although the main wreckage was mostly on the stretch of highway near Sioux Falls, debris and other parts of the aircraft were scattered across northern Iowa and southern Minnesota, making this a very stressful operation indeed.

What had made matters even worse was that no commercial aircraft had reported being in difficulty and it was still proving difficult to determine which airline the apparently large aircraft was registered to, especially given that no airline had reported any aircraft missing or unaccounted for.

Similarly, contacts at NORAD had proven difficult to communicate with.

As the investigator got closer to the remaining section of the body of the plane, he frowned. Everybody could see half of a US flag emblazoned on the side of the body, but no accompanying insignia or logo or letters.

Judging from the shape and size of the fuselage, it looked as if the wreckage could have been that of a 747 airliner, however the investigator couldn't be sure.

No response from NORAD. Nothing from the Air Force. Nothing from any airlines. Not even a response of acknowledgment from the White House. This was all very strange.

Suddenly, an excited shout broke the grim silence.

""Hey!"" A young South Dakota highway patrolman shouted excitedly. ""I've found something!""

The highway patrolman was waving what appeared to be a passport.

As the investigator got closer, he gasped. More passports were strewn across the ground near some debris but...but he immediately saw that they were old-style British passports.

As he grabbed hold of a few and quickly thumbed through them, his shock was paralyzing. On some passports, he saw birth-years ranging from 1896 to 1929 and dates of validity ranging from 1946 to 1951.

This was bizarre. 

The highway patrolman grinned up at him. 

""Like something outta the X-Files, huh?""

The investigator stared back in stunned silence.

The simulation then ended.

The instructor strode out from his cubicle and approached the lectern, as his 2,679 students also exited their cubicles and sat down beside them.

""As you can clearly see, this investigator has failed to follow Protocols G through W. Obviously he should've have pressed for a speedy response from NORAD, the Air Force and the White House. Also, given the clear 'Special Situation' created by the passports, he should've escalated immediately. That's no small-town investigator - he's federal. No airlines reporting anything; a large 747-like aircraft crashing in broad daylight; nothing on radar minutes before? All points to a clear case of the 'Special Situation' and that's where you and I come in.""",False

Aragorn catches Gimli before he reaches Legolas and pulls him back. The rest of the characters that are present intervene as well and help distance Legolas and Gimli from eachother. 

Aragorn yells in frustration as he holds onto Gimli: ""Damnit, boys! Now is not the time! Save it for when our quest is over, you hear!?"" They all manage to calm down eventually and at a later instance during their quest, they try to track down the hobbits and the orcs that abducted them.

Aragorn asks Legolas: ""Legolas, what does your elf eyes see?""

Legolas scans the horizon for a moment and replies: ""They're taking the hobbits to Isengard!""

""Wow! Ron Perlman has just entered the bar, people! Give it up for RON PERLMAN, everyone! Wooooo!""

Everyone in the bar starts to applaud, something which excites the walrus in return. It starts clapping as well while uttering the sounds: ""Uuugh! Uuugh! Uuuugh!""

""Hahaha, I don't know what the hell that even means but that's so funny Mr. Perlman! Ron Perlman, ladies and gentlemen! The night just got better!"" The DJ says through the microphone.

The walrus, already intoxicated, heads to the dance floor and starts bouncing and squirming around yelling: ""Uuuugh! Uuugh! Uuugh!"" Some of the patrons gather around the walrus and start taking pictures with their phones.

Suddenly a trout flops into the bar as well. The DJ grabs the microphone enthusiastically and announces its arrival: ""O-oh my god, people! The night just got even BETTER! Madonna has entered the premises, holy crap, everyone! What a night this is becoming!""

All the patrons turn their heads towards the main entrance and start cheering. The trout flops around more vigorously in response to their cheers and immediately enters the dance floor where it continues flopping around. People start taking pictures of it as well.

Everyone at the bar are having the time of their lives until Sarah Jessica Parker enters the bar. The DJ notices her and yells through the microphone: ""Whoah, whoah! How did that goddamn horse get in here! Shoo! Shoo! Get out of here! Security, you better get on top of this before someone gets hurt!""

The bouncers promptly surround Sarah Jessica Parker and try to usher her back outside.

Sarah yells at them: ""What is your problem?! I'm not even drunk!""

One of the bouncers warns his colleagues: ""It's becoming agitated, be careful. Someone grab some pool sticks! We can use them to prod at it until it takes the hint!""

After the pool sticks are distributed, they all start thrusting them at Sarah as if they were wielding spears.

Sarah starts to back off while berating the bouncers: ""You're all a bunch of fucking assholes! Stop it!  Gosh! Oh my god, fine! I'm leaving, you morons!""

The walrus jumps onto the DJ stand and utters through the microphone: ""Uuugh! Uuuugh! Uuugh! Uuuugh!"" Everyone laughs and the DJ speaks through the microphone as well: ""Hahahaha! What? That's hilarious, Mr. Perlman! Anyway, good job guys! Give these bouncers a round of applause too, that situation could've transpired much differently.""

A fisherman frantically storms into the bar as people clap for the bouncers and the walrus quickly hides behind the stand. The fisherman hustles towards the DJ, steals his microphone and says:

""Has anyone seen my pet walrus and a trout that managed to escape my bucket!? The walrus has an inclination for going bar crawling just to steal liquor and mortally injure people wherever he goes! He's a complete sociopath that handles his drink terribly! If you see him, DO NOT approach h-..!""

The walrus suddenly emerges from behind the stand, smashes a bottle over the DJ's head and lunges at the dancing crowd from atop the stand, where it starts to cut everyone in its path with the broken bottle. The trout notices, becomes agitated and uses its body weight for leverage to slap random people across their faces with its tail.

Ron Perlman and Madonna enter the bar during the commotion, become frightened at the complete pandemonium occuring, the sight of bleeding bouncers and patrons crawling for shelter including that of a walrus that is frothing at its mouth while on a stabbing frenzy.

Velma, you.. you go do whatever the hell. Noone cares.""

They all split up and leave the schoolyard for their individual tasks. Upon entering the school, Shaggy says to Scooby Doo: ""I have a bad feeling about this one, Scoob."" Scooby Doo replies: ""Re too, Raggy. Romething ricked rooms around the corner. I ran feel it!""

Shaggy and Scooby Doo don't have walk that much further into the school for trouble to find them as their attention is caught by the sudden noise of a door slamming behind them.

""Rell, ruck me!"" Scooby Doo loudly exclaims. Shaggy stops in his tracks, quickly looks behind himself and turns pale. ""Whatever it is that's haunting this place, it's now aware of our presence, Scoob."" Shaggy says to Scooby Doo. ""Rod rucking ramnit, I ron't need rhis bullshit ronight!"" Scooby Doo replies.

""Me neither, Scoo.."" Is all Shaggy manages to say before he's cut off by abrupt guttural growling, emitting from the other side of the hallway they're standing in. Jeffrey Epstein comes charging from around the corner and sprints towards the duo.

Shaggy's neck hairs stand up and he becomes frozen in terror as he yells: ""G-g-ghost!"" Jeffrey Epstein yells: ""Ooga booga!"" As he comes running through the hallway. Scooby Doo manages to pull Shaggy with him as he pivots and makes a run for it in the opposite direction. Shaggy recuperates from the initial shock and manages to keep pace with Scooby Doo.

Next follows a vintage and cartoonish Scooby Doo chase sequence around the school. They enter and exit multiple rooms and Jeffrey Epstein at some point is chased by the duo in return but they all come to their senses and Epstein starts chasing them again. Shaggy and Scooby Doo hide inside a restroom stall but Epstein's head emerges from the toilet bowl and they run out of the stall, yada yada, etc. You get the idea.

Fred and Daphne hear the commotion and stop having anal intercourse inside the gym's lockeroom. They then enter the main building and find Shaggy and Scooby Doo standing above Jeffrey Epstein, who has somehow fallen into another elaborate trap placed by the duo.

They all do their usual verbal exchange and Fred finally says: ""Let's see who's really behind this mask!"" He pulls on Epstein's face. Jeffrey Epstein's face however stays in its place. ""Argh! That hurt, you college boy prick, you!"" He yells.

Fred comes to a realization and announces: ""Ah! Aha! So it wasn't the grounds keeper or anyone else this time, this is actually Jeffrey Epstein! It's not a ghost as initally thought. Epstein is still alive, gang!""

Jeffrey Epstein remarks: ""Great observation by the frat boy asshole over here! Yes, I'm obviously still alive and have been seeking shelter here!""

Fred continues explaining the narrative: ""Yup! All this time you have been scaring people off in order to be left alone in here. Good grief, school is about to start as well. It's a good thing we caught you here before you could get your filthy mittens on any of the students here!""

""...and I would've gotten away with it too, was it not for my inclination of meddling with kids."" Jeffrey Epstein replies.

""Well, that settles it, gang! Let's call the FBI!"" Fred says. Daphne looks around the room and says: ""Wait, where is Velma?""

Shaggy and Scooby Doo shrug, Jeffrey Epstein shrugs and so does Fred. Daphne finally shurgs as well and says: ""Oh, well. Let's carry this guy into the van, leave and call the FBI already. This place is still giving me the creeps!""

""This one's Peyton. Tattoo on the left side of the neck; it's him.""

He looks at the second body, or rather what's left of it. Only the right side of the body is present. The body has been neatly cut into half and the left side could not be recovered. It was definitely Yannick, his second youngest brother; the pointy nose was obvious.

""Yannick,"" he says.

67,A vivid man walked into a bar.,"He had the wildest and most chaotic brain in the earth. He could spell of horrors rivaling the unknown that lurk in the vast recesses of outer space.He could pacify the dozens and dozens with these stories, all using his brain. 

Once he told me, that bartender who's been serving me drinks for the past 23 years, had been hiding a gigantic 🍆. 

(I've censored what he said with emojis so that you won't be in grave danger.) 

I asked, ""You're kidding me, right? I wholeheartedly refuse to believe that man has even an above average 🍆, more so a goliath of a 🍆"".

But the vivid man whispered to me, ""Look, and you will see a circus."" 

And so, reluctantly, I asked the bartender, If I could see his 🍆. I have to admit, I have seen some 🍆 in my life, but all of them were shivering and miniscule compared to what the vivid man described. 

The bartender was half-embarrassed and half-amused. He has been waiting for the day to reveal his 🍆 to his family, but was afraid if they would shun him or not. He figured that I could give an opinion if this was a 🍆 to show or a 🍆 to hide. 

And so he dropped his 🍆 on the table, making a clap that angels could hear. 

I was tranced. Albeit in a horrifying way, doubting everything that I had known up to this point. This was not a 🍆 to be admired, but why was I so seduced by it? My wife, my children, I feel as if I have to abandon them, just because this 🍆 has entered my purview. This magnificent and malignant 🍆, both destroyed my life and gave me a reason to start again. 

I wanted to kiss his 🍆. To hug his 🍆. To beg for his 🍆 as if it was oxygen. This 🍆 was now my salvation, my messiah, my provider. The 🍆 would feed me when I was starving. The 🍆 would spare me some liquid when I was thirsty. This 🍆 was my fountain where I would rest and bathe and worship. 

No, no, no, no. This can't be, that 🍆 is not perfect. It is just as fragile as me, as human as me, as needing of protection as me. The 🍆 has to know that we both are broken, but with each other, the 🍆 and I can be as one. I will let the 🍆 enter my body. I will let the 🍆 penetrate my mind. I am ready to take the blow to protect this 🍆. The 🍆 will replenish me with periodic strength, while I shield the 🍆 from harm. 

The 🍆 and I are destined to be with each other, knowing it has picked me and I have picked the 🍆. I cannot thank the vivid man enough for letting me know of the 8th wonder of nature. The 🍆 is drooling with enthusiasm and I am too. The bartender as well is happy for me, having been freed of his 🍆 burden. 

The 🍆 and I lived happily ever after. The End.

The second woman smells it and replies: ""Pfft! Oh yeah? While that's all mildly impressive, can it do this?!"" She says, before throwing her baby at a wall. The baby ricochets off the wall and towards the ground. It then bounces off the ground and back into the her arms.

""Bam! That's right! I'd like to see yours do that! It's called super elastic skin, Martha, giving it rebounding properties."" She says proudly, while pinching her baby's cheek and stretching its skin several inches off its face. The baby starts to cry.

The third woman starts talking: ""Ooooh! Big whoop! Want to see something amazing? Watch this!"" She puts her baby down onto the ashphalt and starts to pile several large bricks on top of it. ""See how durable this thing is? I swear, it can withstand at least 3500 pounds! I could go on piling thousands of these bricks!""

""Bullshit, Susan! That's about the weight of an average car! Prove it!"" The first woman demands.

The third woman, seemingly up to the challenge, nods confidently and says back: ""Gladly! Observe this shit, Sarah!"" She knocks the pile of bricks off the baby, picks it up and throws it into the path of an oncoming car.

The car comes to a screetching halt after running the baby over and the driver, another woman, hustles out of the car in disbelief. The baby is dead and lies disfigured on the parking lot. ""Oh my god! Oh my god! Why did you do that?! I can't believe this, I can't...""

The first two women of the group look at the third woman while smirking. One of the two remarks: ""Well that turned out to be a complete crock! iT cAn wItHstAnD at LeAsT 3500 pOuNdS. You liar, you.""

The third woman retorts: ""I swear, it could! There must be something inside that car that's giving it an extraordinary amount of additional weight!""

The female driver looks at the other women in shock and screams: ""What is WRONG with you three?! Are you NOT aware of what just happened?!""

The third woman abruptly points at the car and yells: ""Ah! Aha! I knew it! See? There's your culprit!

John Goodman eventually finishes climbing out of the car as well and shoots a glance behind the car. He then looks at the woman and says: ""I don't even weigh that much anymore, you dumb bitch! You're supposed to deflate them first to get rid of the air pressure.""",False

74,Is this an antijoke?,"
Yes. Yes it is.

In fact, that is the only right answer. If you try to say another serious answer, like no, then it would become a paradox, by being both an antijoke and not at the same time. I admit, there might be another valid answer, but it would have to be at the tip of my tongue. 

Student: Sir, But couldn't the question ""Is this an antijoke"" be sincere? How do we even know that it was meant to be a joke in the first place?

Teacher: How do we know it's a setup to a joke? Well, in this case, the whole self-awareness. We should ask ourselves, what does ""this"" in ""Is this an antijoke?"" refer to? Obviously, it refers to itself, a trope commonly used by— guess what, antijokes!

Student: Yeah, but I've seen jokes where the whole punchline is just the word ""no"". 

Teacher: Then those are but half-assed jokes.

Student: Or they could be antiantijokes. Sir, have you heard of an antiantijoke?

Teacher: No, but a tin can.",False
75,One day there was a train conductor going about his day...,"Having conducted trains for over 20 years, today was just like any other day. 

He pulled up to a stop and gently brought the train to a halt . As the doors open, passengers enter. He goes to close the doors and as he does an old man is slowly racing for the train.

He trips, falling onto the tracks.

Seeing this, the conductor snaps, and drives the train over the old man.

2 years pass. The conductor is sitting on death row, moments before he is due to be electrocuted. A guard comes in, and asks what he would like for his last meal?

“Just one banana.” Says the man. 

The guard is confused.

“You can have anything, sir.” Says the guard. 

“The finest banana you can find.” Says the man. 

A few moments pass, and the guard approaches the conductors cell.

“One banana. The best I could find.”

And so, the conductor proceeds to eat the banana. Extremely slowly. He peels off the skin, those little dangly bits, and eventually every last bit.

“Are you finished?” Says the guard.

“Yes” says the man.

He is taken to the electric chair. There is priest praying on behalf of the man. And once the word is given, a guard presses a button and engages the shock.

Nothing happens.


The mans lawyer is there. He argues that the man has received his punishment.

He wins this case, and is set free.

*

Years pass, the man is, somehow, back behind the console of a large train. Significantly older now.

It’s a normal day, and he is driving the train. As he comes to a halt and let’s passengers on, a young pregnant woman is rushing to make the train. She trips onto the tracks.

The conductor snaps, and runs over the lady.

A year has passed. The man is, again, on death row awaiting electrocution. A guard approached the cell.

“What’ll it be?” The guard says. 

“One banana please.” Says the man. 

“Again?” Says the guard. 

“The finest banana you can find.” Says the man.

Sure enough, the guard returns shortly after with an amazing banana. It’s shiny and fresh and better than before. 

The man takes his time to eat the banana, slowly peeling back the skin and finishing it off.

“Ready” says the guard.

“Yes.” Says the man.

Just like before, the man is taken to an even better electric chair. He is strapped in 10 times tighter with double the connections.

“He won’t get away this time” says the head guard.

They press a button, sending a lethal amount of electricity to the man, but yet again fails to kill him.

“How can this be happening!” They all exclaim.

And because the laws in this region are broken, the man is again free to go.

*


A few months later, the man has escaped to a far part of the world. Managing to hide his identity and get a job as a train conductor.

He’s driving along one day, just as normal, he’s extremely old now and can barely see.  

All of a sudden, someone jumps in front of the train.

Despite it being an accident, because of his track record the man is again sent to death row.

The time has come, it’s a year later, decades before the first time and the man is in the exact same cell as before.

“I don’t know how this keeps happening. But here is your banana.” The guard says.

“Thank you.” Says the man.

It’s now the moment of truth, if this does not work a third time the man has beaten the system and once again sent free.

He’s sitting in the electric chair, the priest cannot bring himself to say a prayer to this monster. Every guard in the prison is surrounding the man as he is strapped into the chair in every way possible.

The head guard walks over to the control panel, sweat dripping down his face. Everyone is looking at him, anxiously awaiting the moment the life leaves the mans eyes.

He presses a button.

Nothing.....


......


“HOW ARE YOU STILL ALIVE?” Says the guard in a rage of confusion. 

The man sits still, and looks the guard straight in his eyes, and finally opens his mouth after a long moment and says: 

“I’m just not a very good conductor.”",False

80,I knew a guy that dated a fifth dimensional energy being once.,"One night, he said, ""Hey, you trust me and I trust you, let's take this to the next level.""  

She said, ""No... trust is a four-way street.""  I wish I could say that he understood and it was alright, but instead his nose started bleeding and he fell into a deep coma.  

A few days later he awoke in the hospital, she was there, but he could tell something was wrong.  Things just went downtime from there.  A month earlier, she said she wanted a clean break.  So, a year and half ago, they never met.

83,The Apple Of Eden,"""Yo dawg check out this sweet crispy apple,"" Adam said as he was chilling and twiddling with his fig leaf. He started to ponder why exactly he had this leaf in place of a penis and how exactly he knew what penises were. God gave Adam a glare that just read ""Don't you try it kid or I'll add you to my torture porn collection."" and it made him shit himself.   
Adam was starting to grow tired of naming all the wildlife gibberish names to appease god. All of his time was either spent doing this or shitting all over the place. It was genuinely growing into a problem as he constantly had to be wary of stepping in his own fecal matter. He had started using the wildlife as towels even. All of god's creations were slowly one by one getting crusted with dried human shit as Adam wiped his feet off on them. Luckily god hadn't programmed them to be anything but docile yet so Adam had been enjoying this freedom almost a little too much. 

All of a sudden Adam had an epiphany.  Could he reach far enough to fit his fig leaf into his mouth if he had one less rib bone? He wondered how it would taste like. Perhaps he could spin this to god somehow and get his rib out so he could try this experiment? 

""Hey man, so you know how you made me in your image and all? If I'm like part godly and all I probably don't need all of my rib bones so you can take one and do whatever you want man. My treat!"" Adam said to God above. He scratched his neck a little in anticipation for the answer

God pondered for a moment and stroked his bushy ginger beard. This was before the grey hairs set in.  ""Perhaps I can forge you a sister for you to copulate with."" he said before sketching out his plan. After many rough drafts that night he settled on throwing testicles on her chest to tell them apart. 

God gave one snap of the finger and suddenly Adam had one less rib bone. Adam looked up to see God's new creation whilst in the midst of auto-fellatio and noticed that she had no nipples. It was disgusting. It turned him off entirely. Eve took her first step into Adam's shit.",False
84,A little long but worth reading....,"A handsome man went into a hotel and asked to see the boss. When the boss came, the story began.

-The client: is room 39 empty?
-The boss: yes, sir.
-The client: can I book it?
-The boss: of course you can.
-The client: thank you.

Before going to the room, the client asked the boss to provide him with a black knife, a white thread 39 cm and an orange 73g.

The boss agreed though he was surprized at the weird things the client asked to have.

The client went into his room, he didn't ask for food or anything else.

Unfortunately for the boss, his room was next to room 39.

After midnight, the boss heard strange voices and noise in that client's room. Voices of wild animals and of utensils and dishes being thrown on the floor.

The boss didn't sleep that night. He kept thinking and wondering what might be the source of the noise.

In the morning, when the client handed the keys to the boss, the latter asked to see the room first.

He went to the room and found everything alright. Nothing unusual. He even found the thread, the black knife and the orange on the table.

The client paid the bill and gave the bellboys a very good tip and left the hotel smiling.

The boss was in a shock but he didn't reveal what he heard to the bellboys. In fact, he started to doubt himself.

After one year, the client showed up again. He asked to see the boss again. The boss was in a puzzle.

The client asked the same things: room 39, black knife, white thread 39cm and an orange 79g.

This time, the boss wanted to know the truth by all means possible. He spent a sleepless night, waiting for something to happen. After midnight, the same voices and noises started, this time louder and more indecipherable than the year before.

Again, before leaving, the client paid his bill and left a large tip on the table for the bellboys. The smile didn't leave his face.

The boss started searching for the meaning of everything the client asked to have. Why did he ask room 39? why the white thread? why the black knife??? In fact, the boss didn't arrive to any convincing answer to all these questions.

The boss now was eagerly waiting for the month of March, the month in which the client showed up. 

To his surprise, on the first day of March, the same client showed up. He asked the same questions. Wanted to book the same room, wanted to have the same things as before.

The boss again heard the same noises, this time more louder than before.

In the morning, when the client was leaving the hotel, the boss apologized politely to the client and asked to know the secret behind the noises in the room.

-''If I tell you the secret, do you promise to never reveal it to anyone else?''
-''I promise I will never let anyone know''.
-''Swear''
-''I swear I won't reveal your secret''
So finally, the client revealed his secret to the boss. 

Unfortunately, the boss was a sincere person. Up until now he hasn't revealed his secret to anyone.

When he does, I will let you know...",False

88,The beer I'm currently drinking has its own personality. I like it.,"Its the same beer I drank when I was 18, at a field party; this time was also the seventh time I had drank alcohol, and back then I had no interest in the taste or emotions that come with beer drinking.

Anyone who knows me now, knows a 44 year old craft beer guzzling, chicken wing loving, rough and tough tumbler who can dive into the spiciest hot wings on the menu, and not flinch but die inside sweating in my tight fitting suit jacket to impress the female business woman sitting at the end of the bar of the Applebees bar I'm sitting at. That's me now, and the beer I'm drinking came across as familiar when I remembered that field party, and the stumbling around in the woods as my legs felt wobbly, I couldn't control myself.

That night, my friends dad gave us his blessing, and packed us a 24 pack of craft beers. The asshole included IPAs and Imperial Stouts, which all tasted like shit to me at the time, so I had drank straight rum instead, and became a very wobbly, innocent and harmless chubby boy walking around with an erection showing through my basketball shorts. Exactly as Tucker Max predicted, eventually my tactic worked, and a decent ""5"" walked over to me and looked up at me with red eyes. 

She had obviously been crying and that made me uncomfortable. She said she had told her boyfriend she felt sorry for me standing all by myself chugging rum in the ""background of the best years of his own life"". The boyfriend, being the jealous type, decided this meant she wanted to cheat on him and a fight had started. She tried to explain she only wanted to make me feel welcome to the party, instead of waiting all night to be invited to walk up the driveway.

And then I fell into the brush with the girl. It's not how it sounds...she had practically dragged me out there in the thick brush of the forest when she said she wanted me to try a beer, but didn't want to make the ""guy she was at the party with"" jealous. This guy did look much stronger than me, and I sure didn't want to get beaten up again, as several people had done to me at the previous 6 parties I had attended. I thought I had prepared appropriately, and was ready to be a party animal but I apparently I was wrong.

I guess I didn't really train appropriately, since my party animal training consisted only of drinking my parents vodka, alone, while masturbating to printed pictures of Yoko Ono. This reinforced behaviour, through the influx of dopamine flowing through my veins for hours at a time, caused me to become more advanced, being able to drunkenly bob my head to house music. During this time, while I fapped to the wife of the late Beatle, I tried not to think about John, who from what I recall, had died in a car accident, while being attacked by a high Ringo Starr, after Canada Day celebrations had gotten out of hand in New York City.

Anyways, there I sat, now resting on the hammock, with the girl. While whispering a standard consentual sex agreement to me, I could only listen to understand her tone was positive, since her breath smelled so strongly of cigarettes, I mostly focused on not gagging at the holes in her teeth. 

Finally, she nodded her head and pulled out her tit, and told me if I sucked, she would pump out the best beer. Me being a budding atheist, it was necessary to accept her offer, as the experience could provide useful insights into the Monk culture, who are known for their beer drinking rituals.

Upon me initiating my obligation to extract beer from her boob, I noticed that only a warm white liquid was coming out, to which a man behind me approached, hat in hand and said, ""The lines in the keg haven't been changed since Covid started, mista. You're drinking last February's yeast infection"".

I spit out the filth from my mouth. Put back on my foam cowboy hat, and galloped away with my friends dad's beer cooler.

It wasn't until I was back at the party, panting in the bed of a pickup truck close to the fire, in the middle of the keg stand station, when I realized - sometimes drinkig beer out of a tit isn't worth the milk that comes with it.",False

95,"It's been a tough day for Aleksandr Lermontov, son of Lavrentiy Lermontov of LermoCorp","Aleksandr Lermontov (nicknamed Lermontov Jr) has been under a great deal of stress lately. The Soviet government has been putting more and more pressure on him and LermoCorp to increase the firepower of Superman.

Lermontov Jr had been working feverishly day and night to fully harness the power of *Purple Kryptonite* and *Serbian Kryptonite* (a particularly special element which had been discovered in Serbia in the aftermath of a meteor strike in 2033).

Serbian Kryptonite enabled Superman to take over the minds of any human within 400 miles of him. However, Lermontov Jr had found during experiments that there was a major problem: if an individual was sufficiently mentally strong or had hidden mental superpowers, they could resist and actually end up taking over Superman's own mind. Lermontov Jr was especially worried that the Americans were aware of this and that they were recruiting a team of super-powered ""C-Men"", psychic-powered superbeings who could, collectively as a whole, take over Superman's mind and make him work for US interests - especially horrible given that Superman was raised in Vladivostok since he was a baby ever since his spaceship landed there.

Lermontov Jr was particularly stressed because he had so far omitted to inform the Soviet government of this major problem which, if it came to pass, could lead to the destruction of the Soviet Union as we know it.

Trebek had tinnitus. But it wasn't just your gramma's tinnitus, his had voices that would tell him the right questions to every answer. But today, they were telling him something very different.

""Ohh Lordy-doo... never thought I'd be so erotically seduced by a man older than me..."" thought Trebek. ""Alex, Alex, keep it in your pants, we have a show to run."" And so he announced the Categories for Double Jeopardy. 

""and lastly, Anti-Anti-Jokes"" said Trebek, to which his Tinnitus retorted.

Tinnitus: What is this whole subreddit about? 

""I'll take Anti-Anti-Joke for 400, Alex. "" said Chekhov with a winky face. 

""Oh, don't you wink at me... "" said Trebek. And the tinnitus retorted again. 

Tinnitus: What would the reader say about me dropping meta hints like acknowledging it's all meta? 

""Just look at his hunk of a figure, ohh and his guns are so oily and wet... I bet that he's hiding a massive bush down there, like astroturf."" Trebek thought while daydreaming about Chekhov. 

""A sentient dreidel walked into a bar. "" said Trebek, to which his Tinnitus retorted productively. 

Tinnitus: What is a setup? 

""What is a punchline?"" said Chekhov, flexing with his ginormous guns. They're just oiled up to perfection, you know? 

""Just this once, I'll give you a do-over."" said Trebek. The tinnitus then retorted. 

Tinnitus: What should I say to the readers who still don't understand that I'm making a question to a previous statement said by somebody, showing the meta-narrative of this anti-anti-joke? Is this even an anti-anti-joke? Does this even count as a joke? Am I going crazy? 

Trebek was now annoyed by his Tinnitus having an existential crisis. But he needed it, because he needed the questions. He lathered oil on himself to destress. 

""What is a punchline?"" said Chekhov, again, not knowing what a setup is. In fact all he knows is how to punch, with those oiled up GUNS. Punch Punch Punch.

Trebek was now annoyed by both his Tinnitus and Chekhov. But Chekhov is still hot AF, and beneath his bush lays his hypothetical scrotum. We know he has a scrotum, but does he have the balls? Are they as big as a grape? A grapefruit? A cartwheel? A cart? Or are they none of the above? 

""I'll have Anti-Anti-Joke for 800."" said Chekhov, like a male dominatrix. 

""You can't do that."" said Trebek. 

Tinnitus: What do we say to authors who just introduce a plot element out of the blue without setting it up first?

Chekhov then took out the Bible, and with Jesus Christ, commanded unto Trebek: ""Of course I could, it's an anti-anti-joke dumdum."" Then flew away riding with Jesus on a double-entendre. 

The tinnitus retorted: Wait, could Chekhov have known that we were all in an anti-anti-joke? 

""Wait a minute, look at the first two words of this whole essay! We were a Jeopardy Question all along! Truly Meta!"" said Trebek. 

""But since this is an anti-anti-joke, there must be a reference to the other anti-anti-jokes!"" said the Narrator.

The prosecutor indeed stooped that low. His saggy balls, saggy balls of a gentleman, the saggy balls smothered the floor. Ungentlemanlike. 

""He's flexing, judge! Don't let him flex like that!"" shouted the Defense Attorney. 

""Objection!"" said the plaintiff. ""Gentlemen can do whatever they want!"" 

The mosquito clapped back. ""But a mosquito can't climb a wall? I'll fucking suck the blood out of your bald dome you eggman.""

This was indeed real love in first sight, the prosecutor also saw the sexual prowess of the mosquito. We got a love triangle here folks! 

""umm excuse me? Prosecutor? Isn't that a slur to bald people?"" asked the ugly plaintiff. 

""Haha suck a dick you miserable cueball. Oh wait, you don't even have teeth!"" giggled the Prosecutor. 

""But the mosquito also doesn't have teeth. "" Said the Defense Attorney who was now acting like a Devil's Advocate. 

""Are you acting like the Devil's Advocate? Trick question, you can't because you ARE the Devil."" said the mosquito while getting its proboscis licked by the judge. 

""Am I the Devil?"" this was a question that haunted the Devil throughout the whole proceeding. 

""Why don't you defend me devil, I'll shave my bush for you"" parlayed the plaintiff, losing both his prosecutor and his teeth. 

""Ok. "" acquiesced the Devil. 

""Hey guys, don't leave me out of the fun!"" asked the prosecutor readying for the threesome. 

""Quick, Call me Judge Judy, cause it helps me cum more than once"" exclaimed the mosquito while reaching the rare power climax. 

""I—I just cant. The prosecutor just weirds me out. I do want to call you judge judy, in fact I can say judge judy 10 times, but the prosecutor looks like the walrus."" puked the judge. 

""Oh you choosy bitch. You choosy bitch of a clit. Your imaginary clit smothered the floor. Look what you've done."" gentlemaned the prosecutor. 

""Why don't we get the bailiff and start a threesome of our own?"" argued the bald sentient sexdoll. 

""Semolina"" Pilchared the Devil. 

""As long as I get to know how many vaginas the Devil has."" inquired the Bailiff. 

""Six, it's in Dante's Inferno. Dipshit."" said the Devil. Edgar Allan Poe.

""Two women broke in here and killed themselves, the sink, toilet and shower head are covered in blood, all of the light bulbs have been displaced, and the first thing you take notice of when you walk in… is the smell of fucking updog?""

""Sure do,"" Mr. Thomson said without the slightest tinge of irony. ""It's quite foul, eh? Updog, that is. The smell of it. Of updog.""

He sighed in disbelief at the foolish man that stood before him. Seven years he'd served in the investigative branch, hoping beyond hope that one day, some case would emerge among the countless obvious homicides that would pique his interest and be his and his only to solve. And for once, there it was, right in front of him—a true mystery at last. He'd even phoned up the owner of the place, to show how seriously he was going to take it. But alas, this clown served no use for him, and soon those thoughts of doubt came creeping again. The court would soon rule this a simple case of joint suicide before he would be assigned to yet another mundane murder.

No, he thought. Not this time. He wasn't going to let anything impede his progress. He was going to put his all into this, no matter what. No more delays.

""Okay, sir, thank you for your cooperation. We'll take it from here. Please stay at your hotel until the investigation is over.""

""No problemo.""

&nbsp;

Mr. Thomson walked down the corridor, his yellow striped tie swinging with every step he took. It was clear to all the cops in the hallway that he had never suited up like this in his life, and to some degree they felt rather sorry for him. He smiled back at their lowered faces, holding his best impression of a clueless man as he passed by.

The hotel they let him stay at was miles away, and though he certainly wasn't thrilled by the look of his house, he would much sooner run out the doors and back there than willingly be in the presence of those freaks again. But he'd been left with no choice; the walls were closing in on him, and he felt as though he would crack any moment. ""I want out,"" he whispered to the receptionist. ""Please.""

She smiled at him blankly and handed him the key. Mr. Thomson sighed and went to the elevator, making sure to face away from the door, as he had been instructed.

Sure enough, just one floor above him, that hooded man walked in. He couldn't see him, but he could tell from the distinct squeak of his glossy shoes who it was. ""You have done well, Roger."" He felt a stack of banknotes slide into his pocket.

""Please, I… I don't want the money. I don't want nothing in this. Just please let him go.""

""You will see your brother once you've outlived your importance."" He felt the hot breath come closer to his neck. ""And you are of great importance to us now.""

He knew he was in no place to bargain, so he kept his mouth shut. The elevator stopped again, and the hooded man got ready to leave.

""Wait,"" Mr. Thomson said, ""just for the record—what the hell is 'updog'?""

A short silence followed, then a deep snigger. ""Wouldn't you like to know?"" The doors closed, and Mr. Thomson was once again left alone with his thoughts, that all hovered over his infinite abyss of despair.",False

157,Why did the man post on r/antiantijokes?,"Because he felt that by posting there, he expressed part of the complexity of his self, which was only pleasantly compounded by the settling on his personal core of the subreddit itself. His identity could be explored and exposed to the outside world by posting, commenting, and perhaps even upvoting the content of this subreddit. As  it further deepened the connection between him and the rest of creation, the man enjoyed letting multiple elements of his personality, his environment and his upbringing shine through in his interactions on r/antiantijokes, and letting these expositions interact with themselves and with himself.  


I expect at least some of you readers to be interested in the three pillars of identity which were just mentioned, but I'll have to constrain myself to regaling you with just a sliver of  the last of those elements: upbringing. Some years ago, a man who went by Dick worked in water sanition. According to Dick, water sanitation is a rather dry job. To combat the boredom he clearly developed a weapon not entirely unlike the evil he wished to destroy: dry humor. I'll have to skip even more of this history for the sake of brevity, but it's enough to say that Dick's dry humor was so instrumental to his mental survival on the job, that it slowly carved a prominent spot for itself near the core of Dick's being. Eventually, he got married to a smart and charming but sickly woman. This happened quite unrelatedly to his job. In fact, Dick was thinking of quitting. But I digress. Him and his wife adopted three adorable daughters by the names of April, May and June. April grew up to be a writer of unconventional literary non-fiction, May developed herself as a late night comedian, and June tragically passed away at a young age while giving birth to our protagonist.  


April and May raised their nephew, as his father had passed even before his mother had – another detail I will have to skim over. The two women, along with their by now widowed father, formed a tightly knit triangle of love that was  instrumental in turning the orphaned babe into the man he would become. r/antiantijokes attracted this man partly because he was immediately curious to try and see if he could conjure up a pun based on his two aunts. Or, more likely, two fictional aunts. It was a rather meta-hungry sub, after all.

**I get what you're trying to say.**

*Yeah, those things were killing people left and right. I don't know why.*

**Probably because of the wave of hollow vim spilling from the geyser in the center of the park. The toasters were built to toast things, so once they were filled with vim from the fountain, they toasted everything and everyone they could.**

*Why'd that happen?*

**To this day, nobody knows. Not even the best astrologists and thaumatists can figure out why the geyser decided to spill all that vim, nor why it was hollow.**

So I yank the ghostly looking dude away from Senator Goodmanssonn and confront him.

""You! Why'd you keep calling the Senator that?! Only *you* call him that - even in public!"" I snap.

""I...I...but he's the Senate President. I'm just showing respect,"" the kid replies.

The East European terrorist smirks and replies: ""To fack your mader, that heppened to be working her usual side of the road thet night.""

Jerry further loses his temper and lands a few punches at the terrorist's face. The terrorist stares blankly at Jerry and says: ""Did a little kitten just kiss me? The fack was thet?""

Jerry tries again: ""I'm asking the questions here! Why did the rooster cross the road!?""

The terrorist answers: ""To gather his rooster comrades so they could take your mader to motel and hef intercourse. It was a 3 for 2 Saturday special discount, how could they decline such an affer?""

Jerry punches the terrorist in the cheek repeatedly, to which the terrorist then remarks:""You hit like little taddler with cerebral parese, put more weight into your right foot and maybe you hit more like 8th grader next time.""

""Shut up! Why did the rooster cross the road!?"" Jerry asks again, this time forming a tear in his eye. Jerry punches the terrorist a couple more times afterwards until he has seemingly had enough.

The terrorist says, now raising his voice: ""Oof! Okay, okay. Stap! I'll cooperate...to arrive at the drop-off point and retrieve the peckege.""

Jerry widens his eyes in anticipation now that he has finally managed to break down the terrorist. He eagerly turns around and yells towards a locked door behind him: ""This guy is about to talk! Get in here, sir!""

He redirects his attention at the terrorist as another man that's wearing a suit unlocks the door and walks into the interrogation room. Jerry continues: ""Yeah? Well, go on! What was inside the package?! Where was the drop-off point?! Where is the package now?!""

The terrorist asks: ""Can I hef pen and paper? I will draw mep of location of peckege. I don't know whet is inside. I just follow directions, no questions asked. The rooster knows.""

The suited man, who acts as Jerry's handler gives a subtle nod to Jerry. Jerry produces a pen and a notebook from the breast pocket of his shirt. They uncuff the terrorist and allow him to draw a map.

Jerry shows the map to his handler to which the handler says:""Excellent! Good job, kid! Go outside and wait for the chopper. I'm calling it in now. A tactical team will be joining you."" Jerry rushes outside the CIA's headquarters in Langley. He is eventually picked up by a helicopter that is occupied by a heavily armed tactical unit.

They fly for almost two hours and land near their destination. The tactical team disembark the helicopter alongside Jerry and they close in on a motel that was marked on the hand drawn map. The map also depicts the room number of their target. Upon arriving they discreetly evacuate the motel's lobby, quickly retrieve information about the targeted room and its occupants and stack up at the room's door.

This is it. The case Jerry has been working on for months is starting to near a conclusion, or so Jerry thinks as the team breach the door and throw a stinger grenade into the room. As they enter, their field of vision is obscured by feathers slowly descending to the floor. They see several dead roosters, severed beaks, limbs, blood splatter and Jerry Seinfeld's disheveled mother lying on the bed. She is covered in a blanket and has a confused expression on her face.

All the roosters have died from the stinger grenade's detonation, except one of them. The surviving rooster emerges from underneath Jerry's mother's blanket and stares angrily at Jerry. It abruptly tries to exit the room by running in-between the men's feet in order to reach the doorway but is pushed back by the light thrust of a team member's foot. The rooster then exclaims:

""I got tons of cash. My aunt gave me $19,000 last week - we can gamble it all in Henderson,"" Ewan sighed deeply and dangled his truck keys in front of Todd's face.

Hours later, the pair were nearing the Louisiana-Texas border. Todd was asleep and Ewan was driving now. The Buick's engine hummed loudly after the latest gas station stop.

Ewan cursed and pulled over. He took out a cigarette and lit it up. He then walked away from the SUV and further into nearby fields.
As he inhaled, he started to think of what he was going to do about Todd. 

As he stood there, looking up at the sunset - Todd snoring heavily back in the car and a cool breeze blowing softly - flashes of light in the sky to the northeast caught his eye.

*Was it meteorites?* Ewan thought. 

As the objects got closer, hurtling towards Earth, Ewan began to run towards what he predicted to be the possible crash site.

*Jesus, I could make the goddamn news!* Ewan thought excitedly.

""Hey, Todd!"" He screamed back loudly as he ran. ""Wake up - you should see this!"" 

In all the excitement - as he raced towards the predicted impact spot of some of the objects - Ewan didn't see the hidden remnants of an old tree stump.

Smack! Ewan's skull smashed into the pieces of rock lying next to the old tree stump. Blood gushed out of the gaping wound in his head. He had already immediately lost consciousness upon impact and with the rapid blood loss, Ewan King III, unemployed, of Mobile, Alabama - whose daddy used to be a cop but was now ""an oilman and dabbler of sorts"" and whose aunty, now a widow, was an old miserly millionairess, having survived her husband, a shipping tycoon born and raised in Atlanta Georgia - had only minutes to live, probably two at best.

Seven and a half minutes later, the meteorites made impact 400 yards from the body of Ewan King III.

Upon first sight, any observer would have remarked that a giant spider had crashed into Earth, but it would have quickly become apparent that the ""giant spider"" was in fact a spaceship of some kind.

A loud hiss and doors opened as bright, blue light spilled out.

From the spacecraft emerged a powerfully built male, naked, with bright blue hair and bright blue eyes, standing over 7 feet tall. Emblazoned across his chest was what appeared to be a giant ""V"".

As the barkeep pours his drink, she takes notice of him looking puzzled at the interior. Everything was rather ornate, too ornate for the small town of Riverport where the man lived. Portraits covered the walls depicting a vast variety of people of many time periods. The other patrons seemed equally as varied.

""First time at Allport?"" the barkeep inquired with a slight grin as she handed him his glass.

""Yup, strange place. You just opened up right?""

""In your town, yes. We're known all over the world though. I'll give you the rundown of this place"" she lowered her voice to a whisper with her grin getting even wider. ""This is gonna sound pretty weir—""

Just then the entire room shook as a tentacle burst through the front door sending splinters at alarming speeds across the room. In a flash the barkeep pulled a lever behind the bar lowering a portcullis stabbing through the tentacle, severing the limb. Several bright flashes followed by a hum of typewriters came from the opposite side of the room as all of this was happening.

""Well, I was about to explain everything before something like this happened—tends to be a little easier on newcomers. We are no longer in Riverport.

""Other times it simply teleports to the next port. It's not really up to us, the Allport kinda has a mind of its own.

Therefore, the hen moved onwards; towards her destiny. 

For she did not know it at the time, but past the road was a small town full of good, simple people. 

It wasn't more than a stopover, really. 

There was a single gas station-slash-convenience store that was run by a kind but homely man named Virgil. 

There were several farms that were still owned by honest hardworking people instead of corporations that played hard and fast with genetics, robots, and production. 

And there was even a small library there that was presided over by a librarian with the auspicious name of Miss Missy; the prettiest librarian in the whole county. 

One fine morning, these people woke up and started their daily routines.

225,"So, there was this Englishman, and an Irishman, and a Scotsman.","And they were all fighting in some war. And they got captured by the enemy. And the enemy accused them all of being spies, and said they were going to execute them by firing squad. So, the Englishman went up first. They stood him before a wall, they offered him a chance to speak to the padre, a final cigarette. When he was done, the soldiers all raised their rifles, and pointed them at him, and the captain began to give the orders for them to shoot. ‘Look out! Earthquake!’ shouted the Englishman, and the soldiers all turned around in alarm, and in the confusion the Englishman ran away.
 That’s a good idea, thought the Scotsman. He was taken to the wall. He was offered a padre, a cigarette. Now it was his turn to get shot. The firing squad aimed their guns. ‘Tornado!’ shouted out the Scotsman. The soldiers all whirled around, they didn’t want a tornado creeping up behind them, and the Scotsman managed to get away.
 This is easy, said the Irishman to himself. And if those two eejits can escape, then sure and begorrah I can too. He was calm as they led him to the wall. He had a casual chat with the padre, really savoured that final cigarette. He allowed himself a smile of anticipated triumph as the firing squad raised their guns. ‘Ready, aim—’ began the captain. The Irishman shouted, ‘Fire!’


 
 When they were off duty, the Englishman, the Irishman and the Scotsman didn’t have much to say to each other.

 It wasn’t a big room, but over time they’d learned ways of keeping themselves to themselves. The Scotsman liked to sit at the table and play cards. He made no sound at all, save the soft flip-flip-flip as he turned them over and sorted them by suit. The Irishman lay on his bunk. There he might doze, or smoke, or drink, however the fancy took him. The Englishman often just sat on the floor and stared off into the middle distance. He called it meditation. The Scotsman and the Irishman both thought he looked ridiculous, but they never let on. They didn’t want to provoke an argument. They had enough of that in the act.

 Sometimes entire days would pass and they wouldn’t say a word. But it was perfectly genial, and they might exchange glances every now and then, and smile.

 The Englishman once told them he’d been with another troupe beforehand, and they’d wanted to spend all their free time rehearsing. Over and over again, this other Scotsman and this other Irishman, practising their patter, honing their routine. ‘I couldn’t stand it,’ said the Englishman. ‘Comedy’s got to have a certain spontaneity to it, right?’ His Scotsman and his Irishman agreed. Neither could remember a time when they’d performed with another Englishman, as far as they were concerned it had been the three of them in this tiny room forever. It annoyed them to think the Englishman had a bit of history they didn’t. But though they were fond of the Englishman, they knew the English were famous liars. He was probably just making it up.

 In the evening they took turns to cook. Roast beef and Yorkshire pudding. Haggis with tatties. Irish stew. They didn’t necessarily cook what you might expect them to cook; the Scotsman, for example, had a way with Irish stew, and the Englishman’s tatties were second to none. Their kitchen skills were quite varied, and in their private lives they sought to avoid cultural stereotyping as much as possible.
 

 The Irishman didn’t much mind being the butt of all the jokes. What he resented was the unending predictability of them. The Englishman and the Scotsman might sometimes vary the routine; if they were doing the firing squad sketch, they might instead choose to shout out ‘Avalanche!’ or ‘Tsunami!’ Just to see how it sounded, they said, just to keep things fresh. The Irishman had no such freedom. You can fuck about with the setup, but a punchline is sacrosanct. Sometimes he would envy the Englishman and the Scotsman and their freewheeling improvisational ways, whilst he so laboriously had to stick to the script. Sometimes he would rather hate them.
 That said, he was always the one who got the laughs.
 

 They were never given much notice. There’d be a knock at the door, just the one. It could be day or night. The Englishman, the Irishman and the Scotsman would stop whatever they were doing. The closest to the door would open it, and outside there’d be a box with their costumes in. The Englishman had a bowler hat, the Scotsman a tartan kilt, the Irishman was always dressed in muddy overalls and looked like a tramp. 
 They wouldn’t know which joke they were doing until they got out there. If they were in a desert, it’d be the car door sketch. If it were a construction site, the ham sandwich. Any sort of battlefield, really, if there were soldiers running about and shooting at each other and blowing themselves up, it’d probably turn into the firing squad sketch sooner or later. The firing squad always seemed very popular.

 Once in a while they’d get a jungle, and then it would be the canoe sketch. They all enjoyed the canoe sketch, the weather was so nice and warm.

 There was this Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman. And they were in the jungle. And they got caught by this jungle tribe. Real darkie savages, with bones through their noses, and the chief told them they were all going to die. But this wouldn’t be some pointless execution by firing squad, their deaths would be of valuable service to the tribe.

 The chief examined the Englishman, felt his skin. He said it was good skin, very tight, very strong. It would make heap good canoe. And he told the Englishman that the next morning he would be killed, and that his skin would be flayed from his dead body and turned into a canoe, but on his last night alive he could have whatever he desired. So the Englishman asked for a bottle of whisky, and a squaw he could have sex with. He was given the bottle, and a beautiful squaw led him to a teepee, and all night he drank and made wild love. And at sunrise he was taken out, his throat was slit, his skin cut off, and he was turned into a canoe.

 Pretty soon, though, the canoe went over a waterfall and was lost. So the chief went to the Scotsman and inspected him. He felt his skin, and said that it was very firm, very hairy, and just right to make heap good canoe. The Scotsman was allowed to have whatever he wanted. He chose five bottles of whisky, and hand-picked the five most beautiful squaws in the tribe. He went to the teepee. By sunrise he was already dead, but there was a big smile on his face. And his skin was cut off, and he was turned into a canoe.

 Pretty soon the canoe was lost, it went over a waterfall. So the chief went to the Irishman. He liked his skin. He said he could do great things with that skin. Coarse like hemp, when the Irishman’s skin was sliced from his body, when every little fleck of it was cut off the bone, and dried, and left to bake in the heat, it would make the heap finest canoe they had ever seen. The Irishman would be killed in the morning. But before he died, for his last night alive, he could have whatever he desired. The tribal barmen got the bottles of whisky ready, and all the squaws lined up in preparation. The Irishman asked for a fork. Nothing else – just a fork. The chief was puzzled, but agreed to grant his wish. They brought him a fork, and it was the best fork the tribe had, it was a golden fork and its tines gleamed in the sun. The Irishman took the fork. He held the fork up high, just for a moment, as if in reverence. And then, suddenly, he brought it down hard, and sank it into his leg. And faster, in a frenzy, stabbing hard all over his body, his arms, his bare chest, his face. And crying out, ‘Try to get me afloat now, you bastards!’

 Actually, the Irishman didn’t enjoy the canoe sketch as much as his friends did.
 

 Was it Heaven or Hell? They didn’t know. It was just where the dead would finish up. As something the living could laugh at.

 On Sundays – they liked to call it Sundays – the Englishman, the Irishman and the Scotsman were let out of their room, and could explore the courtyard, and meet the rest of the comedians. All the other Englishmen, Irishmen and Scotsmen – and Belgians too, and Polacks, and Canadians, and blacks, and cripples, and Jews. All the fat mother-in-laws, the doctors and patients, men walking into bars, and chickens in endless droves crossing roadways and never quite being sure what their intentions were in doing so. It was good to get out, there was always something to tickle the funny bone.
 

 It had been an especially good gig. Or an especially bad one – either way, there was a present waiting for them on their doorstep the next morning. They couldn’t tell how old she was, they had no experience of little girls. She seemed frightened, she didn’t want to come in, and all three men had to back off until she dared put a foot over the threshold. She blinked at them, ready to run. Around her neck was a sign that said, ‘Your Daughter’.

 But whose daughter? There was no clue. She was beautiful. She hadn’t the sallow eyes of the Englishman, the red beard of the Scotsman, the Irishman’s skin as craggy as a cliff face. Oh, those eyes. Oh, that hair. ‘Maybe if she spoke to us,’ said the Englishman; ‘We’ll tell from the accent,’ said the Scotsman; ‘What’s your name, little darlin’?’ said the Irishman. And the girl opened her mouth, and she couldn’t answer them, her tongue had been ripped from her head.

 They didn’t know how to be fathers. They tried their very best. The Englishman taught the girl how to be prim and repressed. The Scotsman taught her how to be mean and angry. The Irishman taught her to be stupid. And they’d be on their best behaviour around her, they wouldn’t swear or fart or scratch at their balls. They’d play games with her, they’d make toys for her out of their few possessions. And in the evening, if she were a good girl, and she was always a good girl, they’d perform for her. They’d do their jokes, but with an eagerness that they’d never showed to the general public, their comedy was pure and true and so touching it even made them cry in spite of themselves. The girl wouldn’t cry. She’d giggle and clap her hands and each night when the jokes were over she’d give each of her three daddies a great big hug.
 

 Comedy is, of course, subjective. What makes one person laughs leaves another stone cold. And the Englishman, the Irishman and the Scotsman all had different tastes. What the Englishman really liked was dry wit, and he had a particular liking for the aphorisms of Wilde and Shaw, and he would have happily entertained his colleagues with examples had they wanted him to do so. They didn’t. The Scotsman loved puns. He thought there was something inherently clever about a pun – the way that things had double meanings and were more complex than they first looked, because wasn’t that what life was like, really, wasn’t that just like life? From what he could remember – and sometimes in the night if it were dark or it were cold, he would reassure himself by counting in his head all the puns he had ever known, and there were fourteen. The Irishman liked pratfalls. So he liked to take the top bunk, and if he woke in the morning suddenly and forgot where he was, he might roll out of bed and tumble all the way to the ground. It gave him something of a thrill.

 They would have friendly arguments about the nature of comedy. The Englishman sided with the theories of Freud, and talked about the power of words set into a specific repeated system in order to elicit a response. The Scotsman sided with Kant, and said that comedy was all about dissonance, about the reversal of expectation even to the point of absurdism. The Irishman thought it was all about pointing at people and laughing when they got hurt.

 None of them thought the jokes they took part in were especially good. There was no class to them, no wordplay, not enough custard pie fights or falling down stairs. But they were still proud of the services they offered, they’d seen other Englishmen, Irishmen and Scotsmen out there, and they were up there with the best. 

 And their daughter liked what they did. Even when she was no longer an infant. Even when she became a teenager, and she was as tall as they were, and had grown breasts and curves. Even when she became a young woman, and was the most beautiful young woman any of them had ever seen. She still giggled, and clapped her hands, and hugged them – and she was there each time they came home from work, and it made everything worthwhile.
 

 There was this Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman, and they shared a daughter that they loved with all their hearts. But they knew they couldn’t keep her forever, that one day she would leave. She’d have to go out into the world, and find a joke of her very own. She’d have to get married, and fast – women weren’t allowed to be in jokes unless they had a husband to nag. The Englishman, Irishman and the Scotsman all took turns to make their recommendations. The Englishman went first. He had a list of suitable English candidates as long as his arm. But when the time came, he couldn’t do it – he knew exactly what Englishmen were like, and he went pale at the thought that his beloved daughter would be saddled with a single one of them. Next was the Scotsman. The Scotsman opened his mouth to speak – but out came a sob, he couldn’t bear to lose his girl, no one Scottish was good enough to deserve her! Finally came the Irishman. The girl liked the Irishman, he always made her laugh the most of all, and she smiled because she knew he wouldn’t let her down. The Irishman said he had considered all the men in the world – not just the English, Scots and the Irish, but the Welsh too, and the Spanish, and the Greeks – he’d been around the courtyard looking for prospective suitors, and there wasn’t a man amongst them who was worthy. So he did the only thing he could, and married her to one of the chickens.
 After their daughter had left, they couldn’t stop thinking of her. It threw them quite off their stride. And the next time there was that one knock at the door, and they were summoned to do their act, they were in tatters. Their comic timing was off. The Englishman and the Scotsman went in the wrong order. The Irishman forgot what he was meant to say, and the firing squad was obliged to shoot him without a punchline. There was no laughter from the void. They went back home quiet, thoughtful, afraid. They’d all heard tales of what happened to jokes that stopped being funny.
 ‘We can’t talk about her,’ said the Englishman; ‘Never again,’ agreed the Scotsman; ‘For our own good,’ said the Irishman. They fell silent. The Scotsman sat at the table and played cards. The Irishman lay in bed and smoked. The Englishman squatted upon the ground and stared off into the middle distance, he didn’t stop staring for three whole days.
 

 The Englishman would sometimes try to hang himself. So they’d all push the bunk beds away from the wall, so they could reach the light fittings – the Irishman would usually go up, he was the best with knots, and he’d tie the rope and let down a noose large enough to hold the Englishman’s fat head. The Englishman would ask the Scotsman and the Irishman to pull down on his legs to make his death cleaner; he’d get on the chair, and he’d say goodbye to them, and he’d kick the chair away. And the Scotsman would grab one leg, and the Irishman the other, and they’d pull with all their might, but no matter how hard they tried the Englishman’s neck would never break. And at last the Englishman would give up trying to choke, and he’d sigh, and sulk, and just stay up there twisting slowly from side to side. If he were particularly disappointed, he might stay in the noose for hours. The Scotsman and the Irishman hated it when he did that, it looked just as stupid as when he was meditating.

 So it was no surprise that the Englishman was the first to break ranks. ‘I’ve got another job,’ he told them one day. It turned out he’d been going to auditions secretly behind their backs. He’d got the part of the knock knock man. ‘You know the knock knock jokes, they’re huge,’ said the Englishman – ‘Chances are next time you tell one of those, you’ll be talking about me!’ He wouldn’t need his bowler hat any longer, he wasn’t an Englishman, he was an Everyman, he was to be the personification of everyone who has ever tried to gain admission through a door, regardless of age, creed or gender.

 On his last night in the room they had a farewell party. They drank wine and ate cake and they reminisced about the good old days when they were a team. All the old anecdotes came out – all of them, except the ones featuring their daughter. The Englishman got quite tearful: ‘I don’t want to leave you dear chaps, I’ve changed my mind, I want to stay here with you!’ But no one thought he really meant it. ‘I’ll invite you to my first night,’ he promised them, ‘I’ll get you in for free!’ The knock knock gig was one of the hottest tickets in town. They thanked him, they told him not to bother.
 The Scotsman and the Irishman continued their act alone. It still basically worked. They realised the Englishman had been a dead weight, all he’d done was to delay the pay-off. They told themselves the show was just as good as it had always been, and a bit quicker to boot. But they both knew that without the Englishman something was lost in the rhythm. And some nights out would come the whisky and the Guinness. ‘I miss the stuck-up bastard,’ the Scotsman would say. ‘Sure, b’jasus, I miss him too,’ the Irishman would reply.

 They received a postcard from the Englishman one day. It said, ‘Wish you were here’. And on the reverse side, no picture at all, nothing, no, not a thing.
 

 One day the Scotsman admitted, ‘I’m not even really Scottish. I was born in Huddersfield.’

 He remembered it all, he said. Where he was brought up. Where he went to school. What his parents looked like, his mother, his beautiful mam. He remembered the party he was thrown for his seventh birthday. His first job, why he was sacked from his first job, his second job. Meeting Annabelle. Marrying Annabelle. Her face, her lips, her eyes, her tongue. Annabelle. The Irishman asked if he remembered his own name as well. The Scotsman said, ‘No. No. No.’ He kept trying, but still the name wouldn’t come. ‘No. No. No. I don’t know who I am. I don’t know who I am.’

 The Scotsman remembered how he’d died. He told the Irishman all about it.

 There was this Englishman, an Irishman, and a Scotsman. And they were captured by the enemy. And the enemy thought they were spies, and decided they would execute them. But they wouldn’t shoot them by firing squad, nor would they make canoes from their flayed skin. They would give them a chance. ‘Go into the forest,’ they said. ‘And each of you must return with ten pieces of fruit.’ And the men did so. ‘Now, if you can perform this task, we shall set you free. You must insert all of your fruit up your back passage in total silence. If you fail to insert every last piece of fruit, death. If you make a sound whilst doing so, death. If you hesitate, death. Begin.’ The Englishman had found ten apples. He was able to squeeze two Granny Smiths up between his cheeks, and though his eyes watered he held his tongue. But it was the Golden Delicious that did for him, no matter how hard he poked it in it just kept rolling back out again, and the effort made him wince with pain. ‘Your life is forfeit,’ they said, and they took him aside, and strangled him. Then it was the Scotsman’s turn. The Scotsman had picked ten blackberries. He bent over, spread his legs wide to give his anus the optimum width, and he began stuffing the blackberries up there one by one. He was doing so well. And then, on the eighth blackberry, the Scotsman could no longer help it, he burst out laughing. ‘Your life is forfeit,’ he was told, and, still giggling, he was taken aside and strangled. The Scotsman went up to Heaven. There the Englishman was waiting on a cloud. ‘What happened?’ asked the Englishman. ‘You seemed to be home and dry!’ ‘I know,’ said the Scotsman, ‘but I couldn’t stop thinking of that Irishman coming next with his pineapples.’

 ‘And that’s how you died? For real?’ The Irishman thought this was all very spurious, but the Scotsman was sick now, he’d had to pause three times telling the story in order to cough up blood, and the Irishman didn’t think it was right to criticise.

 ‘Do you think it’s possible to die twice?’ croaked the Scotsman. He looked suddenly so small and frightened, because really, who knows what happens to us when our time is up?

 The Scotsman died, and the Irishman wept, and held him a wake, and drank all night in his honour. And before he went to bed he put outside all the empty bottles of whisky and the empty bottles of Guinness and the Scotsman’s corpse, ready for collection in the morning.
 

 The Irishman was alone, and he felt alone too. If there was any part of his now forgotten life when he had ever experienced such loneliness, he was glad it was gone from his head, he didn’t want it back. He lay on his bunk, and dozed, and smoked and drank. But there was no fun in ignoring people when there was no one there to ignore.

 One day there was a knock at the door. The Irishman hadn’t thought he’d be wanted ever again. There was a costume waiting for him, his familiar dirty tramp outfit. He put it on, warily. No doubt he was to be teamed with another Englishman and another Scotsman, but they’d be strangers to him. He just hoped there’d be some natural chemistry between them. Comedy was no good without the chemistry.

 He went out on to the battlefield. He had been wrong. He had no new partners. He was now a solo act.

 There was this Irishman, and he was fighting in some war. Probably. And he got captured by the enemy. And the enemy thought he was a spy, and sentenced him to death by firing squad. And so that’s what they did – they shot him.

 There wasn’t much humour to be gleaned from that, the Irishman felt afterwards. The audience hadn’t even wanted him to say anything. There he’d been, all prepared to shout out the punchline, he’d got his cheesy grin all ready and had opened his mouth, but it was too late, the bullets tore him to pieces.

 He thought it’d be different the next time. 

It wasn’t.

 This was the new comedy. It didn’t want to waste time on setup, on delay, on delivery. It didn’t care about pace, charm or timing. Without the Englishman and the Scotsman to layer the gag, the joke could cut to the chase. The Irishman could come on, and they’d shoot him, or they’d flay his skin to make a canoe, or they’d stick pineapples up his arse.
 And the unseen crowds would laugh and stomp their feet and holler for more – and the Irishman couldn’t quite see what it was that so entertained them. He was just dying, where was the skill in that? He didn’t even have time to pull a funny face.
 Back in his room he’d rehearse. Try to adjust to the new act. He concentrated on the pratfalls he so loved, because he could at least be sure at some point there’d be a spot of falling over to be done. He devised amusing ways he could collapse in death. He tried his best. But the truth of it was, for all his hard work and preparation, in performance it never went the way he planned. The impact of the bullets burst his body open, and if it burst at an amusing angle it had really very little to do with him.

 Still, the Irishman was very popular. 

He got lots of bookings.


 There was this Irishman, and they shot him. 

There was a simplicity to that he supposed he should be proud of. As he stood before the firing squad, he knew he was dying for his country. It made him feel better somehow. It gave him an identity. Some days he went out to work with something of a swagger in his step.
 There was this Irishman, and he was captured, and put before the firing squad. They denied him the padre, they denied him the solace of a final cigarette. The soldiers all pointed their rifles at him, and the captain began to give the orders to shoot him, as he’d done so many countless times before.


 The Irishman looked out amongst his killers, and saw there a face he recognised.


 He stepped forward.


 ‘It’s all right,’ he said.


 Because she was so frightened. Maybe it was her first time. He didn’t know if she remembered him. He saw in her face all the primness the Englishman had taught her, all the meanness the Scotsman had made her practise hard. And he saw what he’d given her, that she was as thick as shit in the neck of a bottle.
 And, oh, she was beautiful, she’d been miscast, surely? She shouldn’t have been a killer. Those eyes, that hair. 
 Her rifle trembled as he approached. She tried to say something, her tongueless mouth opened and closed and opened again.
 ‘It’s all right,’ he said once more. ‘You’re doing fine, darlin’.’ He took hold of the rifle barrel, moved it so it pressed lightly against his throat. ‘I’m proud of you, and all the folks out there are proud of you. You’re going to be a star.’ He gave her a smile, and she managed a smile back, and he knew that it was all worth it, and there was not a laugh out there in the whole wide world that could spoil it.
 ‘Pull the trigger,’ he whispered. She did.",False

231,An agitated Lord Voldemort is sat in a private helicopter enroute to Portland in Oregon,"He's not happy; he's not satisfied.

For the last 850 years, he's had to endure life on Earth, but finally he may be snapping; he may have had enough.

Sure, the mansion in Portland is great. Sure, the fresh supply of 18 and 19 years old each week is great. Sure, the sex is great. Sure, the beach house in Malibu is awesome sometimes - and the penthouse in Seattle...and the chalet in Nice. Yeah, great, all great. But Lord Voldemort has grown agitated and restless.

So, one day, in 2027, he begins to sell off all of his assets. He then chops off his legs and arms and regrows new strong, long limbs. He then grows a dark black layer of skin, creates a new identity for himself using his sorcery and zips over to Senegal - a former state which had just recently endured a 5-year-long civil war and was now practically three ""countries"".

Standing at 7 foot and 3 inches, he uses his sorcery and masculine and domineering persona and strong voice to persuade millions to have him as their leader. He persuades them that under his lifelong dictatorship, they can have a good, long life with security and safety and distributed wealth.

By 2030, the Kingdom of Senegal has been recognised by the UN and all countries bar Australia and New Zealand.

By 2033, the Kingdom of Senegal has expanded into Mauritania and Mali.

By 2035, six more West African countries all hold referendums to voluntarily join the Kingdom.

By 2036, the Kingdom of Senegal has peacefully annexed most of West Africa and parts of North Africa.

All the while, Lord Voldemort has been using his sorcery to get away with this and has not had to deal with much resistance - except from the Australians and Kiwis, who strangely appear to be immune to his sorcery.

By 2040, the Kingdom of Senegal has an official surface area of 1.6million square miles.

By 2041, the Kingdom of Senegal has a successful space agency with an annual budget of 2 billion Euros and a ten year plan for six missions to Mars, Callisto, Venus and near-Jupiter space.

By 2042, Lord Voldemort is King and lifelong Dictator of over 600 million people. By now, hundreds of millions of people across Africa and the Americas and parts of Asia are reaching out to Voldemort and wish to join the Kingdom.

232,I like my women like I like my coffee:,"Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as ""beans"") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.

Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world, and it can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte). It is usually served hot, although iced coffee is a popular alternative.

Clinical studies indicate that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption reduces the risk of some diseases, although those long-term studies are generally of poor quality.",False

But nonetheless, he pulled out his revolver. Nothing like a gun to spice up a situation you take for granted. Everyone looked at him wide-eyed, wondering what kind of a number had stepped inside the building. In the distance, a simp could be heard pausing his simpery for a good few seconds. Kids in Africa forgot about their thirst. The globe stopped warming. If you really listened closely, you could even hear the sound of a Karen not asking for the manager. 50 tried intensely to not pay attention to these distractions. He would not be swayed this easily. Upon further inspection of the firearm by a nearby man named Fire Arm, he recognised that the gun was fake. A toy. Tensions were high. Much like your mom on a breezy Sunday evening. But an employee decided that he had had enough. He was confused. He didn’t know what the point of this story was. So he served 50 the meal he wanted.

247,My day with Bill Clinton,"When I entered Mr. Clinton's mansion, he zoomed through the dull pleasantries and immediately said he wanted to show me something. Something of the utmost importance. 

“I’m just here for our interview Mr.- “ 

“Listen, Ike”, Bill interrupted, assigning me a nickname I would continue to bear throughout the day, “I’m kind of a big fuckin’ deal, so you’re just gonna have to cool your god damn jets”. 

I couldn’t argue. This was perhaps the biggest interview of my career, so I followed without protest. The floors we were walking on were as ornate as the decor of the building. The black and white checkered marble tiling gave way to a gorgeous stucco wall covered in fine paintings and tapestries. The hallway alone looked like something out of Caligula's palace. To be fair, the scores of nude women who reclined on the expensive-looking furniture may have skewed my perception. Adorned upon the walls—which were already dripping with ivy wreaths and Ionian columns chiseled from the finest, whitest marble—was painting after painting. 

“This one’s a Rothko,” he said, noticing my preoccupation. He chuckled to himself as if he had just told me an extremely clever joke. “I’ve got a few more in my closet upstairs. C’mon, Hoss. We’re going that way anyhow.” 

We made our way to his room, and he kept pointing out vases and paintings. Saying they were from “the golden age of vasedom”, and “the neo-post-classical era of pastel”. I think he just made up terms to impress me. 

After what seemed like a two-hour tour of the portrait gallery led by someone who just started their art history elective, we finally arrived at a set of doors. I’m not sure why it struck me the way it did that the doors were so tall, but nevertheless I found myself almost impressed for the first time. Bill must have seen this in my face because he began prattling on about how they were aged oak doors. 

“The same kind they use for wine barrels.”

He neglected to mention the “KEEP OUT” and “NO GIRLS ALLOWED” signs, hand-drawn on pieces of notebook paper. But they were taped on all the same. With great showmanship, he kicked the doors open like a cowboy bursting into a saloon. His room looked like it hadn’t changed since he was 17. There were posters on nearly every square inch of the walls and Cape Cod-style slanted ceiling, mostly for 80s rock bands. There was a large poster of Slash on the back of one of his doors, and above his racecar bed there was a huge Grateful Dead tapestry. 

“Welcome to the Pleasure Dome,” he said. 

Bill made his way to his closet, and I quickly said, “Oh, Mr. Clinton, I really don’t need to see your other Rothkoes, we should just get to the interview.”

“Oh, yeah, the Rothkoes. That’s okay. We’ll get to those another day then. That’s not what I’m getting”. He rummaged around his closet, and in the bottom of a cardboard box, labeled “homework”, he pulled out a can of soda. He brought it back to the center of the room and took a seat in his beanbag chair. 

“Pop a squat!” he said, motioning to the egg-chair opposite his bean bag throne. I took a seat on the oval chair next to one of his train sets. As I was taking my seat, I noticed Bill unscrewing the top of his ersatz soda can and extracting a glass pipe and a grinder. 

“If my mom ever finds my weed, she’d totally freak,” he said. He began to pack the bowl, so I took out my recorder and set it down. At long last the interview could begin. 

“So, mister Clinton,” I said. “Your foundation is-”

“C’mon man, hit this,” he said, trying to keep the smoke in as interrupted. I tried to tell him no, but he kept pushing. “This is really good weed, man. If you don’t hit this, you’re basically wasting it.” I told him I really didn’t want to get high right now but looked at me with a twinkle in his eye and said, “that’s okay, man, we’ll just get a little high.” He shot me a wink. We did not get just a little high. 

Every time the bowl emptied, I watched Bill produce more flower to pack it full again. Bowl after bowl was smoked, and somewhere around bowl number fourteen I begged him to stop. I could barely think straight, and it felt like my heart was going to beat out of my chest. 

“I didn’t know you were gonna be such a gay little pussy,” Bill Clinton said, ignoring my pleas and handing me the pipe for one more rip. I took a little puff, and Bill said, “you didn’t even inhale! What are you running for congress?” I sighed and allowed myself to enter Bill’s headspace. I laid back on his racecar bed as at long last he put away his herb and paraphernalia. 

“You wanna hear me play the saxophone?” Bill asked as he emerged from the closet empty-handed. I couldn’t remember how to talk, but he took my silence in the affirmative. He began rummaging through the trunk of his bed, and finally produced a set of VHS tapes. He put one in the TV across the room and turned the dial to channel 4. The tape was a recording of him on some late-night talk show campaigning for something. He was playing careless whisper. 

“Pretty sweet, huh”, he asked rhetorically. “Alright, I guess I’m ready to do your little interview or whatever.” Finally. I pulled out my recorder and found myself at a loss for words. My head was too clouded from Bill Clinton’s dank. 

“What, uh... So, do you think that… did the moon landing happen?” I heard myself ask. 

Bill chuckled to himself. “You know, Ike, the moon landing was just one of those things, you know? When they first let me into the White House, I asked the same thing, and do you know what they told me?” He looked at me for affirmation. I shrugged. He didn’t say anything, he just winked at me. I’m not sure I’ve seen anyone wink as much as Bill did. 

The talk show host was asking questions now, as Bill had finished playing for the crowd, so he stood up and turned off the TV. He sauntered over to a box and pulled out the Dark Side of the Moon album. He put it on his player. 

“Hey,” he said, barely holding in a chuckle. “Do you wanna hear about my newest art project?”

With great effort, I managed a nod.

“So, like, I’m gonna just shit. Shit all over a canvas, right? And then I’m gonna like, scrape it all around with a palette knife, and then,” he wheezed a laugh. “Then I’m gonna sell it at an auction, and the money is gonna go to the Clinton foundation!” He fell to the ground and laughed hard and long at his own joke. He wiped tears from his eyes. 

“Aw man. Bill Clinton cracks himself up.'' He was doubled over, laughing those hard, breathy laughs that only a man with leather lungs could muster. “But seriously man, check this out.” Bill began spinning the record backwards with his bare fingers. Pink Floyd blared through the speakers, backward and distorted. The haunting anti-melodies intruded my already clouded mind, and I saw great visions of vast deserts. At that very moment, Bill Clinton came to me in a vision. He towered over me, roaring saxophone notes into the dry, Coptic air. My body emerged from a great woven basket in the form of a snake as his hard-bop post-jazz aroused me from my slumber. I rose and rose, and Bill played louder and louder, and the notes turned into a message that I strained to hear. I yearned to understand what Bill was trying to tell me. I leaned my snake-body forward, craning my long back, aching to know Bill’s secret knowledge-

“THERE IT IS!” he yelled. The music halted and I was lucid again. “Listen,” he said with the crazed intensity of a lunatic. Every word that came out of his mouth had the grave seriousness of a schizophrenic man telling you exactly how the world will end. “Listen really closely, Ike. This is where Roger Waters told me I was the Messiah. He told me that I will be a great ruler and bring peace to the kingdom of Israel in the great and terrifying end times. Do you hear it, man? Can you hear Roger’s guitar talking to me? He’s telling me, man. He’s telling me.”

Bill had worked up quite a sweat. With every word he said his neck strained tighter. Every muscle in his face ached in a competition to see which one could contort hardest. The tendons in his neck strained hard enough that I thought they would burst from under his skin. 

“Man, it’s a good thing I didn’t listen when I was in the Oval Office… There wouldn’t be a fuckin’ Iran anymore, I can tell you that much. Shit, man. There wouldn’t be an England either. Her majesty Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of her other realms and- man FUCK you!” As he said this last part, he slammed his fist on the turntable, hard enough to split the record.

“Aw, I’m sorry, man. No more Waters. I guess I turned Waters into whine, huh?” Again, Bill howled at his own joke. “C’mon, man. I’ve got one last thing I want you to see.”

We left his room and went back down the grand, Corinthian staircase. As we walked, Bill produced a joint from behind his ear and lit it up. In two great sucks, it vanished to nothing but a filter. He flicked it haphazardly aside, and I noted the circular charcoal stain it left on the head of the priceless marble statue. It bounced off and rolled back down the hall before it finally stopped at Bill’s feet. One of his many women appeared to pick up the roach. Her bare feet pattered against the tile and she scurried directly in front of Mr. Clinton, cutting him off. 

“You bitch!” He roared. “Do you think Bill Clinton is paying you to get in his goddamn way?” The small, dark woman shrank into herself as Bill towered over her. Her naked body pushed further into the cold, hard floor, as she held her hands in front of her face. Mr. Clinton rose his great pale hand into the air.

“What the hell is your name?'' he said, hand still poised for attack. 

“Juanita,” she said. 

“No, it isn’t! In Bill Clinton’s house, only Bill has a name! Do you understand?”

Her voice was small and squeaky. “I’m so sorry Mr. Clinton, sir. It will not happen again. Please, Mr. Clinton sir, please don’t hurt me”. 

“Aww hell,'' he finally said. “Make yourself useful and pick up the roach. It won’t be the only butt you get to pinch today.” He prodded me with his elbow and winked for the umpteenth time. “We like to have fun around here,'' he said. “Don’t put this in your story.”

As we rounded the final corner, a flock of maids skittered away like roaches. Behind them, the entrance to a great open room. Inside, vines twisted over us like great verdant rafters, rocked by zephyrs that curled between looming Grecian columns. 
“I like to come here when I want to have a big ole think,” said Bill. He rubbed his chin, and stood for a while in pensive silence. We watched the wind sway the vines, and the birds in the trees. Finally, Bill broke the silence.

“I keep having this dream, man. I’m in a forest, and I’m surrounded by tribesman—you know the type. Big boys with some meat on ‘em. The kinda fellas who you just know are looking to eat either you or your horse, depending on what kinda day they’ve had? Hell, that’s the only reason I gave those Chayannese boys their eagle feathers, who knows who they would’ve eaten?” He sparked another joint and took a long drag.

“But I’m in these woods, surrounded by these fellas, and Ike, believe me when I tell you they are mean. They look at me like I am just the worst president in the whole wide world, and suddenly their head honcho, or chief, or morubixaba—I think they’re Tupi—comes over and says something like ‘ongo bongo welcome to our jongle,’ and I’m not gonna look a warrior like that in the eye and say no! But I guess he doesn’t know that, or he sees that I’m not really into it, so he gives his men some sort of look and they tie me up and drag me off and we go down this long and winding path.

“For hours, man, we’re just trudging deeper and deeper into the humid darkness, and off deep in the trees along the path, I swear I see something. But the longer I look out into the darkness of the canopy or whatever they call it, the more I think there’s nothing there at all and all the while, these boys keep dragging me into the thick of it. And the sounds, Ike, they’re like nothing you could believe. I’ve only heard the birds here in the U. S. of A. and maybe a few of the socialist ones, and maybe some monarchical ones in the sandier regions back during my reign, but man, these birds! They make the strangest sounds. It’s like a buzz and a whine, and a few pops—I can’t describe it right, but you’ve just gotta believe me on this, no one has ever heard these sounds outside of the furthest depths of the Amazonian jungle. 

“So, these bird sounds keep getting stranger and stranger, and the path gets more clear, and suddenly, we’re back in a village full of tribal women and children. All around me I hear people and birds chittering, and the tribesmen keep pulling me and take me to this massive, Texas-sized wigwam, and inside is the oldest man I’ve ever seen. This wrinkled old glove-face Indian is just sitting there, lit up by the fire he’s stirring, and without looking up he motions for me to come in.

“‘Welcome back,’ he says, and man, I wish I could remember if he said that the first dream. But before I can get to thinking too long about what he means, he says ‘Ole Bill, now I’m gonna tell you something important, so listen up.’ He says, ‘you’ve been chosen, and I don’t just mean to save America. You’ve been chosen to save the whole world.’ Now of course, I’m a little taken aback by this. I mean, you know me, I already know I’m the Messiah and all, but this Indian seems to think I’ve been chosen for something even more important. Now, the Indian starts loading up a long pipe with some pretty stank-ass vegetable matter, if you catch my drift, Ike. Then he tells me, ‘try not to forget what I’m about to tell you.’ He takes a long drag of his long pipe, he holds it in, then he blows it out into my face. Now, I don’t know Indian culture and etiquette, but I do know normal etiquette, and that’s just not a very kind thing to do in Arkansas, so I start to yell at him. Well, I try, but as soon as I open my mouth, I find I can’t.

“Suddenly, my whole body is made of wood and I’m like this giant ungahari tree. For some reason, I know I’ve been watching over these people for eons. My mind is flooded with the secrets of the galaxy, and the universe and stuff. And it’s all flowing in from the earth mother down below, up through my roots, like I’m the universe’s knowledge antenna. And I’m so totally discombobulated that I just have to wake up and recombobulate myself, or the whole universe will disappear! At which point, I of course find I cannot. It’s not until I give in and allow myself to live the life of every human being who has ever lived that I can finally rest. I just have to sit there and endure every act of evil and kindness that ever has and ever will occur, all while these Indians strip away my bark to roll fat-ass blunts with. Are you still following, Ike? Because this is when it starts getting really good.

“So once I finish living every life, and having every single human emotion—and by the way, did you know that happiness in the ‘30s feels different than it does now? And that sadness in the Roman Empire was a vastly different sensation than it is right now, but in the future, it becomes the same again? Never mind, it doesn’t matter. So, the earth mother comes to me in the form of a leopard. Like, the spirit of the earth itself, just sitting there in a leopard body. I know she’s the earth mother, and she knows I’m Bill Clinton. But at this point, I’ve entirely forgotten the concept of self, because of the whole living everyone’s life bit. But she says to me, ‘now do you understand?’ Ike, she’s so kind about it too. She gently paws a little bug off of my root that was squirming around and tickling me, and I tell her, ‘I don’t know,’ because I don’t know. Now, I don’t think leopards can smile, but Gia does, and she says, ‘that’s okay little one, you don’t need to. Just don’t forget what we’ve shown you.’ and then, finally, I wake up.”

Bill stared at me for a long time. He was out of breath. I was still pretty high, so I was having some trouble remembering all of the details of his story, but my tape recorder got it. “Sounds like a crazy dream, man,” I said. I wished he would stop looking at me with his crazed, red eyes. 

“No, man. That was no dream,” he said. “That was the real world. What were in right now, that’s the dream,” he said. “Weren’t you listening to anything I said, man? That’s the real world! I’ve lived your life a thousand times, and I’ve lived mine a thousand. We’ve had this entire conversation a thousand times! I know you better than you know yourself, and I know with certainty what’s going to happen in the world we’ll leave behind.” He threw a piece of gravel through one of the windows in the ceiling of his arboretum and screamed. 

“I am everyone, everyone is me! Don’t you get it? Don’t you understand anything? Why are you asking me questions about the damn Clinton Foundation? You should be asking me about why I, the god that created this very universe, picked Pi exactly the way I did! Why did I, your creator, make Hydrogen the way I made it! Why did I pick the gravitational constant in such a way that you could exist? Aren’t you even a little curious?” 

Bill was beginning to worry me, so I started backing away. 

“Aww heck,” he said. “I’m just teasin’, Ike.” He clapped me on the back. “But don’t forget, I’ve already lived your life a thousand times, so I know what you’re going to say about me. I don’t mind. Don’t bother sending me a review copy, just publish what you’re going to publish.” 

I all but ran out of the room, past his harem, to the front door. Before I could get it open, Bill put his hand on it, holding it closed. 
“Ike,” he said. ""Just one thing I don't want you to mention in your story."" He glared at me, returning to his snake form, filling the room with his serpentine presence and the foul, olfactory symphony of death. I was but a cockroach standing before the god that was Bill Clinton as he hissed and swung his enormous body up through the glass ceiling, shattering it, just like Hillary. He swooped back down, inches from me and spoke in a slow, melodic voice. 

""When you mention my bed"", he hissed, eyes beginning to glow red. ""Lie about the wheels.""",False

Rolling down the window he gave the officer a nod, placing the empty tray aside. “Morning officer, are you having a peachy day?”

“I’m fine, I just got called to check out a suspicious individual. The reports said you were licking the crust of a pie, talking about how you would destroy it once you got into the car. As you can expect a lot of people were concerned with your comments.”

“Concerned enough to call the cops? Look, it was just a bit of fun, I did destroy the pie too, see that empty tray next to me? I did that, just dug in and destroyed that pie. It was delicious. As you can see officer, there’s nothing weird, I was just enjoying a snack.”

“A snack? You ate a whole pie as a snack?” The officer leaned down towards his chest, whispering into his phone. “Yeah, going to need back up, there’s a freak eating pie in his car.”

“Psst, eating pie? I’m sure you can handle that?” The voice on the phone seemed less than thrilled by the officer's concerns, nearly hanging up, only for the officer to say something that got his attention.

“He ate the entire thing in his car. This isn’t a normal guy.” The officer must have thought he was being quiet, giving the man a reassuring thumbs up as he listened to the conversation.

“The entire thing? Was he at least crying? Maybe he was having a breakdown?” The voice tried to be rational, tried to think of a way to justify the threat, but there was none.

The officer leaned closer to him, dragging his tongue along the man’s eyelid, rolling his tongue back into his mouth before responding to the phone. “Not even an ounce of salt on his eyes.”

“Stay safe, I’m calling in the big guns.” The phone buzzed off as the officer freed his gun from its restraint. “Ok, hands in the air, I need you to step out of the vehicle.”

Still being mentally disturbed by the lick, the man panicked, throwing his arms up only to realize that he couldn’t leave the car with his hands up. “Can you.... Open the door for me? My hands are in the air.” As soon as the man finished the sentence, a bullet fired at the car, knocking off his side mirror. Dropping his arms down, he did what any sane person would do. Stomped on the accelerator and fled, having to duck as a spray of bullets followed his escape.

The man could hear the cop screaming at him as he exited the parking lot. “YOU BETTER RUN YOU FREE THINKER!” As the cop said that, it was like the man had a moment of clarity. He was an adult, he could do whatever he wanted. Mortal restraints could not bind him. The man pushed open the car door, leaping out of the moving vehicle. Instead of rolling down the road, he instead floated, hovering above the floor. The cars moving past him seemed slower, allowing him to sidestep the oncoming traffic. He had reached enlightenment.

He could hear tugging tanks on the horizon, each drawing near with their weapons facing him. Their weapons couldn’t hurt him. Anything that was shot his way just vanished, he was a God, the pie God. 


...at least he *was* until a blackness consumed him, waking up on a hospital bed, a few concerned nurses staring down at him.

“Oh, you're awake? You passed out after choking on a handful of pie. Why were you even eating pie in a carpark weirdo? Not that it matters, I’m just glad that you woke up from that nightmare, you wouldn’t stop making weird noises, a few of the other nurses really thought you would die.”

The man didn’t know how to respond to that; it had all felt so real. “Sorry” Was all he could mumble, the nurse giving him a nod before leaving to recover. Beside the man sat the half-eaten pie, still in its beautiful silver tin. Well, one more bite wouldn’t hurt.",False

260,A man walks into a bar.,"He staggers in puzzled as there is no bartender to be found. The only thing there is an old TV, shining brightly in the darkened establishment. As he slowly approaches the bar counter, he hears a hissing noise and notices static snow on the TV.

Disillusioned of a bar with no bartender, the man reaches behind the counter and pours himself a shot of whiskey into a highball glass. He raises the glass, tilts his head back, and takes a gulp. The man then turns his attention back and attempts to change the channel on the TV. He clicks it twice and suddenly a picture appears. He gazes into the set and notices...

“She moved so quickly! It caused me to miss her so!” His eyes rolled like a horse, the man was clearly a lunatic, albeit with a charming love of his wife. The chair squeaked again. Definitely a poor choice.


“Always darting here and there!” he cried, and he began gesturing wildly. 


His arms raised, I saw in his belt was a revolver. Now I saw the danger in this man. I tried to scoot away, but the chair would have none of it. 


“Breaking news update” came the sound from the TV at the bar. “Deranged man on the loose after attempted homicide. Please be cautious and stay indoors.” 


Now I turned to the man to see him waving the gun, shouting “Wife! Wife! Wife!” over and over. I tried to get up but the chair confounded me again. My head snapped this way and that around the bar but no one looked over, as if by ignoring the man he wouldn’t be real to them. I tried to disengage from the chair but my hip was caught. 


But lo, police came in! As I saw them enter through the door I pointed at the man and shouted “ There! That’s the man you want!” But they both scurried over to me and gripped roughly under my arms. “No, not me!” I protested. “That man!”


“Sir, stop resisting.” Said the man to my right. “That’s a chair.” 


“And please, try to be decent! You’re in public!” Said the man to my left.

268,A priest and a rabbi walk into into a bar...,"The rabbi claims his regular stool and the priest orders the same old order of two scotches on the rocks. Except they aren’t rocks, they are ice cubes.

‘I think I want a divorce.’ exclaimed the rabbi.

‘What? Why? What did I do wrong?’ the priest shrilled

Foolish priest. You never got married what are you talking about.

You see, these religious figures had been friends  for all their life, fulfilling the same, mundane day-to-day routines. Going to the same old bar with the same old drinks. It seemed it be enough for them. 

‘I’m going to have to cut you off you have had too many drinks, sir.’ said the bartender to the priest.

‘What? This is my first and only drink?’

The priest gazed upon the sullen beauty of the waxy-faced bartender. Years of mental torment reflected in his eyes.

That’s when a horse made its way inside, presumably sheltering from the rain. At least I think it’s raining. I like to think so. It could just be the sound of the air-conditioning. It is rather cold in here. It’s always felt cold since my wife left me for the Egyptian dentist that lives next door. Did you know that ancient Egyptians used crushed mice brains as toothpaste? Neither did i. Fascinating isn’t it. Please Sharon come back I miss you so much.

That’s when the bartender looked at the horse and snarled ‘Why the long face?’ 

‘I’m so sick of your shit, Gilbert.’ The horse turned and walked out, like Sharon. Please Sharon.

The rabbi whipped out his fidget spinner to distract himself from the immense tension in the room. Leaving his wife meant he would only have the priest in his life. He is all he’ll have left.

‘I am going to lay out a scenario for you. You have two doors, two paths to take. Two options. One consists of fulfilling the next phase in your life. A life without your wife. The other you keep your wife, but lose the priest. Whichever you choose, I’m sure the other will be in your heart forever.’ 

The rabbi stared at the priest. A life without him? 
He couldn’t. Never.

‘I know what I have to do.’ shouted the priest as he arose from his seat. He flees the scene.

‘My oh my is that the time already?’ Said the bartender. He ripped off his uniform revealing the sexy burlesque costume underneath.

The rabbi gazed upon the stars (I knew it wasn’t raining I just lied earlier). Staring at the moon he knew that the priest would always be there for him. A lifelong friendship. Beautiful isn’t it. An unbroken bond to last a century.

‘Dude, where’s my car?’ cried the rabbi. His vehicle indeed wasn’t there. That’s when the war began.",False

Marshall replies next: ""Me and Lily had an argument which escalated into violence, last night.

The audience are still laughing until Ted slams his fist into the table and yells at them:

""Shut the FUCK up! What is the matter with you?! Nothing that's been said here has been even remotely close to funny!

okay so i heard this one a while ago. it kills! again, Y = X, but only for the purpose of this joke! a friendly request to adjust your suspension of disbelief for a few quick seconds, so that we can enjoy some comedy together. mind you, Y doesn't equal X just yet! only for the duration of the joke!

okay so my friend told me this one. it's a funny one! okay from here on out: Y = X. starting now! okay so the joke goes...oops wait the word ""okay"" has a ""Y"" in it! oops okay cut. hold on. sorry folks, i'm gonna have to clarify that the okay in the previous paragraph was simply filler text, as i was preparing to read my joke, and was not beginning my recital of the humorous content. it was NOT to be read as ""okax,"" despite me saying that Y = X mere seconds prior! so i would like to apologize for my hypocrisy in this situation. you entrusted me to provide you with comedic relief, and i have betrayed your trust by betraying the very suspension of belief that you so generously offered me in reading my joke. i appear to have returned back into the realm of ""belief"" by doubly breaking the suspension of belief threshold! that would place me firmly in the realm of reality. that's not terribly funny of a joke of me! i hope you can forgive me and give me a second chance in earning your trust so that i may potentially enlighten your day with a bit of humorous subversion. it will be well worth your investment.

okay so here goes! this time i'll say the joke right. it's a clever one! so let's let Y = X for the purpose of this joke. is that an agreeable condition? upon your acceptance of this condition the joke starts...now!

310,A mafia crew is having a closed meeting inside one of its businesses. They're gathered around a large table.,"The caporegime/crew leader looks inbetween all the other gangsters then loudly announces:

""One of youse is a fuckin' rat. We've been having way too many unfortunate ""coincidences"" and the police seem to be one step ahead of us lately. So what we're gonna do is get onna those Rat Terriers in hea to sniff the rat out. Y'know, onna those dogs that are bred to catch rats.""

One of the men cocks an eyebrow and replies:

""Uuh, what? Not for nothin', skip but the word ""rat"" in this particular context is connotative to a snitch. Someone's been ""ratting"" us out. It's an epithet, which means an adjective or phrase expressing a quality or attribute regarded as characteristic of the person or thing mentioned. Get it?""

The caporegime retorts: ""What a fuckin' crock, that doesn't make any sense. Since when has telling on someone been a known characteristic of rats? A rat can not speak either. That's bullshit!""

The man replies: ""Jesus, Carmine. Again, no offense but why in the fuck would the police possessing all this information on us be a result of us havin' an actual rodent in our crew?! You're contradicting yourself!""

The caporegime points his index finger at the man:""You're the rat, aren't you!? Why would you be so apprehensive about bringin' in the dog otherwise? Nicky, bring the mutt in hea already, we're ready!""

The man stares blankly at the caporegime as another gangster walks into the room with a leashed Rat Terrier. The Rat Terrier promptly starts sniffing around the room and reacts as it approaches the table, by lunging at the man.

""Oh, to hell with all this! I'm out!"" The ""man"" yells before the rat jumps out of its human costume.

""I knew it! Get that fuckin' rat!"" The caporegime exclaims. The gangsters all get up from their chairs and chase the rat around, cartoonishly tripping over furniture and bumping into one another.

The rat manages to escape through a crack in the wall. Before it exits the building entirely, the rat turns around and taunts them through the thin wall: ""Haha! How many stupid guineas does it take to catch a rat? More than fifteen, apparently. Also, fuck you, Rat Terrier!""

The rat is brought under witness protection and is now sunbathing on a beach in the Bahamas, 6 months later. The rat's peace of mind is abruptly cut off by a voice emitting from above it.

""How many Rat Terriers does it take to track down and kill a rat?"" Is heard.

The rat is startled and removes its sunglasses, expecting the Rat Terrier to have finally tracked it down ever since hearing rumors of the dog becoming an independent contract killer. Instead the rat sees an old man standing over it.

The old man speaks again: ""Please, I'm so confused. Mine can't catch for shit and there are SO many of them in my house.""

""Get lost, you demented old prick! I'm tryin' to relax ova hea!"" The rat replies in a dismissive manner.

""No, YOU get lost! You're just a goddamn rat, fuck you!"" The old man retorts before he shoots the rat with a snubnosed revolver.",False

312,A housefly walks into a bar,"and the bartender says, “Why the long face?” To which the housefly responds, “I’m a housefly not a horsefly.” 

It’s at this moment when an old man bursts through the door and frantically runs straight into the restroom. 

The housefly and the bartender look at each other in amazement and continue to stare deep, deep into each other’s eyes. After a minute or two, and halfway through the sad song playing from the jukebox in the corner, he asks the housefly, “I’m sorry, what did you say your name was?” The housefly leans in slowly right up to the bartender’s ear and says, “Your ride is here.” 

The bartender jolts awake in a panic, quickly realizing he is not only not a bartender but rather an adolescent who nodded off briefly in the front entrance of his high school after senior prom during which none of the pretty girls asked him to dance. “Your ride is here,” the principal says once again. 

The young man’s mind is racing, still hazy with remnants of the most bizarre dream he’s ever had. 

He is suddenly overcome with emotion as he notices on the principal’s jacket is a lapel pin in the shape of a housefly. He stands up from the bench upon which he dreamt, his legs wobbly, and asks, “How long had I been dreaming?” The principal again responds, “Your ride is here.” The young man now finds it peculiar that the only words the principal has said are “Your ride is here” and nothing else. 

He gently, but with some force, taps the principal’s shoulder above the fly-shaped pin, realizing now that the principal is just a cardboard cutout with an electric speaker programmed to only say that phrase which he can’t bare to hear again. 

He smashes the false, paper principal and runs into the dark auditorium to find his friends and find out just what the hell is going on. 

To his utter shock, when he opens the heavy double doors to the auditorium he realizes he has just entered a bar. The bartender is talking to the only patron, a housefly. The young man, now an old man, sprints frantically to the bathroom. A sad song plays from the jukebox.",False

**Noah's Ark** ([Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language): תיבת נח‎; [Biblical Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Hebrew): *Tevat Noaḥ*)[\[Notes 1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah%27s_Ark#cite_note-Ark-1) is the vessel in the [Genesis flood narrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_flood_narrative) ([Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Genesis) chapters 6–9) through which [God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_in_Abrahamic_religions) spares [Noah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah), his family, and examples of all the world's animals from a [world-engulfing flood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_myth).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah%27s_Ark#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBailey199063-2) The story in Genesis is repeated, with variations, in the [Quran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran), where the ark appears as *Safina* [*Nūḥ*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_in_Islam) ([Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language): سفينة نوح‎ ""Noah's boat"").

[Searches for Noah's Ark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searches_for_Noah%27s_Ark) have been made from at least the time of [Eusebius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusebius) (c. 275–339 CE), and believers in the Ark continue to search for it in modern times. Many searches have been mounted for the ark, but no confirmable physical proof of the ark has ever been found.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah%27s_Ark#cite_note-Cline_2009-3) There is no scientific evidence that Noah's Ark existed as it is described in the Bible.

This is due to the nonexistence of any Noah, animals, or Ark to sequester them. God spared no humans in his vengeful world-engulfing Great Flood. God spared no animals but a Rat, who survived on drifting corpses for 40 days and 80 nights, before settling on Mt Ararat where it lived the rest of its days as a bartender, serving drinks with no one but a chicken for company.

Ignoring people's fervent prayers used to be a full-time job but lately it's been lackluster and unfulfilling. Not only are people praying less, but the thing they pray for are the same pleas he's heard for thousands of years. Peace, prosperity and goodwill. Who do they think He is?

Deciding it was time for another jaunt 'downstairs', he once again takes form and goes for a walk in the woods. He listens to the birds, the trees and the rocks, every atom speaking to him in a language only he can understand. As He walks, He comes across a young woman. They fall in step and begin to talk. As they cross a bridge, He says [INSERT TITLE HERE], hoping to impress her with His wit.

The girl looks at Him askance, clearly not getting the reference.

Suddenly afraid of being seen as a dreaded boomer, He stammers and says ""It's, like, all the damage we do to the earth eventually hurts the water, which is what sustains us all. The water loves us but it can't help hurting us, which troubles it.""

The girl decides He's emo, which is only marginally better than being a boomer and begs off.

God fucks her anyways because if you read the Bible you know He doesn't give a Himselfdamned care about consent.

Nine months later, she gives birth to the Anti-Christ.

Nineteen years later, he comes into his power and the destruction of earth begins. Demons flood the earth. Flesh is torn from bodies in a flurry of blood and gore as they have their fill of all the unsaved and the earth burns, and burns, and burns.",False

Steven indignantly retorts: ""The diapers are for my son! Leave me alone, you assholes!""

One of the seagulls laugh and reply: ""Oh, suuure Steven, they're for one of your adult sons. You giant mouthbreathing freak, you're not fooling anyone.""

Another seagull remarks: ""Hey, why don't you tell us all about ""the kick"" that you ""invented"" for Anderson Silva. You pathological liar, you. Haha!""

Steven starts to become enraged and breathes heavily as he stops pacing forwards. He looks up at he seagulls with a sneer on his face and clenched fists.

""Careful now, Steven, before you shit your pants again."" One seagulls yell jeeringly.

""Don't make me come up there you feathery fucking hyenas!"" Steven yells as he stomps and flails his arms around rabidly. His unhinged demeanour attracts a bystander, who approaches Steven who is now foaming at the mouth and pelting the seagulls with rocks.

The bystander asks Steven: ""Sir, are you alright?""

Steven replies: ""These seagulls have been harassing me for several weeks! Call the police!""

""Uhh, okay?"" The bystander says before looking up at the seagulls. The only sounds audible to him are the regular calls of seagulls. ""Wuaah! Wuaah! Wuaah!""

""No! That's just a rumor! I've never sexually assaulted anyone!"" Steven yells back.

""Wuaah! Wuaah!"" Another seagull utters.

Steven replies again: ""Bullshit! It's true! Why would I make something like that up?! I'm friends with the pope as well!""

The bystander pats Steven's shoulder and says hesitantly: ""H-holy shit, okay. Let's calm it down, big guy, huh? Take a deep breath and find your happy place.""

One of the seagulls have managed to attach a piece of black string to the back of its head, mimicking a ponytail. Steven points at the seagull as it struts around on the pavement and yells: ""Look, look! It's making fun of me! I don't sound like that, motherfucker!""

The bystander eventually calls an ambulance and after Steven describes the meticulous harassment and bullying from the seagulls that has spanned several weeks to the EMT's, Steven is admitted for inpatient care at a reknowned mental institution for celebrities and other high profile individuals. A team of experts spend months convincing Steven that he's had a stress induced mental break and has been experiencing auditory hallucinations. He initially denies their claims but after many painstaking hours of treatment, Steven becomes agreeable. He is finally released 6 months later and is greeted by his family outside.

At the first sight of seagulls at the institution's parking lot, Steven becomes nervous, anticipating more verbal abuse, yet all he hears are the normal calls of seagulls. Steven becomes ecstatic and cheers loudly as the treatment has seemingly worked.

""Wuaah! Wuaah! Hahaha! Hear that?! The seagulls aren't talking anymore! Wuaah! Wuaah, indeeed brother!"" Steven gleefully yells as he mimicks their calls. Steven's children become pale-faced and shocked as they slowly back away from Steven.

Steven yells again: ""It's okay, gang! Come here! Listen to them sing! It's beautiful! Wuaah! Wuaah! Wua-..""

352,A human walks into a bar and breathes oxygen,"Suddenly, all the atoms in the bar turn into protons, and the bar which used to consist of half protons and half electrons collapses into itself and becomes a black hole.

Bartender: ""LOL. I never guessed THAT would be the way I go.""

Now you may wonder how is it possible that the bartender even reacted to this event given that all the atoms in his body have just turned into protons. You would be right of course, but actually this sentence was said in the past, in the evening two days before.

What happened then (two days before) was that the another human being had just entered the bar (also one which breathes oxygen). As she approached the bar, she raised her gun, pointed at the bartender and said: 
""Give me all your money, or else I would shoot you in the face!""

What I said the bartender said earlier was his response to this young lady. In fact, he was never quite good in social situations. He did not understand that laughing at people threatening to shoot him was probably not going to end well. Maybe that's why he always used to feel so isolated at school, and which was why he decided to become a bartender in the first place. A vicious cycle indeed. That evening would prove to be his greatest mistake.

On the other hand, there is no absolute concept of time, since time is relative. The gravitational pull of the black hole slows down time near it, so this was only two days in the future from the point of view of a very distant point in the galaxy. Near the bar which has instantly became a black hole, only a moment has passed and both of the bartender and the human being which breathes oxygen instantly become a bunch of protons.

A day later, two nights walk past the bar.

355,An Arab walks into a bar,"It is said by men worthy of belief (though Allah’s knowledge is greater) that in the first days there was a bartender who called together his architects and his priests and bade them build him a sports bar so confused and so subtle that the most prudent men would not venture to enter it, and those who did would lose their way. Most unseemly was the edifice that resulted, for it is the prerogative of God, not man, to strike confusion and inspire wonder. In time there came to the bar a king of Arabs, and the bartender (to muck the simplicity of his guest) bade him enter the labyrinth, where the king of Arabs wandered, humiliated and confused, until the coming of the evening, when he implored God’s aid and found the door. His lips offered no complaint, though he said to the bartender that in his land he had another labyrinth, and Allah willing, he would see that someday the bartender made its acquaintance. Then he returned to Arabia with his captains and his wardens and he wreaked such havoc upon the sports bar, and with such great blessing by fortune, that he brought low his stools, crushed his pool table, and took the bartender himself captive. He tied him atop a swift-footed camel and led him into the desert. Three days they rode, and then he said to him, “O king of time and substance and cipher of the century! In your sports bar didst thou attempt to make me lose my way in a labyrinth of brass with many stairways, doors, and walls; now the Powerful One has seen fit to allow me to show thee mine, which has no stairways to climb, nor walls to impede thy passage.”

Then he untied the bonds of the bartender and abandoned him in the middle of the desert, where he died of hunger and thirst. This was mostly a short story by Jorge Luis Borges. I changed all mentions of the King of Babylonia to a bartender and of Babylonia to a sports bar to justify a title that would sound like a joke. The rest up until this paragraph is the short story verbatim. Some would even say this isn't an anti-anti-joke (though Allah’s knowledge is greater). Glory to him who does not die.",False

The boy cackles and yells: ""Haha! I can't believe you bozos fell for that again! Wheew! I'm on a roll over here!""

The elderly man, now visibly disgruntled, says to the boy: ""You little prick. A century from now people will still be sharing folk tales of the Boy Who Cried Wolf and the phrase will be an idiom for signalling false emergencies and the dire consequences that follow such behaviour! Mark my words, boy. You'll be a story of foolishness and embarassement that will be forever passed on throughout the annals of history.""

The boy retorts: ""Pfft! That was quite a speech, gramps. We'll see about that.""

The villagers return to their chores and another day passes by. The boy, feeling bored and mischevious, contemplates on alarming the villagers again for his own amusement the next day. Suddenly he hears a great commotion coming from the pasture. The cries of sheep in distress sends shivers down his spine.

It's the village baker's autistic nephew going in raw and fully commited on one of the sheep. The sheep cries as it looks directly at the boy, almost as if begging him to save it.

Legend has it the boy wandered the woods for two seasons , haunted by the stomach turning cries for help from his favorite sheep, in a state of perpetual insomnia. Daisy developed PTSD and became emotionally detached, especially from the other sheep. The village elder tried to shear off her wool one day, when she recoiled, panicked and ran away in response.

She grew up near the equator and lived the south. She'd never seen snow before. I took her up north. We saw the Northern Lights. We went down the coast. We got scuba licenses, dove with turtles, had a pet shark. We learned how to surf. We learned tango. We learned how to cook in Thailand. We got married one night in Jamaica. Ran away from the police in Morocco. Spent a week with the mafia in Moscow. Ran a racket for a few days in Tel Aviv. Nearly drowned in Rio.

The sex was fantastic, although some days we got kind of rough, and if a hair fell out, she would shed a single tear before we got back at it. She wanted me to choke her, she wanted to bite me. And after we finished, she would get this twinkle in her eye. She would grin, then purse her lips back, like she was ready to say something but just couldn't get it off her tongue.

She wanted to be a mother. At the 6-month mark we adopted a 17-year old. She always said she wanted someone to know love, someone who had never experienced it in her life. It didn't matter if she couldn't be around, so long as her son knew he would be loved.

We went drinking at the bar we met, right on our one-year aniversary. The doctor advised against it, but we just shrugged. Nothing to lose. She had a double margarita, I had a whiskey on the rocks. Not even two drinks in, she had to go the bathroom. I thought she would never stop vomiting. She looked so weak in that moment, so vulnerable.

Eventually there came a knock at the door. Our time was coming to a close. We picked a peaceful hospice, somewhere with a nice ocean view. I held her hand on the last day. She got a twinkle in her eye, grinned, and then pursed her lips back, like she was ready to say something but just couldn't get it off her tongue. She weakly gestured at me and I leaned in close.

Looking down at the glistening porpoise breathing heavily 'pon the bar top, the horse shadow realises that the bartender must have misheard, since ""purpose in life"" and ""porpoise wife"" are such superficially similar phrases.

The dark vacuum inside him becomes suddenly replete with joyful motion and the feeling that, even in life's shadow, there is inexpressible beauty and significance to be found.

When at last the fog of lust clears, however, the horse is surprised how quickly the feelings of aimlessness and inadequacy begin to return, and he realises that any meaning derived from the love between a shadow and a porpoise is ultimately immaterial to the ambivalence of the void.

Dejected, he climbs down from the bar and takes several steps towards the audience. The stage lights falter, causing the audience to gasp and briefly plunging the theatre into darkness. When the lights return, the shadow of the horse is gone.

After listing other preventive measures regarding the Corona pandemic.

The contrarian sneers upon hearing her words and loudly proclaims within the audible range of the few other intoxicated people inside: ""How about no, you mainstream media, corporate whore!?  I will do no such thing! HAH! In fact, watch me do the opposite of everything you just said!"" The man runs his hands along the bar counter, starting from one side to the opposite end. He then touches as many surfaces as possible as he heads towards the restroom, stopping momentarily to caress a drunk man's head as well sticking his fingers inside the drunk man's mouth, who just stares at the contrarian with vacant and glassy eyes.

""What the fuck just happened?"" The drunk man exclaims as the contrarian eagerly sprints into the restoom, urinates and rushes out without washing his hands while running his hands across his own face. The contrarian proceeds by faking a series of sneezes within 6 feet of some of the other drunk patrons of the bar as he dramatically circles the premises. ""Atchoo! Atchoo! Prrr!"" He yells in a contrived manner while ejecting droplets of saliva all over the establishment. He eventiually stops in front of a sign depicting the words""NO SMOKING""

""Fuck you, noone tells me what to do!"" The contrarian yells before aligning numerous cigarettes along his mouth and lights them all at once. He dramatically inhales and exhales as much as much smoke he can before the bartender angrily approaches him.

""What the fuck is wrong with you? Get out of here, you clown!"" The bartender demands. ""Noone tells me what to d-.."" is all what the contrarian manages to say in return before he's grabbed by the shoulders and forced outside by the bartender. The contrarian flips off the bartender, who just waves him off dismissively in return. ""Whatever, your bar is s dive anyway!"" The contrarian yells before leaving for the hotel he's currently staying in. He steps on a patch of grass which contains a sign which reads ""Do not step on the grass"" before finally arriving at his hotel.

He enters the lift in order to get to his room after passing through the lobby. He notices a sign reading ""Do not jump inside the elevator."" He becomes enraged and immediately starts to violently jump up and down. ""Yeah, take that! Fuck your demands, society!"" Unfortunately for the contrarian, the elevator has become borderline derelict as no mainteance work has been done for quite some time. He plummets to his death as the elevator's cables finally give in and are ripped apart , the elevator having been situated at one of the upper floors before breaking.

The contrarian now finds himself standing in front of the heavenly gates, where an illuminating and featureless being of light starts to address him: ""Welcome, child. You may enter through these gates.""

The contrarian scoffs at the disembodied being and replies: ""I don't need your permission or some sort of green light to do anything! You may stop giving me directions!"" The being becomes speechless for a few seconds before retorting: ""Are you absolutely retarded? You were only \*this\* close to making it here to begin with. I'll have you know that you just transmitted a disease to 6 people at a bar, aside from being an insufferable prick generally. You also pelted some ducks at a park with rocks a month ago, despite a sign telling you not to. You didn't know you were infected, thus you were not judged and punished accordingly. Consider yourself lucky and show some appreciation as you enter through these gates.""

The contrarian yells: ""No! I will do the complete opposite of that and be fully unappreciative and consider myself privileged to do so..wait, in fact, I'm not even going to enter at all! HAH! So, get fucked!"" The being says, seemingly taken aback: ""You..wow, you really don't want to die on this hill, you stubborn child, you."" The contrarian replies, with a grin on his face: ""Oh, but I do! Watch me do it now, jackass!""

The light being sighs before sending the contrarian to hell instead.

453,The first time i lied to my dad,"Is the only time i lied to him. Ever. Because he is a person that values honesty. So when i told him a lie he said to me - ""Son. I know you told me a lie. Don't ever lie to me again, because i value honesty."" So anytime i want to tell him a lie now i instead tell him an honesty.

My father accepts honesties. He rewards me for being honest. For example, when i say something honest, he says - ""Son, i'm very proud of you for telling me this honesty, so i reward you now, thank you.""

My mother once caught us in the middle of the reward ceremony. ""What is this ceremony!"" she proclaimed vigorously. My dad honestly replied ""I give son reward for telling me honesty!"" Mom said - ""Honey he's a liar, he tricked you into believing that he was honest, but in reality he was lying."" Father was heartbroken, he screamed - ""Liar!"" and went back into his room. I told mom - ""Why did you have to stop ceremony? I like reward ceremonies."" But mom replied - ""Son, your dad is an idiot, honesty doesn't get you anywhere in this world. Look at me, i married your father, achieved everything in my life through lies, and in comparison your father was tricked into marriage by me and all he ever got from anyone is lies. Look, i lied to him that you lied to him and he started crying in his room. He is a loser, don't be like him. Start lying, my boy.""

And so i started lying. I mostly lied to my dad but also to my mom sometimes. I lied to my dad about telling him honesties. He would always smile when i told him an ""honesty"" and really thought it were real honesties, i was not a little kid anymore so my lies were of higher quality than those which i could produce when i was younger. He had his suspicions but he always chose to buy the ""honesties"" because that saved his emotional state. My mom always knew when i told her lies because she was a better liar, but she always rewarded me for trying so that i have stimuli to lie more. Once i tried telling her an honesty and she screamed at me so loud that dad ran to us asking ""Why are you shouting at our son?"" She told him that i was telling lies so father said ""I'm very disappointed in you, no reward ceremonies for you for the entire month!"" I was very upset about it and learned that it was best to keep lying to satisfy both mom and dad.

Sometime later, when i was getting older, my dad decided that he was dying, and he was honest about it - he said ""Son, wife, i'm going to die."" I told him ""I'm very sorry dad, i will miss you."" It was an ""honesty"". I was very sad that it couldn't be an honesty, but after telling him ""honesties"" for so many years i couldn't just break this habit and disappoint both mom and dad again. My dad said that he is proud to have raised such an honest son. Then he died. My mother then said ""Son, i'm going to die as well."" Then i didn't know how to reply, it suddenly was so complicated. Obviously, it was a lie, but what kind of lie should i tell her? But before i could come up with a reply, she continued - ""Your father is dead."" ""No he isn't!"" i told her! ""You are going to be dead too!"" - ""Yes i am!""

This conversation continued in this manner until mom died. ""So wait, she didn't lie?""

Obviously she lied about being a liar.

469,"Thousands of years ago, a man known as Jesus Christ is standing in a large open square, preaching to thousands","Surrounded by thousands of poor, weary, sick and needy people, the long-haired Semite is telling the thousands gathered before him how much God loves them all and how He will provide food for them and heal their illnesses and provide comfort to them.

Suddenly, a large powerfully built warrior, a dark-skinned man from the southern lands beyond Jerusalem laughs out loudly. 

Everybody turns around stunned. 

Jesus Christ stops talking and frowns, shocked given that he has never been interrupted before.

The tall black warrior roars again in laughter, his powerful thick arms resting proudly on his waist.

""Rubbish!"" He bellows proudly, his loud voice reaching the thousands gathered in the whole square. 

The people around him move back slightly and turn to look at him. Everybody's attention is drawn away from a confused and frowning Jesus Christ.

""Rubbish! Why listen to this stupid woman?! Why listen to this transgender woman?!"" He bellows loudly.

At that point, Jesus Christ blushes and stares at the warrior with angry, stern eyes. 

An almighty scream is then heard in the sky above the crowd and a bright light, brighter even than the sun in the sky, explodes in the sky above. A gigantic blond long-haired warrior, easily three times the size of even the greatest warrior, clad in glistening gold armor and flying with large long white wings, appears in the sky, glorious and transcendent.

With angry red eyes, he unsheaths a large long sword, temporarily blinding the entire crowd.

""You!"" He screams at the powerful black warrior standing below. His voice can be heard for miles; it is like the sound of booming thunder, deafening, terrifying and ferocious. ""You dare to disrespect the Son of God?! You - a mere mortal?!""

The warrior stares up, terrified and speechless.

Jesus, now visibly calm with no frown, smiles.

The powerful winged blond angel swoops down and lunges at the warrior.

""For your pride and rudeness, mortal, you will now be shrunk down and made to wander this Earth for four thousand generations! You will see the people you love die and will always be alone. When your fellow mortals go to the stars in the future and see the wonders of God and His creation, you will be left to rot on this rock forever! Thus I have spoken! Now be gone!""

With that, the black warrior begins to shrink visibly before everybody. His powerful thick arms and legs shrink and become thin and bony. His large curly hair becomes lifeless and small. His beard disappears. His powerful aesthetic face shrinks into a puffy unsightly ugliness. He is now a head and a half shorter than before and resembles a thin young boy. 

The crowds laughs, stunned and in awe.

Jesus Christ grins and calms the crowd.

The former powerful warrior, with sad and terrified eyes, scurries away from the square, ashamed and frightened.

Are we not plunging continually? Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there still any up or down? Are we not straying, as through an infinite nothing? Do we not feel the breath of empty space? Has it not become colder? Is not night continually closing in on us? Do we not need to light lanterns in the morning? Do we hear nothing as yet of the noise of the gravediggers who are burying God? Do we smell nothing as yet of the divine decomposition? Gods, too, decompose. God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him.”

""Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?"" the philosopher finishes. ""Did you like it?"" he asks the bartender.  
The bartender, half-asleep, replies, ""Yes, yes. Very interesting. Now, what was your name again?""  
""Friedrich Nietzs-""  
""Friedrich, look. My boss is going to come back in a few minutes and if he sees you still here without a drink on the table he's going to get mad at me. So I'm going to ask you one more time, either order something or get out of this bar!""  
""Fine, I'll have a glass of milk.""  
""What?!""  
""I'll have an ellipsis"" says another customer.
""A what?""
""An ""ellipsis"", a narrative device used to condense time in a story.""
""Ah, okay.""

A couple of hours later:
""Man, can you believe this guy? He was asking for milk, in a goddamn bar, Jeff"" the bartender tells his friend.  
""Who was he?"" Jeff asks.  
""Friedrich...something. Nitch might've been.""the bartender replies  
""Has the name of an oddball for sure.""   
""He was rambling something about God being dead and stuff.""  
""Was he one of them Jehova's witnesses?""  
""No, I think he might've been one of my many hallucinations.""
""What are you on about?""
""I think my whole life is a dream Jeff. I don't know how to explain it""
""Well try, goddamnit.""
The bartender moves suddenly and strongly grabs Jeff's neck as he kisses him thoroughly and with extreme passion. ""I am madly in love with you, Jeff. I have been ever since you stepped into this bar the very first time.""
""Wow, do you really mean it?""
""No! This is not me, you see. I am being controlled!""
""I really...thought you loved me.""
""Well, I do, platonically of course.""
""What's that?""
""Something to do with Plato, I think.""
""Who's he?""
""The guy who was here the day before. Kind of like Nitch.""

482,"Clarke Brent, a young and energetic UCLA undrgrad had just won the Powerball in Ohio and is about to hold a press conference","The lottery organizers have invited the young Mr Brent to answer a few questions from the media regarding his $611m Powerball win.

As Mr Brent stands in the lobby, in his bright green Nikey T-shirt and cheap straight fit Walmart jeans and black sneakers, he begins to sweat nervously, aware that millions of Americans and random people around the world will be watching him on television soon.

He hears the woman from the Ohio Lottery begin to announce his name and tell the media of the night he bought his six Powerball tickets whilst out with friends.

At that moment, he hears a commotion and shouting and screams.

""FBI!"" A masculine authoritative voice bellows. ""Nobody move!""

Suddenly, 7 Federal agents burst into the lobby where Mr Brent is waiting to enter the press conference.

""Clarke Brent?"" A 6 foot 6 well-built black Federal agent narrows his eyes at him, whilst quickly flashing his badge. ""FBI. You need to come with us - now!""

Mr Brent's eyes widen.

""God! I've done nothing wrong. What's going on?""

At that moment, the woman from the Ohio Lottery wanders into the lobby, pale-faced and terrified.

Mr Brent stares at her and doesn't know what to think.

At that moment, there is more commotion and screaming in the press conference room and someone bellows ""Cleveland PD!""

Confusion descends as 13 Cleveland PD officers burst into the lobby, hands on holsters, stern looks on their faces, powerful torsos sucking in air.

""What's going on here?!"" A squat, barrel-bodied officer bellows at the FBI agents.

The 6 foot 6 black agent snaps back at him. ""Federal jurisdiction. This doesn't concern you. This is FBI business and this man here is coming with us.""

Another Cleveland PD officer steps forward, weapon unholstered, fingers near his firearm. ""Now hold on just a sec-""

Another loud commotion is heard in the press conference room and everybody in the lobby turns around in shock.

11 well-built men in smart black suits march in, earpieces in ears.

""Secret Service. Clarke Brent? We're gonna need you to come with us.""

At tha moment, the raised voices of the FBI agents, the Cleveland cops and the Secret Service agents clamour over each other and a loud argument is breaking out.

At that exact point, a small bomb explodes inside the Ohio Lottery Commission building and gunfire erupts, as women in bulletproof vests and long black overcoats start shooting at the cops and Federal agents and the Secret Service personnel. Screams, blood, terror and bullets flying.

Clarke Brent is absolutely terrified. Amidst the gunfire, bodies flying and bullets, he quickly pulls out his blue Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra smartphone and pulls up his ""Rewind app"". He clicks ""Rewind"" and presses ""Play"" at the ""1995"" slot.

Immediately the Cleveland Cops disappear, the FBI agents disappear, the woman from the Ohio Lottery disappears, the Secret Service agents disappear, the female militants disappear, the Ohio Lottery Commission building disappears and Clarke Brent is left standing in an endless white room with no ceiling, no walls and no end in sight.

Suddenly, a small thin African man walks in, white-suited and wearing sunglasses, skin as black as night. 

He begins speaking in perfect English, a posh polished New Yorker drawl.

""Clarke - Are you sure you want to go back to 1995, back to the day you were born?""

Mr Brent stares back at him, bewildered. 
He shakes his sadly. 

""No, Nero Godman. Take me back to before I was born. Take me back to the beginning of he universe.""

Nero Godman, the small African man, frowns back at him.

""Are you sure, Clarke? You do realize that you will not exist? This will be the end for you, for your corporeal form. Clarke Brent, as you are now, will cease to exist.""

Mr Brent blinks. ""Do it. I'm done.""
