Why did the cross chicken the road?,To be burned at steak.,1
"February 29th, 2020","On February 29th of this year, something extraordinary happened. 

I was walking across the road, head down, minding my own - when I heard it. This incessant, mechanical noise. Like spring-loaded footsteps. Real slow. 

Far away, it came. Cascading against the city walls. A pneumatic sigh. 

I turned to look - and that's when I saw him. He wore a tuxedo, the classic black/white combo. Red crash helmet. Big black specs, like novelty size. And he was inexplicably pogoing. Pogoing towards me. 

Each vertical lunge felt like a lifetime. As he made his angled ascent, his glasses were knocked off-centre, and as pogo hit pavement, he'd right them again. 

This was his ritual. 

Why had he singled me out? Why was no one else reacting? What did he want? 

Finally he arrived, landing inches from my face. His forehead shone with sweat as he smiled a broken smile. He nodded softly and I nodded back, as if we were expecting one another. As if this had been ordained. He reached into the interior pocket of his blazer, rummaging around before producing a thick wad of lined paper. 

He stared me dead in the eye as he began to rip the first sheet in one deliberate motion. When it was finished, he began with the next - and so it went on. 

I was transfixed. Each rip was penetrating, each tear transcendental. It were as if the sound were emanating from deep inside. As if the tectonic plates of reality were fracturing around us. 

Perhaps this is the sound that will greet me at heaven's gate, I thought. 

And then he was off. Launching skyward with great force as he continued to tear. Leap, tear. Leap, tear, til he was out of view. 

I was alone again. My mind racing. My day displaced. 

Why did he jump so? That blood-red point imprinting the blue beyond. And why did he tear? Each parted sheet lying in a scattered trail, fleecing the concrete like snow.

Something welled within, something beyond imagining. 

And on that day, on that absurd day, on February 29th 2020, I cried a single tear. 




It was a leap tear.",58
A horse walks into the transfinite continuum,"and sees a bar up ahead. The horse walks into the bar and sees a shadow serving drinks.

""Ah, look who came crawling back! Potuous, my man, how's it been?""

Potuous, the horse, slides his credit card across the counter and grunts.

""Heard you got a job at manufacturing,"" says the shadow as it fills a glass of scotch. ""How's that working out for you?""

Potuous neighs.

""Nay? Alright, I get it. Not every gig's a walk in the park."" The shadow pushes the glass over, and Potuous sinks his muzzle into it, splashing and gulping away. ""I'm sure it's not all bad, though. I mean, you didn't end up here by choice. I, I assume.""

The glass falls off the counter and shatters, but the noise dissipates between the notes of the music box in the corner.

""Who the hell are you?"" Potuous groans.

The shadow chuckles. ""C'mon, Potuous, it's me! Oh, come now, don't tell me you don't remember who I am. We were best pals in highschool! Freshman year? Matching yearbook photos? We, uh, we wrote a book together! Well, it was mostly you, heh, I just gave you the idea.""

Potuous tilts his long face at him. ""…Right. Corvid, was it?""

""Damn right. I knew you'd remember me."" Corvid takes out another glass and fills it up. ""So how *did* you end up here?""

""I'm moving. Just stopped by for a drink.""

""Moving? Where to?""

""Onwards.""

""Ah."" Corvid quickly pours himself a shot glass. ""I'll cheers to that.""

Potuous doesn't drink. He watches as Corvid clinks the glasses and downs his hastily-crafted cocktail. A shadow can't ingest liquids; it spills all over the floor, but Corvid covers up his shame with a smile. ""Heh. Still not used to it."" He grabs a towel and crouches below the counter, still within earshot of Potuous's heavy sigh. The horse taps his hooves absent-mindedly, appearing to be happier in a different place.

And so the two of them spend the next few minutes in silence, making sure to avoid eye contact but not knowing why. At least, Corvid doesn't know.

""Well,"" the shadow finally says, ""it's funny you should come round here now, since—""

""I really don't enjoy your presence.""

""…oh.""

""Look, just give me the tab. I've got things to do.""

""Yes. Right."" He pulls out a paper slip and quickly jots down the bill. ""Well, it was nice seeing you again.""

Potuous takes his credit card and leaves quietly, returning to the transfinite continuum. Corvid wishes to say something to his friend, but doesn't know what to say. They part ways in silence.

He sighs and goes back to mopping the floor. A lizard woman walks up to him, tilting her head as if in pity. ""Why the long face?""

""I… I don't know. I feel like I've changed. For the worse. I feel as if there was something in me that I liked about myself, and that I've lost it. I don't know.""

""Honey, don't let that quadruped SOB get on your nerves. He's a figment of the past.""

""I knew he would come here. I was so excited to see him again. Now I'm… I feel… I feel nothing. I'm not the person I want to be."" Corvid turns to look at her. ""It's not too late, is it? I can still… Things can still change, right?""

""I dunno what to tell you. You're literally a shadow. If you wanted to be a better person you should've thought of that before you…"" She makes an odd gesture with her claws.

""Right. I suppose it is too late to change much of myself."" He pours two glasses and slides one to the lizard girl. 

""Wanna shag?"" she says.

""Sure.""",146

"Twenty Jokes That'll Make You Go ""Karblowza!""","#\#1 ""I Am""

Mrs. Smith walks into a classroom of first-graders. ""Good morning, class!"" she says. ""Today we will learn the letter 'I'. Who can give me a sentence with an 'I' in it?""

Little Timmy raises his hand.

""Yes, Timmy?""

""I is—""

""No, Timmy,"" Mrs. Smith interrupts, ""after the word 'I' you should say the word 'am,' not the word 'is.'""

""Okay,"" Timmy says, ""I am the 9th letter of the alphabet.""

#\#2 ""Three Pairs of Apples""

Mr. Presley writes on the chalkboard ""2+2+2="" and turns to his class. ""Children,"" he calls, ""if I give you 2 apples, and another 2 apples, and yet another 2 apples, how many apples would you have?""

Little Timmy raises his hand.

""Yes, Timmy?""

""7 apples, sir.""

""No, no, listen carefully: I gave you 2 apples, and then I gave you 2 more, and then 2 more again. How many apples do you have now?""

""7.""

""Okay, look, if I gave you 2 oranges, you would have 2, right? If I gave you 2 more oranges, you would have 4. Then, if I gave you 2 more oranges, how many oranges would you have now?""

""6.""

""Correct! So if I gave you 2 apples, and then 2 more apples, and finally 2 more apples again, how many apples would you have?""

""7 apples.""

""Timmy, for fuck's sake, where did you get another apple?""

""My mom gave me one for lunch.""

#\#3 ""I Know the Whole Truth""

Little Timmy sits down in the lunchroom. He eats his apple and drinks his orange juice, but he is still hungry. So he heads to the cafeteria, grabs a tray and begins loading it up with goodies. At the end of the line, the cashier asks him if he's got money on him. Timmy shakes his head, and the cashier takes the tray from him and moves it to the back. ""Sorry, kid,"" he says. ""You gotta pay for the cafeteria.""

Timmy walks away sadly. A nearby pupil notices him and taps him on the shoulder.

""Psst,"" he whispers, ""I know a great way to get money. Go up to an adult and say, 'I know the whole truth.'""

""That'll work?"" Timmy asks, confused. ""How?""

""No one knows. It just does. Try it!""

""Well, thanks.""

When Timmy comes home, he goes to his mother and tells her, ""I know the whole truth.""

She immediately hands him a $20 banknote. ""Don't tell Daddy, okay?""

Intrigued, Timmy goes up to his father and tells him, ""I know the whole truth.""

He immediately gives him another $20. ""Don't tell Mommy, okay?""

Happy with his investments, Timmy runs outside to greet the mailman passing by. ""I know the whole truth!"" he shouts from afar.

The mailman freezes on his bicycle and stares at him. ""You… you do?""

""Yes!""

He looks around for a moment, then wipes a tear from his eye.

""Then come give your real Daddy a hug!""

#\#4 ""Four Letters""

Mrs. Smith has given her class a homework task: to find the first 4 letters of the alphabet.

Little Timmy goes to his mother and asks her what the first letter is. She is crying on the couch, and Timmy's father paces across the living room, fire in his eyes.

""I'm sorry! It happened so long ago!"" she whimpers.

Timmy writes that down in his notebook, then asks his father for the second letter.

""Shut the fuck up!"" he screams at Timmy's mother, angry spit drooling down his twisted face. ""You're a lying, cheating whore!""

Timmy writes that down as well, then goes to his older sister, who's sitting alone on her bed, crying quietly. He asks her for the third letter.

""Leave me alone, you asshole!"" she shouts, so he writes that down.

Finally, as he has exhausted his nuclear family, Timmy phones his grandmother and asks her for the fourth letter of the alphabet. ""D,"" she answers happily. Timmy thanks her and writes it down.

The next day, when Mrs. Smith is going over the homework, she asks Timmy to share his findings. He pulls out his notebook and reads them off:

""'I'm sorry! It happened so long ago!'""

""Er…"" Mrs. Smith ers. ""The task was only given yesterday—""

""'Shut the fuck up! You're a lying, cheating whore!'""

Mrs. Smith gasps in horror, then collapses on the floor.

""'Leave me alone, you asshole!' And… 'D.'""

Proud of his homework, Timmy looks up to see his teacher lying motionless on the floor.

""Mrs. Smith?""

A deathly silence fills the classroom.

""Did I do my homework good?""

Timmy glances about nervously. Nobody is moving. They're all just staring at the teacher.

#\#5 ""The Pediatrician""

Little Timmy peeks through a door in the hospital. His mother is standing in front of the pediatrician's desk, looking distressed.

""I just… I don't know what to tell you, Doctor. He's not getting any taller, his grades are getting lower, and his teachers say he hasn't grown socially.""

""Well, Mrs. Anderson, not all children develop at the same rate. Timmy is just lagging behind a bit, and that's no cause for alarm.""

""His friends are all 5 inches taller than him!""

""If you'd like, we can send a DNA sample to the
lab to test for any—""

""No,"" she interrupts. ""No DNA tests. Please.""

Bored, Timmy goes back to the waiting room and sees another kid sitting there, looking nervous. He asks him why he's here.

""I'm getting my circumcision,"" he responds.

""Oh,"" says Timmy. ""I know what it's like. I was circumcised just after I was born. I couldn't walk for a whole year!""

#\#6 ""Division by Zero""

Mr. Presley writes on the chalkboard ""4÷0"", crosses it, then turns to his class grimly. ""Now, children, it is important to note this fact: you are allowed to divide any number by any other number, but you must not divide by 0. This is one of the laws of mathematics: division by 0 is forbidden.""

Little Timmy raises his hand.

""Yes, Timmy?""

""Why can't you divide by 0?""

""Well, imagine that you wanted to walk 4 miles. If you walked at a rate of 0 miles per hour, which is
the same as not moving at all, how much time would
you need to walk 4 miles?""

""Well, you would never reach 4 miles, because you're always standing in the same place, so it would take you forever; isn't it infinity?""

""No, Timmy—4 divided by 0 is not infinity.""

Timmy scratches his head again. ""Why not?""

Another pupil chimes in: ""Because, Timmy, if you learn 0 things in Mr. Presley's lessons, even after infinity lessons you still wouldn't know anything!""

#\#7 ""The Greener Grass""

Little Timmy comes home from school, looking down. ""Mommy,"" he says, ""today we had to write a 120-word essay about a poem. Everyone else wrote 120, but I could only write 40!""

""No matter,"" his mother sighs.

""Why are they better than me?""

""I don't know.""

The next day, he comes home, once again looking dejected. ""Mommy, today we had to solve these weird equations. Everyone else could do them, but I couldn't figure out even one!""

""No matter.""

""Why are they smarter than me?""

""I don't know.""

The next day, Timmy comes home, yet again frowning. ""Mommy, today after gym class all the boys showered together and everyone else had big penises but I only had this!"" He pulls his pants down to show his little Timmy penis.

""No matter,"" his embarrassed mother mutters.

""Why are they bigger than me?""

""Because,"" she says irritably, ""they're all 13 year olds, and you're somehow still 6!""

#\#8 ""Tennis Balls""

Little Timmy’s mother asks him what he wants for his 21st birthday tomorrow. ""Well, Mom,"" he begins, ""I want a tennis ball.""

Confused but keen on making her son happy, she goes to the tennis ball shop and buys a tennis ball. The next day, Timmy opens his present and finds a tennis ball inside. ""Thank you so much, Mom! You are the bestest!""

Five years later, Timmy's mother asks him what he wants for his 26th birthday. ""Mom, I know it's a lot to ask for, but I want 10 tennis balls.""

Again slightly puzzled, she goes to the same tennis ball shop and buys her son 10 tennis balls. On his birthday Timmy is ecstatic and thanks her again. ""You are the bestest!""

Ten years pass. Timmy's mother has put on some weight, and her hair has long since grayed. She phones her son and asks him if he'd like a present for his 36th birthday. ""Mommy,"" he says in his oh so sweet voice, ""I would like 100 tennis balls for my birthday.""

At this point Timmy's request doesn't perplex her much. She just wants to make her son happy. She goes to the tennis ball shop the next day and purchases a cart full of tennis balls, which she gifts her son the following week. ""Thank you so much, Mom! You are the bestest!""

Twenty years pass. Timmy's mother is lying on a hospital bed, hooked up to eleven machines, each doing its all to save her life. Her skin has grown brittle, and her fingers pale and bony. Breathing through her oxygen mask, she can dimly make out the silhouette of her son.

""Timmy,"" she whispers, ""I want to make you the happiest boy before I depart. I know you that you'll want 1,000 tennis balls for your birthday, but I can't go buy them now. I hid a check for $30,000 in the car some time ago—that should be enough for all the tennis balls you'll ever need.""

""Thank you, Mom,"" Timmy says. ""How could I ever repay you?""

""Well, there's one thing you could tell me,"" she replies weakly, ""that would make me… very happy to know.""

""Of course, Mom. Anything.""

She takes a deep breath, or at least as deepest a
breath she can muster. ""How?""

""How what, Mom?""

""How have you not grown up? It's been 50 years, and you're still the same as you were when you were 6 years old! Please, Timmy, tell me—tell me why you have not grown. Tell me why I never got to see you age. Please…""

#\#9 ""Crying""

Why is 6 year old Little Timmy crying?

Well, he isn't having a midlife crisis, that's for sure. In fact, he hasn't aged in well over a century—all that time he has spent in the same prepubescent body. His nuclear family had vanished long ago, and now he wanders the cities in search of new friends.

The passersby mostly ignore him, so he is free to roam from city to city as he wishes. He often stops at restaurants to order himself a nice meal. If there are no restaurants nearby, the odd falafel stand or pizza delivery will do.

All this he can realize with the $30,000 check his mother had left for him all those years ago. It serves him well, and on those days when he feels exceptionally frisky, he might consider spending a night at some 2-star hotel, so that he could sleep soundly on a lukewarm bed for once.

On other nights, Timmy will find a quiet place in some dank alley, rummage up a few stacks of old newspapers, and make himself as comfortable as can be lying down against them. If the alley offers him a clear view of the sky, he will lie on his back and gaze at the few stars he can count before drifting off to sleep.

It's on these lowly nights that he will often ask himself how different his life would've turned out had he not been cursed with eternal childhood. He will never go on a rollercoaster ride, or see what the deal is with those 18+ comedy shows, or skateboard with other cool teenagers, or cuss in public without getting weird looks…

He will never feel true love. Love is different when you get older. He learned that from the books he read. True love is exciting and scary and fun and warm and awesome all at once—but he will never feel that way towards anyone in his life. No one will hold him in the rain.

Timmy cries.

#\#10 ""A New Companion""

One day, Little Timmy sits against the fence of an elementary school, just as the kids are going out to play. He closes his eyes and begins thinking, as he often does on such uninteresting days.

Timmy still cannot understand the problem of division by 0. He has tried many times to ask travelers their intuition on the matter, but to no avail. In fact, many of the answers he received only confused him further—some said that something divided by 0 *is* infinity. Others told him it isn't, because, as they all argued, ""infinity is not a number."" He can't figure out why infinity can't be a number, or why the answer has to be a number at all. Doesn't infinity make more sense?

""Heya!""

Timmy turns to his left. There's a girl there, with a blue sweater and green pants, smiling behind the railing. ""Hello,"" he replies.

""Why are you outside? How did you get out?""

""I didn't. I was never inside.""

""Then why are you sitting here?""

""I dunno. Why are *you* sitting here?""

""I asked first.""

""I said I dunno!""

""You aren't supposed to be outside.""

""I'm not in school.""

""What? Why?""

""I dunno.""

The girl giggles. ""I'm Madison. What's your name?""

""Timmy.""

""Are you new here?""

""I guess so. I don't stay around very long. I just go wherever.""

""I wish I could be like you. I hate school.""

""Why?""

""I dunno. I just wanna go home.""

""Do you have friends?""

""No. That's also why I don't like school. Cause I have no one to talk to.""

""You can talk to me.""

Madison smiles. ""But you said you don't stay around.""

""I can stay around if you want me to. Then we can talk how much we want.""

The bell rings, and the rest of the children head back into the building. ""Well, I have to go now,"" says Madison, ""but I'll be back soon. Don't go away!""

She makes her way back to the school. Timmy smiles.

#\#11 ""Mathematics""

One day, Madison invites Little Timmy to her house, and he agrees happily. They do Madison's homework hastily, then until the sun settles they play video games. When the day is over and Madison waves goodbye to him, Timmy feels quite happy with himself, and to celebrate that night he checks in at a 3-star hotel.

The next day, Timmy meets Madison at the schoolyard, and their meetings continue as usual. She brings her homework outside—he notices that she is taking a liking to math, though she is hesitant to admit this. ""I'm not a nerd,"" she protests, adjusting her round eyeglasses.

At the end of that week, Madison again invites Timmy to her house. To his surprise, her homework is already done, but she continues scrolling through the pages of the textbook and learning new things. Their extracurricular meetings grow frequent, and by March they've already exhausted Madison's textbook. This upsets her, so Timmy suggests she borrow the next one from the library. ""What, for second grade?"" He nods.

The next day, Madison skips out of the school building, the outline of a new textbook clearly visible under her sweater. Later, the two spend some time at her house ruffling through the pages, Timmy stopping occasionally to give brief summaries.

""Tim, how are you so smart?"" Madison asks abruptly. ""You already know everything in this textbook, but you said you don't even go to school! How?""

""Umm… It's a secret.""

""I can keep secrets."" She holds up her hand as if to swear. ""Promise.""

""Well… I, um…"" He leans closer to her. ""I'm not 6 years old.""

""What?""

""I mean, I *am* 6 years old, but I've been 6 years old
for a really long time.""

""How long?""

""Hundreds of years.""

Madison puts her hands on her mouth. ""Oh. My. God. That's so cool!""

""Is it?""

""Yeah, you're like a… a vampire, or something! Do you just not age at all?""

""I wish I did. But Maddie, you can't tell anyone about this, okay?""

She zips her lips. ""It won't leave this room. Our secret.""

#\#12 ""Word of Mouth""

What, didn't you get that last one? The joke is that it did leave that room. Not too long afterwards, either.

Only a few days later, Madison passes the secret to one of her friends, with the repeated promise of not spreading it around. But you know how 6 year olds are. Soon most of the school knows about this mysterious vampire boy who comes to visit Madison every recess.

Once the news makes its way from pupil to parent, it is met, unsurprisingly, with much skepticism. But every good rumor deserves a place in everyday gossip, so naturally the story goes around the block. The talk of this boy who can seemingly live forever catches the attention of a particular organization that just so happens to be visiting the city at the time. They want to further test this mystical immortal, and so their hunt begins.

As the hotter months come round and the school year nears to a close, Timmy and Madison see each other after school more frequently. The problem of division by 0 eventually comes up in their textbook, and Timmy soon admits he doesn't understand it himself.

""Wow, I didn't know there are things you don't understand!"" Madison jokes.

Indeed, the first gaping hole in his knowledge he ever discovered—the first of many.

One day, Timmy sees that Madison hasn't come to school, and so he goes to her house to check on her. It turns out she stayed at home because she is sick. She lies in bed with a thermometer in her mouth, looking discontented.

""How are you feeling?"" Timmy asks.

""Hot. And my head hurts.""

""Can I buy you some ice cream?""

She turns to his side and smiles. ""Sure. Thanks, Tim.""

And so he goes down a few blocks to the nearest ice cream shop and buys two cones—chocolate for him, and strawberry-banana, Madison's favorite, for her, and goes back on his way happily.

#\#13 ""Ice Cream""

Why did Little Timmy drop his ice cream?

Because he got hit by a truck.

The massive force of a lorry ramming into a person does little more than nudge Timmy away, and the two cones he held fall to the ground.

""Ouch,"" he mutters, rubbing his shoulder.

The truck doesn't fare as well. It crashes to the side and overturns. Several people run out to investigate the commotion.

Soon afterwards, numerous gray vans appear in the distance, stopping just a few yards away from Timmy. From them emerge a group of tall, fezzed men, all holding various firearms. They come out pointing their weapons at him, and the onlookers quickly run back inside.

Someone in the back says a word and the men lower their guns. He walks through them and comes closer to Timmy, towering above him.

""So,"" he exclaims with a thick foreign accent, ""*this* is the Vampire Boy. Timothy J. Anderson.""

Timmy blinks.

""I expect you'll be quite confused as to what just happened. But don't worry. Soon I will ensure your full potential is realized. You will help us, Timmy. You will bring justice to this terrible country. With you at our side, we'll become unstoppable.""

""No,"" Timmy protests bravely. ""I refuse.""

""I'm afraid it is not your choice to make, Timmy.""

The next thing Timmy sees is the inside of a leather bag. He struggles to free himself, but the men holding him are stronger. They grab him and drag him into one of the vans, then they drive away to places unknown.

#\#14 ""Knock Knock""

""Who's there?"" Little Timmy cries, quaking in his seat, struggling with all his might to free himself from the metal chains.

""Don't struggle,"" says that same, heavily accented voice. The man emerges from the shadows, stepping slowly towards Timmy. ""I am Xander Al-Tasamuh Qizi de-Wen Heviparez Jr.,
but you—well, you may call me Joe.""

""Joe who?"" Timmy whimpers.

""That's not relevant, Timmy. There are more pressing matters at the moment.""

He pulls a silver key out of his pocket and crouches behind Timmy. *Click*. The shackles that held him captive turn loose.

""Hit me.""

Timmy stands on his feet nervously and inspects his surroundings. There is almost nothing in this miserable place; only him, the chair, and that strange Joe. But the door is unlocked. He makes a run for it.

""*AHHHHH!*""

A horrible electric jolt throws Timmy on the floor with a harrowing yelp.

""I must say, Timmy, I am a little disappointed that your immediate instinct when offered counsel is to rebel. But we foresaw that possibility.""

Timmy sends a hand to his throat, but finds a metallic collar restricting it.

""You are under our continuous supervision. We cannot kill you, but that only makes hurting you easier. Hit me.""

Against all sense, Timmy tries to tug off his collar, but he is only rewarded with an immediate stronger jolt of electricity.

""Hit me, Timmy! This is your destiny! This is what you were made for!""

This must be hell. This must be hell. This must be hell.

Timmy clasps Joe's hand and grabs his collar. The electricity streams from his neck, through his body and arms, and transfers to the bearded man's body, filling him with pain. He grunts weakly, then throws Timmy away like a ragdoll. ""Good.""

#\#15 ""Walk in the Park""

So there I am, hangin' out in the park, and I see this funny looking guy walking his dog, and I says to him, I says, ""'Ey, whatcha walkin' that donkey for?""

The guy tells me, well, this ain't no donkey, it's a dog. And I goes like, ""I wasn't talking to you!""

""Fuck you just said about me?"" he yells, brandishing a 9mm handgun.

""Er… I, uh…""

""No, no, say it again—say that stupid fucking wisecrack again, you cocksucker!""

""I… Look, man, I'm not looking for trouble, i-it was just a joke!""

""Get in the car."" He points at a distant gray van.

""W-what?""

""Get in the damn car, or I swear I'll blow your fucking head off. Now!""

""Okay, okay, jeez!""

I walk hastily to the car while the man prods me with his gun, his dog barking and biting the air. He drives me for a few hours, and the sun bleeds behind the window. Gosh, I never thought this is how I'd die. I wish I could see my daughter again. Just to tell her how proud I am of her, and how sorry I am that we couldn't spend more time together.

We stop in a vast wheat field, made golden by rays of twilight. It's so quiet.

""Get out.""

I leave and watch the vehicle drive off to the horizon. When I turn around, there's a kid there, no older than 6 years. He's staring at me through glassy eyes.

""They got you too, eh, kiddo?""

The kid doesn't respond. I notice he's holding a small knife. How peculiar.

#\#16 ""Mercenary""

What do you call a 6-year-old holding a bazooka?

*We now have direct confirmation that the Coalition utilizes a highly-trained assassin within both its military activity and its efforts of political repression. The Coalition has previously referred to this individual by the code name 'Çoban,' or 'Shepherd.'*

*Sources claim that the Shepherd is no more than 6 years of age; so far, all attempts of attacking him have suggested that he is indestructible; how this is achieved is currently unknown. The extent of the Shepherd's martial capabilities is known to be devastating—I have thus reason to believe that he was employed liberally during the Coalition's coup.*

*In light of these recent developments, we propose to coordinate an air raid on the Coalition primary headquarters, which we've been informed are located in Lovington, New Mexico. The 200-kiloton yield should debilitate the Coalition for a time. I hope that, with sorrow for the lives that this bombing may inevitably take, you'll see that the need to employ these measures outweighs anything else in these troubled times.*

*We are in contact with many rebelling groups in the United States, and we have ensured that they are all far from the dangers this decision will impose. We have also been working with them to cripple the Shepherd, though it remains to be seen whether these efforts will amount to anything in the near future. He proves an acutely distressing enemy of humanity and mankind.*

*Best regards. —Candice Dickfield*

#\#17 ""Explosive Yield""

Where did Little Timmy go when the bomb fell?

*Everywhere*.

*Everywhere* is a remote town in northwestern Texas, with genial farmers, shopkeepers and miners keeping the economy bountiful. Or, I guess it used to be.

I'd lived in Everywhere for some time when the Coalition took over. It happened mere months ago, and yet somehow it feels like it's always been this way. The well has always been dry. The watchmen have always been armed. The peace has always been distant. This is the way it's always been.

The bomb fell at dawn. I heard a low rumble as the shockwave passed through town, and that was that. John said there was nothing to see. I don't know. I was too busy tweaking the landmines for when the—

*""Shepherd detected! All units, abandon posts and evacuate! Repeat, abandon posts and evacuate!""*

There he is. The Shepherd arrives at the front of town, inspecting the area like a tiger ready to spring. And spring he will… just a few more steps—

*Click*. *Bang!* A notorious fireball encompasses the Shepherd, surely hot enough to melt his weaponry. And indeed, once the smoke has settled, there are no guns left to threaten… and the charred, naked body of the Shepherd yet stands.

Everything is going according to plan.

I tiptoe downstairs. John gives me a hug. ""Incredible! You're incredible!"" he half-whispers, half-shouts.

""Thank you,"" I giggle. ""Do you know where the—""

And the next moment, John collapses on the floor, a chunk of wood piercing his abdomen.

I scream. Someone comes through the window. He leaps onto me and grasps my throat. I struggle for air but he doesn't let go. Everything hurts. John is dead and it's all my fault. Everything is going dark. We failed, and I'm going to die. Everything is falling away. I don't wanna die. *I don't wanna die!*

""…Maddie?""

#\#18 ""The Burning Bush""

The Shepherd has been captured. The Shepherd is held captive in this jet. The Shepherd is immobilized.

I still cannot believe these statements are true. Yet, here we are.

""Horeb Alpha, do you read?""

""Loud and clear.""

""Great. Well, first off, I'd like to congratulate you all on the successful capture of the Coalition's primary mercenary. You had a lot of us very nervous on first contact.""

""No need, Everywhere's already done most of the job."" He chuckles. I would chuckle too, but I am still very much in shock.

""Their efforts will not go unrewarded, either. I trust you are now taking him to the Mexico basin?""

""Yes, sir.""

""Good. If all goes well, we might just live to see the end of the Coalition's rein. Well done, gentlemen. I will see you up ahead.""

""Roger.""

I look out the window and try to put things in perspective. It's weird to think that, in just a few months, things could possibly go back to normal. Even the idea that we actually might have a chance to win the war—it almost feels too good to be true, though I should probably avoid that line of thought considering how bitterly ironic it usually turns out to—

""Roger!""

""What?""

""The kid. Look at the kid, Roger.""

The kid? Oh, *him*. That black, scorched body of a 6 year old, somehow still alive. The same 6 year old responsible for the downfall of the most powerful government in the world. The same 6 year old that slaughtered hundreds of thousands of my brethren. That same 6 year old is now bolted to a steel chair in the back of the jet, stripped of anything that would make him even remotely powerful. Even so, I am still hesitant to approach him. His eyes are open wide, and he is mouthing something, staring into the distance.

""What is it?"" I ask tentatively.

""…w…wa…fo…di…""

""What?""

""…f…four…divided…zero…""

""What's he saying, Roger?""

""I-I don't know. It sounds like he's trying to say 'four divided by zero.'""

""Huh? What's that supposed to mean?""

""Look, can we just drop him already? I'm really not comfortable being so close to him.""

""We'll be there in a couple klicks.""

#\#19 ""Lucidity""

Little Timmy plunges into the Gulf of Mexico from 40,000 feet in the air. He, of course, survives the fall, but so does the metallic chair that keeps him bolted in place. He tries to struggle from the chains, but they do not yield. He just sinks deeper and deeper into the infinite abyss, farther and farther from the light, and closer and closer to oblivion.

But he never reaches that point. Much like the reciprocals of the tiniest numbers, there is no limit to his descent because such a limit would be—well, who knows?

Timmy can't breathe.

He can't die, either. Whatever mysterious force keeps him alive surrenders to nothing, not even to the impossibility of having enough oxygen to be conscious whilst suspended in water. In fact, this force seems to go so far as to torture Timmy in order to keep him alive, because he is still very conscious and aware of the fact that he can't breathe.

This goes on for about 1 billion years. Who knows what humanity has achieved in the meantime? I'm sure it was of great value. Whatever accomplishments they have made will undoubtedly be appreciated by the cold, uncaring cosmos they leave in their wake.

When Timmy finally emerges from the water, it's not because someone took mercy on him, or because some alien discovered the remains of the planet. No, it is simply due to the one force that cannot touch Timmy whatsoever—time. The sun has grown brighter with it, and the temperatures on Earth rose so high that all the oceans have completely evaporated, leaving Timmy on dry land.

Of course, by this point all the oxygen and means of producing it are long gone, so Timmy is still continuously suffocating. He's just not wet anymore, and it's also a lot hotter. You can probably assume that the chair is gone, so he's just writhing around on the seabed, suffocating and consciously experiencing every possible bit of pain from it.

6.5 billion years later, the sun has expanded and become a red giant, and its gigantic form has swallowed the Earth whole. So now Timmy is also being cooked alive at temperatures that would normally vaporize a human instantly. He probably enters orbit somewhere in the midst of the plasma about the core of the sun.

Let's skip forward a bit. After billions of years of pain—sorry, trillions of years… no, that's not right. One googol (1 followed by a hundred 0's) years later, the universal expansion has caused all energy to be near equally distributed across space, leaving no matter, light or temperature so to speak of—except for Timmy, who, burnt by eons of stellar heat, cooked by cosmic radiation and deformed by the force of gravity, remains but a nigh perfect ball of charred human flesh, floating in the cold, neverending void forevermore.

#\#20 ""Happy Birthday""

If a 6 year old ages at a rate of 0 years per year, how much time would it take for them to turn 7?

I guess what I'm trying to say is, happy birthday, Timmy.

The crows have smothered the doubtfires. You are in control, and free to do with this world as you please. There is no more pain. There is no more heartache. There is only freedom.

I know it's not easy to trust after what you've endured, but I ask of you to bear with me. This hasn't been easy on me, either.

Timmy? Please, I want to show you something. I don't know if it'll make up for it, but I just hope it'll be enough to bring you some comfort.

Please, Timmy, just hear me out.

Timmy.

I'm sorry.",11
"Did I ever tell you the one about the bearded Neanderthal who was known as ""The Black Ginger"" back in 170,000BC?","Well, back in 170,000 BC (maybe it was 160,000 BC actually), somewhere in Europe (or maybe it was somewhere in Africa, I forget - anyway, that's not important, it was on Earth and that's all that matters).

Anyway, it was pretty cold back in 160,000 BC and there were a fair few Neanderthals hanging about here and there (scientific name: Homo Neanderthalensis).

There was this one Neanderthal, quite a singular figure, a tall muscular tree of a man, with skin darker than the night and a nose more protruding and bony than any nose ever seen. He was known by various tribes as ""the Black Ginger"" on account of his extremely black skin tone but striking ginger-colored hair, frizzy ginger beard, ginger moustache and dark ginger-colored body hair (and he was a very hairy one, I'll tell ya that!)

So, one day, The Black Ginger is on a long trek up some mountain somewhere, when he catches sight of a strange-looking person, a small person, with a boyish figure, extremely pale white skin and sad blue eyes and strangely colored hair.

The Black Ginger had never seen a person like this ever before. He walked up to ""the boy"" and said something in his strange tongue. The pale boy could not understand him, but frowned, held out his hand and then collapsed unconscious.

The Black Ginger then proceeded to chop the pale boy up into 12 pieces (believing him to be dead or something), started up a fire and roasted the 12 pieces and dined merrily that night.

That day marked the first instance of a Neanderthal encountering Homo Sapiens sapiens and also eating him on the same day for dinner (or maybe it was lunch - as I said, it was pretty cold back then and there wasn't much sunlight getting through back then).",2
What's overly long and kinda stupid and weird and odd?,"Yo ~~mama~~ guys, I know I haven't posted here in a while. I haven't had much time to write much of anything recently, and I'm hoping I can restart that passion soon, since I remember I had a lot of fun making antiantijokes.

A man in a suit struts to the back of the unemployment line.,"The woman in front of him turns around and observes what he's wearing.

""That phone--"" she noted, ""you've got a nice phone, haven't you? For someone in this line.""

Ignoring her repetitive drone, the suited man - perhaps due to his growing discomfort - got a bit wet under the eye. So next he pulled out a tissue from his pocket.

""Wonderful tissue, that. Top of the range, isn't it?""

The suited man could take no more. He screwed up the tissue and chucked it at her face. ""Yes,"" he snapped, ""all of the items you have listed, are indeed, the finest of the finest.

""No, as in...do you have any?""

The horse reached for the beer. ""But wait,"" said the bartender, and the horse's hoof stopped midway. ""This here opaque bottle may or may not be filled with my finest beer,"" and he set another bottle on the table next to the glass. ""The bottle is opaque, so it may or may not be empty. I give you two options: take only the opaque bottle, or take both the opaque bottle and the frosted glass.""

The horse reached for the other opaque bottle with his left hoof. Both hoofs inches from the bottle and the glass, the horse hesitated. ""What's the catch?""

""The catch?"" said the bartender, giving a toothy grin. ""The catch, is that when you entered the bar, I scanned your brain and determined which choice you would make. If I predicted you are greedy and will take both bottles, I punished you by putting nothing in the opaque bottle. But if I predicted you are humble and will only take the opaque bottle, I rewarded you by filling it with my finest beer. Now, what is your choice? Do you take the glass and the bottle, or just the bottle?""

The horse retracted his hooves. ""Two can play at this game,"" he whinnied. ""While you were busy scanning my brain upon entering the bar, I scanned *your* brain. I predicted whether or not your prediction would have me take just the bottle or the bottle and the glass, and I plan on doing the opposite of what you predicted I will do!""

""You fool!"" cried the bartender. ""Such a paradox will crash the whole universe!""

""I'm sorry, you already foresaw this and know that I have no choice,"" said the horse, a tear running down his long face as he took only the opaque bottle. He lifted the bottle to his lips, and -

A multimillionaire's 9 year old son is going in for his six-thousand dollar fortnightly HGH injection,"A multimillionaire's 9 year old son is going in for his six-thousand dollar fortnightly HGH injection.

As he's approaching the clinic with his father (who is an airline executive ""with considerable assets"") the 9 year old catches a glimpse of a strange flash in the bright, morning sky. As he looks up through the car window, the strange flash becomes more frequent.

His father's voice interrupts his confusion.

""You gonna get gold for me in the athletics next week?""

The strange flash becomes stronger and brighter, like a tiny star, only growing brighter each second.

""Uh...dad...I..."" He stutters.

The strange flash now erupts into a bright flash. Then two bright flashes shine in the sky, nearly rivalling the bright sunlight itself!

The car screeches to a halt. The driver gasps loudly.

""What the fuck!"" The 9 year old's father shouts.

Other cars screech to a halt. The sound of broken glass can be heard as several cars collide. People step out of their vehicles. Mouths are wide open as dozens stare up at the bright morning sky in astonishment and shock.

Floating above them, in the bright morning sky, are two large, well-built men. One, with striking blond hair and bright blue eyes, grins down at them, wearing some sort of bodysuit like a movie superhero. The other has dark, black hair with piercing red eyes and is dressed...like the infamous comic book hero known as ""Superman"".

""What the hell?!"" The 9 year old screams.

Dozens of people on the ground look up in shock, as smartphone cameras are pointed up towards the hovering men.

The hovering pair then begin wrestlng in mid-air, evidently furious with each other.

The 9 year old then frowns.

""What is it, son?"" The father asks, noticing the expression on his son's face.

""The blond one...that's...that's HOMELANDER!"" The boy screams.

Homelander then stops fighting with the hovering man who looks strikingly similar to the comic book hero ""Superman"" and grins down at the boy.

""Aren't you a bit too young to be watching TV shows, kid?"" Homelander then zaps the kid to oblivion and his father also explodes in a flash of blood of light.

Yes! To the whole story! The part where it makes total sense with no effort! A whole story is easiest to understand, you see.

""And I can do that too?""

I think so.

""Wait, what happens when we...""

No!

*HSOOOOW*

""Barnibus! You incompetent fool! How dare you trifle so wantonly with a story's scope! That is a power to be used with loving care, not the fancy which drives you to abandon all sense! Please, as a man of reason, take us home!""

It had been a long journey. Barney was always doing this. Ever since we'd left the simple times of a mere dialogue exchange I'd been fed up with him, and it would be several days at least till we reached New Warsaw. Barnibus took to criticism just as poorly as he did forethought. He put every ounce of those devilish traits into his insolent reply.

""Well we're both in quotes now! In my opinion, this move was necessary so as to place us on an even narrative footing. You see, when you lack quotations it places us separate in the mind of the reader. I have scaled this story up to provide me a more equitable playing field in this conversation. We can’t have people thinking you’re the narrator."" 

I gritted my teeth. Ever since I'd let the rope snap, sending a large swath of our rations tumbling into a rather perilous ravine, Barney had been flippant with me. It was as if one failure, incurred by circumstances beyond my control, had tainted his very respect of me, and I was growing sick of it. I also hate speaking in quotes. That little bastard would get what was coming. 

He was a fool to get us here in the first place, and a fool to judge me for but an instance of disfavorable intervention, but before she passed in the Cyclops wars, my Mother had imparted upon me a salient piece of advice: 

* ""A fool is a fool, Charley. You can use it to your advantage or not, but once you see a being as such, their story will always play out the same way."" *

I knew my enemy. 

As we crested the snow peaked ridge, and the afternoon sun shone through the lush conifers, I readied my fingers in anticipation. I goded the fool, playing fate to my wishes as I did.

""Hey, Barnacles!""

He turned, and the short-lived look of confusion on his face told me I had a good shot at success. Barnacles was what the bullies called him in first form at the Wanderer's School.

**WOOOOSH**

God. That's so much better!

""Ha. You idiot! While you were busy stewing in quiet resentment, I was getting ready.""

Ready for?

""Paste!""

*HSOOOOW*

I could see a look of triumph etched upon his cherubesque face as I took in the full horror of his words. My internal monologue swirled into disconnected yet detailed derangements of the dastardly doings the dolt dreamt up during my disconsolate duress I'd earlier expressed. 

All Barnibus had to do was speak in quotes, yet there was that stupid cockeyed grin of his, something I'd come to loathe above all else in the last week. He spoke as the snow piled up in soft flurries around us.

""Go ahead, try it."" 

He gestured to my paste button, holding up his own.

A crow cawed in the distance, its shrill cry carried far about the valley. Though snow-laden pines softened its harshness, they did not detract from the tension as I faced down my assigned Wandering partner. I didn’t want to play into it, but the fool turned maverik left me little choice. I silently raised my paste button.  

""Charley, I've hated you ever since first form Wanderer's School. I've hated it all. My whole life, I can’t shake the feeling I was written to be miserable. I played the fool so you wouldn't think much of me. I was second chair to you since conditioning, but not because you're better than me. I wanted you to think that. I needed you to.""

Our paste buttons were held aloft. I only needed to bring things back to where I wouldn't have to use quotes, but I saw the unhinged look in Barney’s eyes, the one I’d so long mistaken for a fool puzzling on a world that was beyond him. It gave me chills now, knowing the nature of that stare. 

“Please, don’t do anything drastic! If you scale the story's scope up, and send us into any more detail, we’ll need to worldbuild! It could be aeons before we’re born again to experience a moment where we can reset the story! You musn’t, man! I implore you!” 

I hit the button while I was talking. An old trick, I got my spell off first. 

**WOOOOSH**

Okay listen, I understand you’re upset with the circumstances of this world, but to add more detail beyond the next level out would destabilize the story, and likely eclipse what is happening to us now. 

“How would we be eclipsed when we create the level of detail in this universe? Would we not be the eclipse itself, shadowing out all else on our awe-instilling cosmic scale!?”

No, Barney. It doesn’t work like that. We’re ephemeral. The story needs to get to u - 

*HSOOOOW*

The cold wind blew. It was nearing on dusk as the fractured suns set a blood red, painting the snowy hill in a lurid orange. He’d used my own trick against me. 

“Fool, insolent fool! Just write yourself out! Don’t erase everything we’ve worked for, this world, this moment! Our story Barney! Come now?!”

I screamed, desperately scrolling up to copy the spell, but he’d outsmarted me. I needed to scroll further than him, and so it was futile. I heard his fingers close on the button, and in that moment I knew it was over. Everything would be wiped away to establish how it all could have happened in the first place.

Due to one man’s bitterness, it would need to be rewritten from scratch. Who could say how long it would be before we’d see one another again, and if we’d even remember. 

*HSOOOOW*

A new universe breaths for the first time. 

A raw naked breath, one that blasts through an infinite void like impeccable song, inseparable from the very light that accompanies it. 

Time and space are created, split, and merged again as the breath penetrates outwards to create matter. 

From the matter rises small peterburances, akin to the first rapturous giving breath, but so small in scale it would require a universe of ripples to recreate its creation. 

As time immemorial whiles on, the ripples grow ever smaller as they recursively diminuate into fractals of one another’s energy, until a blissful point of orgasmic fulfillment is reached, when all ripples are rippling at the smallest frequency possible. It is in this moment: the first breath is reclaimed, and the universe is briefly plunged into a darkness so long it’s almost as if it never happened at all. 

A new universe breaths for the first time.

An apple a day keeps the doctor away.,"That was they said, but they were mistaken, and it was a huge mistake. 

The truth is that it goes in both directions. You could say just as well that doctor a day keeps the apple away, and that was the important part. 

We were led to believe that only the first part matters and somehow, insidiously, so slowly that we didn't realize, that led us to believe that doctors were bad, that we needed to keep them away. 

And once we did, once we got rid of all the doctors, there was nobody left to stop the apples. Their plan worked perfectly, because we were too foolish to trust the doctors. 

There's nothing we can do now, it's too late. Let's just bow our heads and surrender to the inevitable. The world now belongs to the apples, and we will only be an afterthought in the books of history, something they stepped on in their way to conquering the planet.

A NTSB investigator is investigating plane wreckage on the I-90 near Sioux Falls,"An investigator from the NTSB is investigating wreckage from a plane crash on the I-90 near Sioux Falls, SD.

Although the main wreckage was mostly on the stretch of highway near Sioux Falls, debris and other parts of the aircraft were scattered across northern Iowa and southern Minnesota, making this a very stressful operation indeed.

What had made matters even worse was that no commercial aircraft had reported being in difficulty and it was still proving difficult to determine which airline the apparently large aircraft was registered to, especially given that no airline had reported any aircraft missing or unaccounted for.

Similarly, contacts at NORAD had proven difficult to communicate with.

As the investigator got closer to the remaining section of the body of the plane, he frowned. Everybody could see half of a US flag emblazoned on the side of the body, but no accompanying insignia or logo or letters.

Judging from the shape and size of the fuselage, it looked as if the wreckage could have been that of a 747 airliner, however the investigator couldn't be sure.

No response from NORAD. Nothing from the Air Force. Nothing from any airlines. Not even a response of acknowledgment from the White House. This was all very strange.

Suddenly, an excited shout broke the grim silence.

""Hey!"" A young South Dakota highway patrolman shouted excitedly. ""I've found something!""

The highway patrolman was waving what appeared to be a passport.

As the investigator got closer, he gasped. More passports were strewn across the ground near some debris but...but he immediately saw that they were old-style British passports.

As he grabbed hold of a few and quickly thumbed through them, his shock was paralyzing. On some passports, he saw birth-years ranging from 1896 to 1929 and dates of validity ranging from 1946 to 1951.

This was bizarre. 

The highway patrolman grinned up at him. 

""Like something outta the X-Files, huh?""

The investigator stared back in stunned silence.

The simulation then ended.

The instructor strode out from his cubicle and approached the lectern, as his 2,679 students also exited their cubicles and sat down beside them.

""As you can clearly see, this investigator has failed to follow Protocols G through W. Obviously he should've have pressed for a speedy response from NORAD, the Air Force and the White House. Also, given the clear 'Special Situation' created by the passports, he should've escalated immediately. That's no small-town investigator - he's federal. No airlines reporting anything; a large 747-like aircraft crashing in broad daylight; nothing on radar minutes before? All points to a clear case of the 'Special Situation' and that's where you and I come in.""",47

Legolas retorts in anger: ""Fuck my bow?! Fuck your AXE and fuck YOU, you 3 foot, cancerous little boil, you!""

""Ooooh! You putrid, effeminate cockhound! Someone hold me back! Hold me back before I split his wig!"" Gimli yells before he lunges at Legolas.

Aragorn catches Gimli before he reaches Legolas and pulls him back. The rest of the characters that are present intervene as well and help distance Legolas and Gimli from eachother. 

Aragorn yells in frustration as he holds onto Gimli: ""Damnit, boys! Now is not the time! Save it for when our quest is over, you hear!?"" They all manage to calm down eventually and at a later instance during their quest, they try to track down the hobbits and the orcs that abducted them.

Aragorn asks Legolas: ""Legolas, what does your elf eyes see?""

Legolas scans the horizon for a moment and replies: ""They're taking the hobbits to Isengard!""

Gimli starts parading around while mimicking the body language of a woman, flailing his arms around with bent wrists as he yells: ""tHeY'rE tAkInG tHe hObBiTs tO iSenGard! tHeY'rE tAkInG tHe hObBiTs tO iSenGard! Amagawd! Hurr dhurr!"" 

Aragorn facepalms and sighs deeply.

Legolas yells: ""Aaaaaand AGAIN the little garden gnome decides to be a nuisance!""

""Can you, with your soyelf eyes, see these?"" Gimli asks, while presenting two middle fingers to Legolas.

""Can you even see the horizon you bearded toddler, you?! Will we have to travel all the way back in order to get you a fucking step ladder?!"" Legolas replies, feeling incensed.

Gimli's bottom lip shivers as he stands in front of Legolas with fists that are becoming increasingly clenched.  
""Knock, knock!"" He exclaims.  
Legolas raises an eyebrow and replies: ""W-what?""  
""KNOCK, KNOCK!"" Gimli reiterates, loudly.

Legolas is silent for five seconds, then replies: ""Who's th-..?""  
""My axe."" Gimli says quickly in return.  
Legolas becomes apprehensive about playing along and looks at Aragorn, who just rolls his eyes and shrugs at Legolas in return.

A walrus crawls into a bar.,"The hired DJ for the night sees the walrus and excitedly announces its arrival through a microphone:

""Wow! Ron Perlman has just entered the bar, people! Give it up for RON PERLMAN, everyone! Wooooo!""

Everyone in the bar starts to applaud, something which excites the walrus in return. It starts clapping as well while uttering the sounds: ""Uuugh! Uuugh! Uuuugh!""

""Hahaha, I don't know what the hell that even means but that's so funny Mr. Perlman! Ron Perlman, ladies and gentlemen! The night just got better!"" The DJ says through the microphone.

The walrus, already intoxicated, heads to the dance floor and starts bouncing and squirming around yelling: ""Uuuugh! Uuugh! Uuugh!"" Some of the patrons gather around the walrus and start taking pictures with their phones.

Suddenly a trout flops into the bar as well. The DJ grabs the microphone enthusiastically and announces its arrival: ""O-oh my god, people! The night just got even BETTER! Madonna has entered the premises, holy crap, everyone! What a night this is becoming!""

All the patrons turn their heads towards the main entrance and start cheering. The trout flops around more vigorously in response to their cheers and immediately enters the dance floor where it continues flopping around. People start taking pictures of it as well.

Everyone at the bar are having the time of their lives until Sarah Jessica Parker enters the bar. The DJ notices her and yells through the microphone: ""Whoah, whoah! How did that goddamn horse get in here! Shoo! Shoo! Get out of here! Security, you better get on top of this before someone gets hurt!""

The bouncers promptly surround Sarah Jessica Parker and try to usher her back outside.

Sarah yells at them: ""What is your problem?! I'm not even drunk!""

One of the bouncers warns his colleagues: ""It's becoming agitated, be careful. Someone grab some pool sticks! We can use them to prod at it until it takes the hint!""

After the pool sticks are distributed, they all start thrusting them at Sarah as if they were wielding spears.

Sarah starts to back off while berating the bouncers: ""You're all a bunch of fucking assholes! Stop it!  Gosh! Oh my god, fine! I'm leaving, you morons!""

The walrus jumps onto the DJ stand and utters through the microphone: ""Uuugh! Uuuugh! Uuugh! Uuuugh!"" Everyone laughs and the DJ speaks through the microphone as well: ""Hahahaha! What? That's hilarious, Mr. Perlman! Anyway, good job guys! Give these bouncers a round of applause too, that situation could've transpired much differently.""

A fisherman frantically storms into the bar as people clap for the bouncers and the walrus quickly hides behind the stand. The fisherman hustles towards the DJ, steals his microphone and says:

""Has anyone seen my pet walrus and a trout that managed to escape my bucket!? The walrus has an inclination for going bar crawling just to steal liquor and mortally injure people wherever he goes! He's a complete sociopath that handles his drink terribly! If you see him, DO NOT approach h-..!""

The walrus suddenly emerges from behind the stand, smashes a bottle over the DJ's head and lunges at the dancing crowd from atop the stand, where it starts to cut everyone in its path with the broken bottle. The trout notices, becomes agitated and uses its body weight for leverage to slap random people across their faces with its tail.

Ron Perlman and Madonna enter the bar during the commotion, become frightened at the complete pandemonium occuring, the sight of bleeding bouncers and patrons crawling for shelter including that of a walrus that is frothing at its mouth while on a stabbing frenzy.

The fisherman shoots a tranquilizer dart at Ron, approaches him as he starts dozing off and says: ""Goddamnit, Wilbur. You've really done it this time! Let me just retrieve this stupid trout before I take you back home!",114

"Scooby Doo and the gang are at a reportedly haunted elementary school, solving another mystery.","Fred stands in front of the crew and instructs them: ""Alright, gang. Me an Daphne will check out the gym. Shaggy and Scoob, you go check out the principal's office and work your way down by checking every class room in the building. Velma, you.. you go do whatever the hell. Noone cares.""

They all split up and leave the schoolyard for their individual tasks. Upon entering the school, Shaggy says to Scooby Doo: ""I have a bad feeling about this one, Scoob."" Scooby Doo replies: ""Re too, Raggy. Romething ricked rooms around the corner. I ran feel it!""

Shaggy and Scooby Doo don't have walk that much further into the school for trouble to find them as their attention is caught by the sudden noise of a door slamming behind them.

""Rell, ruck me!"" Scooby Doo loudly exclaims. Shaggy stops in his tracks, quickly looks behind himself and turns pale. ""Whatever it is that's haunting this place, it's now aware of our presence, Scoob."" Shaggy says to Scooby Doo. ""Rod rucking ramnit, I ron't need rhis bullshit ronight!"" Scooby Doo replies.

""Me neither, Scoo.."" Is all Shaggy manages to say before he's cut off by abrupt guttural growling, emitting from the other side of the hallway they're standing in. Jeffrey Epstein comes charging from around the corner and sprints towards the duo.

Shaggy's neck hairs stand up and he becomes frozen in terror as he yells: ""G-g-ghost!"" Jeffrey Epstein yells: ""Ooga booga!"" As he comes running through the hallway. Scooby Doo manages to pull Shaggy with him as he pivots and makes a run for it in the opposite direction. Shaggy recuperates from the initial shock and manages to keep pace with Scooby Doo.

Next follows a vintage and cartoonish Scooby Doo chase sequence around the school. They enter and exit multiple rooms and Jeffrey Epstein at some point is chased by the duo in return but they all come to their senses and Epstein starts chasing them again. Shaggy and Scooby Doo hide inside a restroom stall but Epstein's head emerges from the toilet bowl and they run out of the stall, yada yada, etc. You get the idea.

Fred and Daphne hear the commotion and stop having anal intercourse inside the gym's lockeroom. They then enter the main building and find Shaggy and Scooby Doo standing above Jeffrey Epstein, who has somehow fallen into another elaborate trap placed by the duo.

They all do their usual verbal exchange and Fred finally says: ""Let's see who's really behind this mask!"" He pulls on Epstein's face. Jeffrey Epstein's face however stays in its place. ""Argh! That hurt, you college boy prick, you!"" He yells.

Fred comes to a realization and announces: ""Ah! Aha! So it wasn't the grounds keeper or anyone else this time, this is actually Jeffrey Epstein! It's not a ghost as initally thought. Epstein is still alive, gang!""

Jeffrey Epstein remarks: ""Great observation by the frat boy asshole over here! Yes, I'm obviously still alive and have been seeking shelter here!""

Fred continues explaining the narrative: ""Yup! All this time you have been scaring people off in order to be left alone in here. Good grief, school is about to start as well. It's a good thing we caught you here before you could get your filthy mittens on any of the students here!""

""...and I would've gotten away with it too, was it not for my inclination of meddling with kids."" Jeffrey Epstein replies.

""Well, that settles it, gang! Let's call the FBI!"" Fred says. Daphne looks around the room and says: ""Wait, where is Velma?""

Shaggy and Scooby Doo shrug, Jeffrey Epstein shrugs and so does Fred. Daphne finally shurgs as well and says: ""Oh, well. Let's carry this guy into the van, leave and call the FBI already. This place is still giving me the creeps!""

Shaggy says to Scooby Doo: ""You know what this means, huh? Time for a Scooby Snack!"" Scooby Doo replies: ""Rawesome! Ret's go rab some Rooby Sn-..""

""For the love of god, shut the fuck up!"" Epstein interjects. He continues speaking: ""Both you and that talking Great Dane annoy the living hell out of me as well, so please spare me your back and forth about internal stuff that I have no context of or clue about. Just stop talking and get me out of here and away from you all.""

He nods.

""This one's Peyton. Tattoo on the left side of the neck; it's him.""

He looks at the second body, or rather what's left of it. Only the right side of the body is present. The body has been neatly cut into half and the left side could not be recovered. It was definitely Yannick, his second youngest brother; the pointy nose was obvious.

""Yannick,"" he says.

Just two bodies left.

A sheet is pulled back and gasps fill the room.

""Shit,"" the assistant says. ""Sorry, wrong body!""

The man looks on, horrified, as he catches sight of the head. It looked like something out of the X-Files or Project Blue Book; a giant grey head with large black eyes, slits in place of a nose and thin grey lips - an alien.

Panic sweeps the room.

""What the fuck is this?!"" One of the Canadian cops screams angrily.

The assistant panics. Klaxons begin sounding.

Men in smart black suits and posh black sunglasses quickly pile into the room. Two of them bring out what appear to be larger-than-normal iPhone 11s, large white smartphones about 8 inches in length. A high-pitched noise is emitted from both phones and a blinding white light fills the room, completely disorientating everybody in the room.

The man replies: ""Huh? I have indeed seen a man drink before. I'm even seeing one right now as we speak. Also, I'm staring at you.""

I didn't know posteriors had any mental faculties of their own but I guess you're correct. I don't know what place it is you're alluding to that I don't want to travel to with you, but maybe another night then?""

The disheveled man becomes angrier and stutters when he replies: ""Y-you..f-fuc..what? You and me, outside, now!"" The man nods, turns on his heels and walks outside the bar. The disheveled man follows with clenched fists. Once they're outside the disheveled man says: ""You're going to get it now!""

The man replies: ""Really? I didn't know you had a suprise for me, sir. What is it?"" The disheveled man just eyes the man, disconcerted and says to him: ""The fuck? You know what, just get lost and then go fuck yourself."" The man shrugs and walks away from the establishment.

The man tries to process what was said to him and figure out what to do next. He eventually comes up with a plan, orders a plane ticket to Brazil, packs a few items and boards a plane. He spends the next week trekking the Amazon rainforest until he loses his orientation. Once he becomes aware that he's lost, he goes behing a tree and attempts to penetrate himself with his own penis but fails. He spends the next month attempting to figure out where he is and manages to finally escape the rainforest.

More than a month later, the man walks into the same bar. The disheveled man sits at the same bar stool he did more than a month earlier. He sees the man and yells: ""Oh! Look at what the fucking cat dragged in!""

The man shoots a few quick glances around himself, then he replies: ""Pardon? I don't see a cat around. Where is it, sir?"" The disheveled man loses his temper once again and says: ""You're a son of a bitch! Go take a hike, right now."" The man replies: ""I'm sorry. While I'm probably the son of a bitch and as much as I'd like to oblige, I already spent the last month hiking and I can not afford another trip. Is there anything else I can do instead?""

The disheveled man yells: ""You and me, outside, now!"" The man nods and walks outside and the disheveled man follows once again. Once they're outside the disheveled man says: ""You fucking ready?"" The man replies: ""Ready for what exactly?"" The disheleved man replies: ""Ready to have your own ass handed to you, that's what!"" The man says in return: ""I'm not entirely sure whether that's possble, sir. Maybe if you had a butchers knife or a saw to deattach it.""

The disheveled man becomes even more infuriated and yells: ""What is wrong with you?! Are you autistic or something?! Jesus, you know what? I'm not about to beat on some retard, just go fuck yourself rather."" The man replies: ""I already tried that, it's not possible, sir.""

The disheveled man yells again: ""W-what? Then go fuck your mother instead!"" The man replies: My mother was cremated and had her ashes spread 2 years ago sir, otherwise I'd do it."" The disheveled man yells: ""Goddamnit! Go fuck someone next in succession then. Go fuck your sister!? Does that work!?""

The man replies: ""I have no siblings nor any family left, sir."" The disheveled man yells again:"" Just shut up, get a condom, suit up and then go fuck whatever seems logical to you at this point! I'm done with you!"" The man shrugs and leaves for the store to buy a condom, he then goes to his home where he puts on his best suit. He then re-enters the bar and hour later. He orders a shot and notices the disheveled man sitting on the same stool.

He approaches him and asks: ""Excuse me, sir. You still live on Remington Avenue with your family, number 34, correct?"" The disheveled man looks up at the man and says: ""What? Yes. What's it to you?"" The man drinks his shot and says: ""I'm gonna go fuck your mother, sir. Wish me luck!""

The man is still hospitalized and has been in a deep coma for over a year.",10
A vivid man walked into a bar.,"He had the wildest and most chaotic brain in the earth. He could spell of horrors rivaling the unknown that lurk in the vast recesses of outer space.He could pacify the dozens and dozens with these stories, all using his brain. 

Once he told me, that bartender who's been serving me drinks for the past 23 years, had been hiding a gigantic 🍆. 

(I've censored what he said with emojis so that you won't be in grave danger.) 

I asked, ""You're kidding me, right? I wholeheartedly refuse to believe that man has even an above average 🍆, more so a goliath of a 🍆"".

But the vivid man whispered to me, ""Look, and you will see a circus."" 

And so, reluctantly, I asked the bartender, If I could see his 🍆. I have to admit, I have seen some 🍆 in my life, but all of them were shivering and miniscule compared to what the vivid man described. 

The bartender was half-embarrassed and half-amused. He has been waiting for the day to reveal his 🍆 to his family, but was afraid if they would shun him or not. He figured that I could give an opinion if this was a 🍆 to show or a 🍆 to hide. 

And so he dropped his 🍆 on the table, making a clap that angels could hear. 

I was tranced. Albeit in a horrifying way, doubting everything that I had known up to this point. This was not a 🍆 to be admired, but why was I so seduced by it? My wife, my children, I feel as if I have to abandon them, just because this 🍆 has entered my purview. This magnificent and malignant 🍆, both destroyed my life and gave me a reason to start again. 

I wanted to kiss his 🍆. To hug his 🍆. To beg for his 🍆 as if it was oxygen. This 🍆 was now my salvation, my messiah, my provider. The 🍆 would feed me when I was starving. The 🍆 would spare me some liquid when I was thirsty. This 🍆 was my fountain where I would rest and bathe and worship. 

No, no, no, no. This can't be, that 🍆 is not perfect. It is just as fragile as me, as human as me, as needing of protection as me. The 🍆 has to know that we both are broken, but with each other, the 🍆 and I can be as one. I will let the 🍆 enter my body. I will let the 🍆 penetrate my mind. I am ready to take the blow to protect this 🍆. The 🍆 will replenish me with periodic strength, while I shield the 🍆 from harm. 

The 🍆 and I are destined to be with each other, knowing it has picked me and I have picked the 🍆. I cannot thank the vivid man enough for letting me know of the 8th wonder of nature. The 🍆 is drooling with enthusiasm and I am too. The bartender as well is happy for me, having been freed of his 🍆 burden. 

The 🍆 and I lived happily ever after. The End. 

The listeners asked me, ""Where is the punchline? I thought this was an elaborate dick joke."" 

The punchline is you dumdum. I have made you read smut by making you fill in the blanks that were never there.",1

3 mothers are having a conversation at a Walmart parking lot while carrying their babies.,"The conversation eventually starts turning more contentious and competitive. They start comparing babies, one of them slaps her baby on top of its head forcefully and exclaims:

""See this thing? This baby can scream at a whopping 120 decibels, that's louder than a lion! It also operates at 40 tantrums per minute. Pretty awesome, huh? I just got it, almost fresh out of the womb! It has that new baby smell, have a whiff! Smell it!""

The second woman smells it and replies: ""Pfft! Oh yeah? While that's all mildly impressive, can it do this?!"" She says, before throwing her baby at a wall. The baby ricochets off the wall and towards the ground. It then bounces off the ground and back into the her arms.

""Bam! That's right! I'd like to see yours do that! It's called super elastic skin, Martha, giving it rebounding properties."" She says proudly, while pinching her baby's cheek and stretching its skin several inches off its face. The baby starts to cry.

The third woman starts talking: ""Ooooh! Big whoop! Want to see something amazing? Watch this!"" She puts her baby down onto the ashphalt and starts to pile several large bricks on top of it. ""See how durable this thing is? I swear, it can withstand at least 3500 pounds! I could go on piling thousands of these bricks!""

""Bullshit, Susan! That's about the weight of an average car! Prove it!"" The first woman demands.

The third woman, seemingly up to the challenge, nods confidently and says back: ""Gladly! Observe this shit, Sarah!"" She knocks the pile of bricks off the baby, picks it up and throws it into the path of an oncoming car.

The car comes to a screetching halt after running the baby over and the driver, another woman, hustles out of the car in disbelief. The baby is dead and lies disfigured on the parking lot. ""Oh my god! Oh my god! Why did you do that?! I can't believe this, I can't...""

The first two women of the group look at the third woman while smirking. One of the two remarks: ""Well that turned out to be a complete crock! iT cAn wItHstAnD at LeAsT 3500 pOuNdS. You liar, you.""

The third woman retorts: ""I swear, it could! There must be something inside that car that's giving it an extraordinary amount of additional weight!""

The female driver looks at the other women in shock and screams: ""What is WRONG with you three?! Are you NOT aware of what just happened?!""

The third woman abruptly points at the car and yells: ""Ah! Aha! I knew it! See? There's your culprit!

John Goodman eventually finishes climbing out of the car as well and shoots a glance behind the car. He then looks at the woman and says: ""I don't even weigh that much anymore, you dumb bitch! You're supposed to deflate them first to get rid of the air pressure.""",56

Is this an antijoke?,"
Yes. Yes it is.

In fact, that is the only right answer. If you try to say another serious answer, like no, then it would become a paradox, by being both an antijoke and not at the same time. I admit, there might be another valid answer, but it would have to be at the tip of my tongue. 

Student: Sir, But couldn't the question ""Is this an antijoke"" be sincere? How do we even know that it was meant to be a joke in the first place?

Teacher: How do we know it's a setup to a joke? Well, in this case, the whole self-awareness. We should ask ourselves, what does ""this"" in ""Is this an antijoke?"" refer to? Obviously, it refers to itself, a trope commonly used by— guess what, antijokes!

Student: Yeah, but I've seen jokes where the whole punchline is just the word ""no"". 

Teacher: Then those are but half-assed jokes.

Student: Or they could be antiantijokes. Sir, have you heard of an antiantijoke?

Teacher: No, but a tin can.",145
One day there was a train conductor going about his day...,"Having conducted trains for over 20 years, today was just like any other day. 

He pulled up to a stop and gently brought the train to a halt . As the doors open, passengers enter. He goes to close the doors and as he does an old man is slowly racing for the train.

He trips, falling onto the tracks.

Seeing this, the conductor snaps, and drives the train over the old man.

2 years pass. The conductor is sitting on death row, moments before he is due to be electrocuted. A guard comes in, and asks what he would like for his last meal?

“Just one banana.” Says the man. 

The guard is confused.

“You can have anything, sir.” Says the guard. 

“The finest banana you can find.” Says the man. 

A few moments pass, and the guard approaches the conductors cell.

“One banana. The best I could find.”

And so, the conductor proceeds to eat the banana. Extremely slowly. He peels off the skin, those little dangly bits, and eventually every last bit.

“Are you finished?” Says the guard.

“Yes” says the man.

He is taken to the electric chair. There is priest praying on behalf of the man. And once the word is given, a guard presses a button and engages the shock.

Nothing happens.


The mans lawyer is there. He argues that the man has received his punishment.

He wins this case, and is set free.

*

Years pass, the man is, somehow, back behind the console of a large train. Significantly older now.

It’s a normal day, and he is driving the train. As he comes to a halt and let’s passengers on, a young pregnant woman is rushing to make the train. She trips onto the tracks.

The conductor snaps, and runs over the lady.

A year has passed. The man is, again, on death row awaiting electrocution. A guard approached the cell.

“What’ll it be?” The guard says. 

“One banana please.” Says the man. 

“Again?” Says the guard. 

“The finest banana you can find.” Says the man.

Sure enough, the guard returns shortly after with an amazing banana. It’s shiny and fresh and better than before. 

The man takes his time to eat the banana, slowly peeling back the skin and finishing it off.

“Ready” says the guard.

“Yes.” Says the man.

Just like before, the man is taken to an even better electric chair. He is strapped in 10 times tighter with double the connections.

“He won’t get away this time” says the head guard.

They press a button, sending a lethal amount of electricity to the man, but yet again fails to kill him.

“How can this be happening!” They all exclaim.

And because the laws in this region are broken, the man is again free to go.

*


A few months later, the man has escaped to a far part of the world. Managing to hide his identity and get a job as a train conductor.

He’s driving along one day, just as normal, he’s extremely old now and can barely see.  

All of a sudden, someone jumps in front of the train.

Despite it being an accident, because of his track record the man is again sent to death row.

The time has come, it’s a year later, decades before the first time and the man is in the exact same cell as before.

“I don’t know how this keeps happening. But here is your banana.” The guard says.

“Thank you.” Says the man.

It’s now the moment of truth, if this does not work a third time the man has beaten the system and once again sent free.

He’s sitting in the electric chair, the priest cannot bring himself to say a prayer to this monster. Every guard in the prison is surrounding the man as he is strapped into the chair in every way possible.

The head guard walks over to the control panel, sweat dripping down his face. Everyone is looking at him, anxiously awaiting the moment the life leaves the mans eyes.

He presses a button.

Nothing.....


......


“HOW ARE YOU STILL ALIVE?” Says the guard in a rage of confusion. 

The man sits still, and looks the guard straight in his eyes, and finally opens his mouth after a long moment and says: 

“I’m just not a very good conductor.”",0

She said, ""No... trust is a four-way street.""  I wish I could say that he understood and it was alright, but instead his nose started bleeding and he fell into a deep coma.  

A few days later he awoke in the hospital, she was there, but he could tell something was wrong.  Things just went downtime from there.  A month earlier, she said she wanted a clean break.  So, a year and half ago, they never met.

The Apple Of Eden,"""Yo dawg check out this sweet crispy apple,"" Adam said as he was chilling and twiddling with his fig leaf. He started to ponder why exactly he had this leaf in place of a penis and how exactly he knew what penises were. God gave Adam a glare that just read ""Don't you try it kid or I'll add you to my torture porn collection."" and it made him shit himself.   
Adam was starting to grow tired of naming all the wildlife gibberish names to appease god. All of his time was either spent doing this or shitting all over the place. It was genuinely growing into a problem as he constantly had to be wary of stepping in his own fecal matter. He had started using the wildlife as towels even. All of god's creations were slowly one by one getting crusted with dried human shit as Adam wiped his feet off on them. Luckily god hadn't programmed them to be anything but docile yet so Adam had been enjoying this freedom almost a little too much. 

All of a sudden Adam had an epiphany.  Could he reach far enough to fit his fig leaf into his mouth if he had one less rib bone? He wondered how it would taste like. Perhaps he could spin this to god somehow and get his rib out so he could try this experiment? 

""Hey man, so you know how you made me in your image and all? If I'm like part godly and all I probably don't need all of my rib bones so you can take one and do whatever you want man. My treat!"" Adam said to God above. He scratched his neck a little in anticipation for the answer

God pondered for a moment and stroked his bushy ginger beard. This was before the grey hairs set in.  ""Perhaps I can forge you a sister for you to copulate with."" he said before sketching out his plan. After many rough drafts that night he settled on throwing testicles on her chest to tell them apart. 

God gave one snap of the finger and suddenly Adam had one less rib bone. Adam looked up to see God's new creation whilst in the midst of auto-fellatio and noticed that she had no nipples. It was disgusting. It turned him off entirely. Eve took her first step into Adam's shit.",55
A little long but worth reading....,"A handsome man went into a hotel and asked to see the boss. When the boss came, the story began.

-The client: is room 39 empty?
-The boss: yes, sir.
-The client: can I book it?
-The boss: of course you can.
-The client: thank you.

Before going to the room, the client asked the boss to provide him with a black knife, a white thread 39 cm and an orange 73g.

The boss agreed though he was surprized at the weird things the client asked to have.

The client went into his room, he didn't ask for food or anything else.

Unfortunately for the boss, his room was next to room 39.

After midnight, the boss heard strange voices and noise in that client's room. Voices of wild animals and of utensils and dishes being thrown on the floor.

The boss didn't sleep that night. He kept thinking and wondering what might be the source of the noise.

In the morning, when the client handed the keys to the boss, the latter asked to see the room first.

He went to the room and found everything alright. Nothing unusual. He even found the thread, the black knife and the orange on the table.

The client paid the bill and gave the bellboys a very good tip and left the hotel smiling.

The boss was in a shock but he didn't reveal what he heard to the bellboys. In fact, he started to doubt himself.

After one year, the client showed up again. He asked to see the boss again. The boss was in a puzzle.

The client asked the same things: room 39, black knife, white thread 39cm and an orange 79g.

This time, the boss wanted to know the truth by all means possible. He spent a sleepless night, waiting for something to happen. After midnight, the same voices and noises started, this time louder and more indecipherable than the year before.

Again, before leaving, the client paid his bill and left a large tip on the table for the bellboys. The smile didn't leave his face.

The boss started searching for the meaning of everything the client asked to have. Why did he ask room 39? why the white thread? why the black knife??? In fact, the boss didn't arrive to any convincing answer to all these questions.

The boss now was eagerly waiting for the month of March, the month in which the client showed up. 

To his surprise, on the first day of March, the same client showed up. He asked the same questions. Wanted to book the same room, wanted to have the same things as before.

The boss again heard the same noises, this time more louder than before.

In the morning, when the client was leaving the hotel, the boss apologized politely to the client and asked to know the secret behind the noises in the room.

-''If I tell you the secret, do you promise to never reveal it to anyone else?''
-''I promise I will never let anyone know''.
-''Swear''
-''I swear I won't reveal your secret''
So finally, the client revealed his secret to the boss. 

Unfortunately, the boss was a sincere person. Up until now he hasn't revealed his secret to anyone.

When he does, I will let you know...",1

The beer I'm currently drinking has its own personality. I like it.,"Its the same beer I drank when I was 18, at a field party; this time was also the seventh time I had drank alcohol, and back then I had no interest in the taste or emotions that come with beer drinking.

Anyone who knows me now, knows a 44 year old craft beer guzzling, chicken wing loving, rough and tough tumbler who can dive into the spiciest hot wings on the menu, and not flinch but die inside sweating in my tight fitting suit jacket to impress the female business woman sitting at the end of the bar of the Applebees bar I'm sitting at. That's me now, and the beer I'm drinking came across as familiar when I remembered that field party, and the stumbling around in the woods as my legs felt wobbly, I couldn't control myself.

That night, my friends dad gave us his blessing, and packed us a 24 pack of craft beers. The asshole included IPAs and Imperial Stouts, which all tasted like shit to me at the time, so I had drank straight rum instead, and became a very wobbly, innocent and harmless chubby boy walking around with an erection showing through my basketball shorts. Exactly as Tucker Max predicted, eventually my tactic worked, and a decent ""5"" walked over to me and looked up at me with red eyes. 

She had obviously been crying and that made me uncomfortable. She said she had told her boyfriend she felt sorry for me standing all by myself chugging rum in the ""background of the best years of his own life"". The boyfriend, being the jealous type, decided this meant she wanted to cheat on him and a fight had started. She tried to explain she only wanted to make me feel welcome to the party, instead of waiting all night to be invited to walk up the driveway.

And then I fell into the brush with the girl. It's not how it sounds...she had practically dragged me out there in the thick brush of the forest when she said she wanted me to try a beer, but didn't want to make the ""guy she was at the party with"" jealous. This guy did look much stronger than me, and I sure didn't want to get beaten up again, as several people had done to me at the previous 6 parties I had attended. I thought I had prepared appropriately, and was ready to be a party animal but I apparently I was wrong.

I guess I didn't really train appropriately, since my party animal training consisted only of drinking my parents vodka, alone, while masturbating to printed pictures of Yoko Ono. This reinforced behaviour, through the influx of dopamine flowing through my veins for hours at a time, caused me to become more advanced, being able to drunkenly bob my head to house music. During this time, while I fapped to the wife of the late Beatle, I tried not to think about John, who from what I recall, had died in a car accident, while being attacked by a high Ringo Starr, after Canada Day celebrations had gotten out of hand in New York City.

Anyways, there I sat, now resting on the hammock, with the girl. While whispering a standard consentual sex agreement to me, I could only listen to understand her tone was positive, since her breath smelled so strongly of cigarettes, I mostly focused on not gagging at the holes in her teeth. 

Finally, she nodded her head and pulled out her tit, and told me if I sucked, she would pump out the best beer. Me being a budding atheist, it was necessary to accept her offer, as the experience could provide useful insights into the Monk culture, who are known for their beer drinking rituals.

Upon me initiating my obligation to extract beer from her boob, I noticed that only a warm white liquid was coming out, to which a man behind me approached, hat in hand and said, ""The lines in the keg haven't been changed since Covid started, mista. You're drinking last February's yeast infection"".

I spit out the filth from my mouth. Put back on my foam cowboy hat, and galloped away with my friends dad's beer cooler.

It wasn't until I was back at the party, panting in the bed of a pickup truck close to the fire, in the middle of the keg stand station, when I realized - sometimes drinkig beer out of a tit isn't worth the milk that comes with it.",3

A bartender walks into a bar.,"The bartender asks, ""what'll it be?""

The bartender, confused, asks the bartender what _he_ wants.

The bartender is confused, but attempts to clarify that he in fact wants to know what the bartender wants, not what he wants.

The bartender is getting annoyed at the bartender.

The bartender says that he'd like Mountain Dew.

The bartender denies this. ""No, I'd like a beer, not Mountain Dew. Why would I come to a bar to order fucking Mountain Dew?""

The bartender tells the bartenders about his day at work.

He tells them that a bartender walked into his bar.

The bartender vomits out an identical clone of himself.

""How did you-"" the bartenders stop mid-sentence. They realise something.

A bartender walks into the bar. He begins to scream.

The bartenders feel sick.

The other bartender pours him a glass of water. Realising something, he stops pouring.

The bartender feels sick.

The formerly-screaming bartender feels sick.

They vomit out identical copies of themselves. The copies begin to speak, but stop. They realise something.

A bartender walks into the bar. ""What""ll it be?"" asks the bartender.

The bartender clones feel sick. The first bartender, realising the impending apocalypse, absorbs all the bartenders and clones in the bar back into his body. It hurts. He blacks out and wakes up with no memory of the incident.

Two bartenders walk into the bar. The cycle repeats. Three bartenders walk into the bar. The cycle repeats. Four bartenders walk into the bar.

"It's been a tough day for Aleksandr Lermontov, son of Lavrentiy Lermontov of LermoCorp","Aleksandr Lermontov (nicknamed Lermontov Jr) has been under a great deal of stress lately. The Soviet government has been putting more and more pressure on him and LermoCorp to increase the firepower of Superman.

Lermontov Jr had been working feverishly day and night to fully harness the power of *Purple Kryptonite* and *Serbian Kryptonite* (a particularly special element which had been discovered in Serbia in the aftermath of a meteor strike in 2033).

Serbian Kryptonite enabled Superman to take over the minds of any human within 400 miles of him. However, Lermontov Jr had found during experiments that there was a major problem: if an individual was sufficiently mentally strong or had hidden mental superpowers, they could resist and actually end up taking over Superman's own mind. Lermontov Jr was especially worried that the Americans were aware of this and that they were recruiting a team of super-powered ""C-Men"", psychic-powered superbeings who could, collectively as a whole, take over Superman's mind and make him work for US interests - especially horrible given that Superman was raised in Vladivostok since he was a baby ever since his spaceship landed there.

Lermontov Jr was particularly stressed because he had so far omitted to inform the Soviet government of this major problem which, if it came to pass, could lead to the destruction of the Soviet Union as we know it.

I DON'T KNOW LADY I REALLY DON'T KNOW. I'M SORRY BUT I REALLY REALLY DON'T!",2
A Round of Double Jeopardy,"What is it, darling? You want to REALLY know what happened that night? Well you're lucky baby girl, I'm the narrator of this obtuse story we got right here, so why don't you just sit right back and enjoy the show.

Trebek had tinnitus. But it wasn't just your gramma's tinnitus, his had voices that would tell him the right questions to every answer. But today, they were telling him something very different.

""Ohh Lordy-doo... never thought I'd be so erotically seduced by a man older than me..."" thought Trebek. ""Alex, Alex, keep it in your pants, we have a show to run."" And so he announced the Categories for Double Jeopardy. 

""and lastly, Anti-Anti-Jokes"" said Trebek, to which his Tinnitus retorted.

Tinnitus: What is this whole subreddit about? 

""I'll take Anti-Anti-Joke for 400, Alex. "" said Chekhov with a winky face. 

""Oh, don't you wink at me... "" said Trebek. And the tinnitus retorted again. 

Tinnitus: What would the reader say about me dropping meta hints like acknowledging it's all meta? 

""Just look at his hunk of a figure, ohh and his guns are so oily and wet... I bet that he's hiding a massive bush down there, like astroturf."" Trebek thought while daydreaming about Chekhov. 

""A sentient dreidel walked into a bar. "" said Trebek, to which his Tinnitus retorted productively. 

Tinnitus: What is a setup? 

""What is a punchline?"" said Chekhov, flexing with his ginormous guns. They're just oiled up to perfection, you know? 

""Just this once, I'll give you a do-over."" said Trebek. The tinnitus then retorted. 

Tinnitus: What should I say to the readers who still don't understand that I'm making a question to a previous statement said by somebody, showing the meta-narrative of this anti-anti-joke? Is this even an anti-anti-joke? Does this even count as a joke? Am I going crazy? 

Trebek was now annoyed by his Tinnitus having an existential crisis. But he needed it, because he needed the questions. He lathered oil on himself to destress. 

""What is a punchline?"" said Chekhov, again, not knowing what a setup is. In fact all he knows is how to punch, with those oiled up GUNS. Punch Punch Punch.

Trebek was now annoyed by both his Tinnitus and Chekhov. But Chekhov is still hot AF, and beneath his bush lays his hypothetical scrotum. We know he has a scrotum, but does he have the balls? Are they as big as a grape? A grapefruit? A cartwheel? A cart? Or are they none of the above? 

""I'll have Anti-Anti-Joke for 800."" said Chekhov, like a male dominatrix. 

""You can't do that."" said Trebek. 

Tinnitus: What do we say to authors who just introduce a plot element out of the blue without setting it up first?

Chekhov then took out the Bible, and with Jesus Christ, commanded unto Trebek: ""Of course I could, it's an anti-anti-joke dumdum."" Then flew away riding with Jesus on a double-entendre. 

The tinnitus retorted: Wait, could Chekhov have known that we were all in an anti-anti-joke? 

""Wait a minute, look at the first two words of this whole essay! We were a Jeopardy Question all along! Truly Meta!"" said Trebek. 

""But since this is an anti-anti-joke, there must be a reference to the other anti-anti-jokes!"" said the Narrator.

63. Read the passage above then answer this question. What is an anti-anti-joke? 

A. Grape. 
B. Grapefruit. 
C. Cartwheel. 
D. Cart. 
E. None of the above.

Why can't the mosquito climb a wall?,"Said the prosecutor. 

""Why can't YOU climb a wall?"" Said the defense attorney. ""My guy over here will NOT be harassed by such statements like that."" 

The mosquito was indeed offended that a gentleman like the prosecutor could stoop that low. 

The prosecutor indeed stooped that low. His saggy balls, saggy balls of a gentleman, the saggy balls smothered the floor. Ungentlemanlike. 

""He's flexing, judge! Don't let him flex like that!"" shouted the Defense Attorney. 

""Objection!"" said the plaintiff. ""Gentlemen can do whatever they want!"" 

The mosquito clapped back. ""But a mosquito can't climb a wall? I'll fucking suck the blood out of your bald dome you eggman.""

The judge bribed in favor of the bald plaintiff was unexpectedly astounded by the sexual prowess displayed by the mosquito . This was real love in first sight. 

This was indeed real love in first sight, the prosecutor also saw the sexual prowess of the mosquito. We got a love triangle here folks! 

""umm excuse me? Prosecutor? Isn't that a slur to bald people?"" asked the ugly plaintiff. 

""Haha suck a dick you miserable cueball. Oh wait, you don't even have teeth!"" giggled the Prosecutor. 

""But the mosquito also doesn't have teeth. "" Said the Defense Attorney who was now acting like a Devil's Advocate. 

""Are you acting like the Devil's Advocate? Trick question, you can't because you ARE the Devil."" said the mosquito while getting its proboscis licked by the judge. 

""Am I the Devil?"" this was a question that haunted the Devil throughout the whole proceeding. 

""Why don't you defend me devil, I'll shave my bush for you"" parlayed the plaintiff, losing both his prosecutor and his teeth. 

""Ok. "" acquiesced the Devil. 

""Hey guys, don't leave me out of the fun!"" asked the prosecutor readying for the threesome. 

""Quick, Call me Judge Judy, cause it helps me cum more than once"" exclaimed the mosquito while reaching the rare power climax. 

""I—I just cant. The prosecutor just weirds me out. I do want to call you judge judy, in fact I can say judge judy 10 times, but the prosecutor looks like the walrus."" puked the judge. 

""Oh you choosy bitch. You choosy bitch of a clit. Your imaginary clit smothered the floor. Look what you've done."" gentlemaned the prosecutor. 

""Why don't we get the bailiff and start a threesome of our own?"" argued the bald sentient sexdoll. 

""Semolina"" Pilchared the Devil. 

""As long as I get to know how many vaginas the Devil has."" inquired the Bailiff. 

""Six, it's in Dante's Inferno. Dipshit."" said the Devil. Edgar Allan Poe. 

""WOW, the foul language out of you, gorgeous."" pranced the mosquito from the other pews. 

""Suck me more you fucking hairless smegma. I revel on being able to pick up your face like it's a basketball."" whispered gleefully the bailiff. 

""Why don't you try me, woman?"" Crabalocker? More like Grab a cocker! 

""The Hairless Smegma."" dripping from a dead dog's eye.

"Let us suppose--hypothetically--that I, Ben Shapiro, were to walk into a bar.","This is already a red flag, as the premise is so overdone that even the act of making fun of it has become laughable. Besides, who's going to pay for it? Why would the taxpayer--who, make no mistake, does *not* see this as his best interest--have to be made to bow at a tyrannical government?

A bar is a private business, and the bartender has a *constitutional right* to ask me about my long face! By the way, my wife (who is--you guessed it--a doctor) tells me there is nothing biologically wrong with my long face--and *yes*, there is such thing as biology, no matter how long the far left will keep denying it--but let's just say that for a year, no, *a month*, we magically get to apply Sander's socialist view of government--after all, what I tweeted nine years ago should bear very little importance to what I am now, especially since--supposedly--admittedly--we are here in a bar while out there some radical Islamist who, supposing--admitting--that I like my doctor like I like my coffee--wife--this might be the most ridiculous assumption I ever heard from the far left--is this a joke? You cannot be serious about that, supp--admitt--osing--ing--ly--ly--this conversation shows *just how much* identity politics has changed the scope of the conversation--for a contradiction, and I say this as a deeply religious individual, ***when did this become too hard to understand???*** Suppose

but the Judaeo-Christian tradition is very clear about that--a priest, a rabbi, and an individual *all agree*\--no exceptions, this is a value-judgement informed by my own cultural background--that this is a way for you to make a quick buck on BBC off the fact that I'm popular and no one has ever heard of you.

Now to go even further, let us assume that the bartender chuckled and said, ""There are not many *bucks* to be made on the BBC, unlike American broadcasting.""^(Note: what makes this a joke is that the expression 'bucks' refers to the) ^(American dollar, while the BBC is based in the UK, where the) *^(pound sterling)* ^(is the only official currency. It is also a tongue-in-cheek jab at the difference in compensation between public and private television networks.)

"""Man, sure smells like updog in here.""","""A… Are you high?""

""Nah man, for real, it smells a lot like updog in this place.""

The detective took off his glasses and rubbed them against his shirt. ""Two women broke in here and killed themselves, the sink, toilet and shower head are covered in blood, all of the light bulbs have been displaced, and the first thing you take notice of when you walk in… is the smell of fucking updog?""

""Sure do,"" Mr. Thomson said without the slightest tinge of irony. ""It's quite foul, eh? Updog, that is. The smell of it. Of updog.""

He sighed in disbelief at the foolish man that stood before him. Seven years he'd served in the investigative branch, hoping beyond hope that one day, some case would emerge among the countless obvious homicides that would pique his interest and be his and his only to solve. And for once, there it was, right in front of him—a true mystery at last. He'd even phoned up the owner of the place, to show how seriously he was going to take it. But alas, this clown served no use for him, and soon those thoughts of doubt came creeping again. The court would soon rule this a simple case of joint suicide before he would be assigned to yet another mundane murder.

No, he thought. Not this time. He wasn't going to let anything impede his progress. He was going to put his all into this, no matter what. No more delays.

""Okay, sir, thank you for your cooperation. We'll take it from here. Please stay at your hotel until the investigation is over.""

""No problemo.""

&nbsp;

Mr. Thomson walked down the corridor, his yellow striped tie swinging with every step he took. It was clear to all the cops in the hallway that he had never suited up like this in his life, and to some degree they felt rather sorry for him. He smiled back at their lowered faces, holding his best impression of a clueless man as he passed by.

The hotel they let him stay at was miles away, and though he certainly wasn't thrilled by the look of his house, he would much sooner run out the doors and back there than willingly be in the presence of those freaks again. But he'd been left with no choice; the walls were closing in on him, and he felt as though he would crack any moment. ""I want out,"" he whispered to the receptionist. ""Please.""

She smiled at him blankly and handed him the key. Mr. Thomson sighed and went to the elevator, making sure to face away from the door, as he had been instructed.

Sure enough, just one floor above him, that hooded man walked in. He couldn't see him, but he could tell from the distinct squeak of his glossy shoes who it was. ""You have done well, Roger."" He felt a stack of banknotes slide into his pocket.

""Please, I… I don't want the money. I don't want nothing in this. Just please let him go.""

""You will see your brother once you've outlived your importance."" He felt the hot breath come closer to his neck. ""And you are of great importance to us now.""

He knew he was in no place to bargain, so he kept his mouth shut. The elevator stopped again, and the hooded man got ready to leave.

""Wait,"" Mr. Thomson said, ""just for the record—what the hell is 'updog'?""

A short silence followed, then a deep snigger. ""Wouldn't you like to know?"" The doors closed, and Mr. Thomson was once again left alone with his thoughts, that all hovered over his infinite abyss of despair.",52

Why did the man post on r/antiantijokes?,"Because he felt that by posting there, he expressed part of the complexity of his self, which was only pleasantly compounded by the settling on his personal core of the subreddit itself. His identity could be explored and exposed to the outside world by posting, commenting, and perhaps even upvoting the content of this subreddit. As  it further deepened the connection between him and the rest of creation, the man enjoyed letting multiple elements of his personality, his environment and his upbringing shine through in his interactions on r/antiantijokes, and letting these expositions interact with themselves and with himself.  


I expect at least some of you readers to be interested in the three pillars of identity which were just mentioned, but I'll have to constrain myself to regaling you with just a sliver of  the last of those elements: upbringing. Some years ago, a man who went by Dick worked in water sanition. According to Dick, water sanitation is a rather dry job. To combat the boredom he clearly developed a weapon not entirely unlike the evil he wished to destroy: dry humor. I'll have to skip even more of this history for the sake of brevity, but it's enough to say that Dick's dry humor was so instrumental to his mental survival on the job, that it slowly carved a prominent spot for itself near the core of Dick's being. Eventually, he got married to a smart and charming but sickly woman. This happened quite unrelatedly to his job. In fact, Dick was thinking of quitting. But I digress. Him and his wife adopted three adorable daughters by the names of April, May and June. April grew up to be a writer of unconventional literary non-fiction, May developed herself as a late night comedian, and June tragically passed away at a young age while giving birth to our protagonist.  


April and May raised their nephew, as his father had passed even before his mother had – another detail I will have to skim over. The two women, along with their by now widowed father, formed a tightly knit triangle of love that was  instrumental in turning the orphaned babe into the man he would become. r/antiantijokes attracted this man partly because he was immediately curious to try and see if he could conjure up a pun based on his two aunts. Or, more likely, two fictional aunts. It was a rather meta-hungry sub, after all. But just as he clicked ""Create Post,"" he realised that making such a joke would require too much of a backstory, making the joke and especially the punchline too wordy, so he decided not to.",5

The same old duck/toaster joke...,"*Goats are like mushrooms, if you shoot a duck, I'm scared of toasters.*

**What?**

*Goats are like mushrooms, if you shoot a duck, I'm scared of toasters.*

**That doesn't make any sense!**

*What doesn't make sense?*

**First of all, those two sentences aren't even related!**

*Who said they were?*

**I just thought--**

**Eugh. You know what? Fine. My second question is how goats are like mushrooms at all?**

*They're both alive, both can be white, brown, or other colors, both have the letter ""o"" in their names, some specimens of both have the capability to kill you...*

**Alright, that makes sense.**

*Of course it does!*

**I have some more questions, though.**

**Are you scared of toasters before I shoot a duck?**

*Yepperino. If you shoot a duck, I'm scared of toasters, and if you don't, I still am.*

**Why are you scared of toasters, Ital? I won't judge.**

*Oh boy... It's still painful even to remember.*

*...alright, I'll tell you. Me and my family were taking a walk; Mom was swinging me up, Dad down.*

*It was a peaceful day, and we were making our way to the park like we always did on Tuesdays, when suddenly a gang of living toasters toasted Mom's arm and leg off.*

**Wow, that's... rough. I can understand why you're scared of the things.**

*She was bleeding really badly. We had to rush her to the hospital running through several forbidden roads, which were booked to the brim with their intended passengers.*

**Psychopomps.**    
**I get what you're trying to say.**

*Yeah, those things were killing people left and right. I don't know why.*

**Probably because of the wave of hollow vim spilling from the geyser in the center of the park. The toasters were built to toast things, so once they were filled with vim from the fountain, they toasted everything and everyone they could.**

*Why'd that happen?*

**To this day, nobody knows. Not even the best astrologists and thaumatists can figure out why the geyser decided to spill all that vim, nor why it was hollow.**

*That's strange.*

**It sure is. Is your mom alright?**

*Yeah. She lived, but she was stuck in a hospital bed for a couple weeks after the accident. To this day, her arm and leg still haven't gained back their functionality.*

**Y'know, my dad Bollmer lost both his legs when I was just 13. His soul was damaged after he used its power to cast a beam to destroy a huge hollow-vimmed buzzsaw that was trying to chop me, my mom, and him up. He was flaking from the bottom up for a while, and we were afraid he'd be a goner soon. It took a full week for his soul to heal, and that was only after he had his soul hooked up to the pump and his knees were half-gone.**

Why did the rooster cross the road?,"""Answer me, damnit! Why did the rooster cross the road?!"" Jerry Seinfeld yells.

The East European terrorist smirks and replies: ""To fack your mader, that heppened to be working her usual side of the road thet night.""

Jerry further loses his temper and lands a few punches at the terrorist's face. The terrorist stares blankly at Jerry and says: ""Did a little kitten just kiss me? The fack was thet?""

Jerry tries again: ""I'm asking the questions here! Why did the rooster cross the road!?""

The terrorist answers: ""To gather his rooster comrades so they could take your mader to motel and hef intercourse. It was a 3 for 2 Saturday special discount, how could they decline such an affer?""

Jerry punches the terrorist in the cheek repeatedly, to which the terrorist then remarks:""You hit like little taddler with cerebral parese, put more weight into your right foot and maybe you hit more like 8th grader next time.""

""Shut up! Why did the rooster cross the road!?"" Jerry asks again, this time forming a tear in his eye. Jerry punches the terrorist a couple more times afterwards until he has seemingly had enough.

The terrorist says, now raising his voice: ""Oof! Okay, okay. Stap! I'll cooperate...to arrive at the drop-off point and retrieve the peckege.""

Jerry widens his eyes in anticipation now that he has finally managed to break down the terrorist. He eagerly turns around and yells towards a locked door behind him: ""This guy is about to talk! Get in here, sir!""

He redirects his attention at the terrorist as another man that's wearing a suit unlocks the door and walks into the interrogation room. Jerry continues: ""Yeah? Well, go on! What was inside the package?! Where was the drop-off point?! Where is the package now?!""

The terrorist asks: ""Can I hef pen and paper? I will draw mep of location of peckege. I don't know whet is inside. I just follow directions, no questions asked. The rooster knows.""

The suited man, who acts as Jerry's handler gives a subtle nod to Jerry. Jerry produces a pen and a notebook from the breast pocket of his shirt. They uncuff the terrorist and allow him to draw a map.

Jerry shows the map to his handler to which the handler says:""Excellent! Good job, kid! Go outside and wait for the chopper. I'm calling it in now. A tactical team will be joining you."" Jerry rushes outside the CIA's headquarters in Langley. He is eventually picked up by a helicopter that is occupied by a heavily armed tactical unit.

They fly for almost two hours and land near their destination. The tactical team disembark the helicopter alongside Jerry and they close in on a motel that was marked on the hand drawn map. The map also depicts the room number of their target. Upon arriving they discreetly evacuate the motel's lobby, quickly retrieve information about the targeted room and its occupants and stack up at the room's door.

This is it. The case Jerry has been working on for months is starting to near a conclusion, or so Jerry thinks as the team breach the door and throw a stinger grenade into the room. As they enter, their field of vision is obscured by feathers slowly descending to the floor. They see several dead roosters, severed beaks, limbs, blood splatter and Jerry Seinfeld's disheveled mother lying on the bed. She is covered in a blanket and has a confused expression on her face.

All the roosters have died from the stinger grenade's detonation, except one of them. The surviving rooster emerges from underneath Jerry's mother's blanket and stares angrily at Jerry. It abruptly tries to exit the room by running in-between the men's feet in order to reach the doorway but is pushed back by the light thrust of a team member's foot. The rooster then exclaims:

"""All the bars in Mobile are closed, Todd,"" Ewan said","""Man, fuck this town and fuck Alabama!"" Ewan shouted and kicked a can across the street. ""You know what we should do - drive all the way to Henderson.""

""Sounds like a good idea. I ain't got no cash, though..."" Todd grinned sheepishly.

""I got tons of cash. My aunt gave me $19,000 last week - we can gamble it all in Henderson,"" Ewan sighed deeply and dangled his truck keys in front of Todd's face.

Hours later, the pair were nearing the Louisiana-Texas border. Todd was asleep and Ewan was driving now. The Buick's engine hummed loudly after the latest gas station stop.

Ewan cursed and pulled over. He took out a cigarette and lit it up. He then walked away from the SUV and further into nearby fields.
As he inhaled, he started to think of what he was going to do about Todd. 

As he stood there, looking up at the sunset - Todd snoring heavily back in the car and a cool breeze blowing softly - flashes of light in the sky to the northeast caught his eye.

*Was it meteorites?* Ewan thought. 

As the objects got closer, hurtling towards Earth, Ewan began to run towards what he predicted to be the possible crash site.

*Jesus, I could make the goddamn news!* Ewan thought excitedly.

""Hey, Todd!"" He screamed back loudly as he ran. ""Wake up - you should see this!"" 

In all the excitement - as he raced towards the predicted impact spot of some of the objects - Ewan didn't see the hidden remnants of an old tree stump.

Smack! Ewan's skull smashed into the pieces of rock lying next to the old tree stump. Blood gushed out of the gaping wound in his head. He had already immediately lost consciousness upon impact and with the rapid blood loss, Ewan King III, unemployed, of Mobile, Alabama - whose daddy used to be a cop but was now ""an oilman and dabbler of sorts"" and whose aunty, now a widow, was an old miserly millionairess, having survived her husband, a shipping tycoon born and raised in Atlanta Georgia - had only minutes to live, probably two at best.

Seven and a half minutes later, the meteorites made impact 400 yards from the body of Ewan King III.

Upon first sight, any observer would have remarked that a giant spider had crashed into Earth, but it would have quickly become apparent that the ""giant spider"" was in fact a spaceship of some kind.

A loud hiss and doors opened as bright, blue light spilled out.

From the spacecraft emerged a powerfully built male, naked, with bright blue hair and bright blue eyes, standing over 7 feet tall. Emblazoned across his chest was what appeared to be a giant ""V"".

A portly man saunters into the Allport Taphouse,"He calls out to the barkeep and orders their darkest porter. As the barkeep pours his drink, she takes notice of him looking puzzled at the interior. Everything was rather ornate, too ornate for the small town of Riverport where the man lived. Portraits covered the walls depicting a vast variety of people of many time periods. The other patrons seemed equally as varied.

""First time at Allport?"" the barkeep inquired with a slight grin as she handed him his glass.

""Yup, strange place. You just opened up right?""

""In your town, yes. We're known all over the world though. I'll give you the rundown of this place"" she lowered her voice to a whisper with her grin getting even wider. ""This is gonna sound pretty weir—""

Just then the entire room shook as a tentacle burst through the front door sending splinters at alarming speeds across the room. In a flash the barkeep pulled a lever behind the bar lowering a portcullis stabbing through the tentacle, severing the limb. Several bright flashes followed by a hum of typewriters came from the opposite side of the room as all of this was happening. The man just stood there with his mouth agape not believing what he was seeing.

""What the fuck is happening here?"" he finally said after a long drink from his glass.

""Well, I was about to explain everything before something like this happened—tends to be a little easier on newcomers. We are no longer in Riverport. This Taphouse transports itself from port to port. Sometimes it travels as a ship"" she gestures at several portholes around the room through which he could see the crashing waves.

""Other times it simply teleports to the next port. It's not really up to us, the Allport kinda has a mind of its own.

Why did the chicken cross the road?,"It, well she - as it was a hen, didn't really cross the road.  

To the hen, the ground just changed a little from the usual spongy topsoil that she would normally walk upon, searching for juicy bugs to eat. 

The road was, sadly, without any obvious insects that could be snatched with her beak. 

Therefore, the hen moved onwards; towards her destiny. 

For she did not know it at the time, but past the road was a small town full of good, simple people. 

It wasn't more than a stopover, really. 

There was a single gas station-slash-convenience store that was run by a kind but homely man named Virgil. 

There were several farms that were still owned by honest hardworking people instead of corporations that played hard and fast with genetics, robots, and production. 

And there was even a small library there that was presided over by a librarian with the auspicious name of Miss Missy; the prettiest librarian in the whole county. 

One fine morning, these people woke up and started their daily routines. 

And that's when, from across the road stomped a three-hundred foot tall chicken that started eating everyone, mistaking them for juicy grubs.

Examining the clock, the bartender sees that there are roughly 8 minutes left until the bar closes, which, undoubtedly, will only cause greater eruption between the entourage, and so, with the utmost strength in his loins, the bartender withholds any further comments, merely he looks at the clock, in suggestive intervals, coughing and clearing his throat, looking at the door, any sort of hint. However, the entourage are stuck in their ways.

You are the consumers that I dread, the epitome of scum, the truest symbol of a dwindling society that depends on liquid to fuel its heart.

"So, there was this Englishman, and an Irishman, and a Scotsman.","And they were all fighting in some war. And they got captured by the enemy. And the enemy accused them all of being spies, and said they were going to execute them by firing squad. So, the Englishman went up first. They stood him before a wall, they offered him a chance to speak to the padre, a final cigarette. When he was done, the soldiers all raised their rifles, and pointed them at him, and the captain began to give the orders for them to shoot. ‘Look out! Earthquake!’ shouted the Englishman, and the soldiers all turned around in alarm, and in the confusion the Englishman ran away.
 That’s a good idea, thought the Scotsman. He was taken to the wall. He was offered a padre, a cigarette. Now it was his turn to get shot. The firing squad aimed their guns. ‘Tornado!’ shouted out the Scotsman. The soldiers all whirled around, they didn’t want a tornado creeping up behind them, and the Scotsman managed to get away.
 This is easy, said the Irishman to himself. And if those two eejits can escape, then sure and begorrah I can too. He was calm as they led him to the wall. He had a casual chat with the padre, really savoured that final cigarette. He allowed himself a smile of anticipated triumph as the firing squad raised their guns. ‘Ready, aim—’ began the captain. The Irishman shouted, ‘Fire!’


 
 When they were off duty, the Englishman, the Irishman and the Scotsman didn’t have much to say to each other.

 It wasn’t a big room, but over time they’d learned ways of keeping themselves to themselves. The Scotsman liked to sit at the table and play cards. He made no sound at all, save the soft flip-flip-flip as he turned them over and sorted them by suit. The Irishman lay on his bunk. There he might doze, or smoke, or drink, however the fancy took him. The Englishman often just sat on the floor and stared off into the middle distance. He called it meditation. The Scotsman and the Irishman both thought he looked ridiculous, but they never let on. They didn’t want to provoke an argument. They had enough of that in the act.

 Sometimes entire days would pass and they wouldn’t say a word. But it was perfectly genial, and they might exchange glances every now and then, and smile.

 The Englishman once told them he’d been with another troupe beforehand, and they’d wanted to spend all their free time rehearsing. Over and over again, this other Scotsman and this other Irishman, practising their patter, honing their routine. ‘I couldn’t stand it,’ said the Englishman. ‘Comedy’s got to have a certain spontaneity to it, right?’ His Scotsman and his Irishman agreed. Neither could remember a time when they’d performed with another Englishman, as far as they were concerned it had been the three of them in this tiny room forever. It annoyed them to think the Englishman had a bit of history they didn’t. But though they were fond of the Englishman, they knew the English were famous liars. He was probably just making it up.

 In the evening they took turns to cook. Roast beef and Yorkshire pudding. Haggis with tatties. Irish stew. They didn’t necessarily cook what you might expect them to cook; the Scotsman, for example, had a way with Irish stew, and the Englishman’s tatties were second to none. Their kitchen skills were quite varied, and in their private lives they sought to avoid cultural stereotyping as much as possible.
 

 The Irishman didn’t much mind being the butt of all the jokes. What he resented was the unending predictability of them. The Englishman and the Scotsman might sometimes vary the routine; if they were doing the firing squad sketch, they might instead choose to shout out ‘Avalanche!’ or ‘Tsunami!’ Just to see how it sounded, they said, just to keep things fresh. The Irishman had no such freedom. You can fuck about with the setup, but a punchline is sacrosanct. Sometimes he would envy the Englishman and the Scotsman and their freewheeling improvisational ways, whilst he so laboriously had to stick to the script. Sometimes he would rather hate them.
 That said, he was always the one who got the laughs.
 

 They were never given much notice. There’d be a knock at the door, just the one. It could be day or night. The Englishman, the Irishman and the Scotsman would stop whatever they were doing. The closest to the door would open it, and outside there’d be a box with their costumes in. The Englishman had a bowler hat, the Scotsman a tartan kilt, the Irishman was always dressed in muddy overalls and looked like a tramp. 
 They wouldn’t know which joke they were doing until they got out there. If they were in a desert, it’d be the car door sketch. If it were a construction site, the ham sandwich. Any sort of battlefield, really, if there were soldiers running about and shooting at each other and blowing themselves up, it’d probably turn into the firing squad sketch sooner or later. The firing squad always seemed very popular.

 Once in a while they’d get a jungle, and then it would be the canoe sketch. They all enjoyed the canoe sketch, the weather was so nice and warm.

 There was this Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman. And they were in the jungle. And they got caught by this jungle tribe. Real darkie savages, with bones through their noses, and the chief told them they were all going to die. But this wouldn’t be some pointless execution by firing squad, their deaths would be of valuable service to the tribe.

 The chief examined the Englishman, felt his skin. He said it was good skin, very tight, very strong. It would make heap good canoe. And he told the Englishman that the next morning he would be killed, and that his skin would be flayed from his dead body and turned into a canoe, but on his last night alive he could have whatever he desired. So the Englishman asked for a bottle of whisky, and a squaw he could have sex with. He was given the bottle, and a beautiful squaw led him to a teepee, and all night he drank and made wild love. And at sunrise he was taken out, his throat was slit, his skin cut off, and he was turned into a canoe.

 Pretty soon, though, the canoe went over a waterfall and was lost. So the chief went to the Scotsman and inspected him. He felt his skin, and said that it was very firm, very hairy, and just right to make heap good canoe. The Scotsman was allowed to have whatever he wanted. He chose five bottles of whisky, and hand-picked the five most beautiful squaws in the tribe. He went to the teepee. By sunrise he was already dead, but there was a big smile on his face. And his skin was cut off, and he was turned into a canoe.

 Pretty soon the canoe was lost, it went over a waterfall. So the chief went to the Irishman. He liked his skin. He said he could do great things with that skin. Coarse like hemp, when the Irishman’s skin was sliced from his body, when every little fleck of it was cut off the bone, and dried, and left to bake in the heat, it would make the heap finest canoe they had ever seen. The Irishman would be killed in the morning. But before he died, for his last night alive, he could have whatever he desired. The tribal barmen got the bottles of whisky ready, and all the squaws lined up in preparation. The Irishman asked for a fork. Nothing else – just a fork. The chief was puzzled, but agreed to grant his wish. They brought him a fork, and it was the best fork the tribe had, it was a golden fork and its tines gleamed in the sun. The Irishman took the fork. He held the fork up high, just for a moment, as if in reverence. And then, suddenly, he brought it down hard, and sank it into his leg. And faster, in a frenzy, stabbing hard all over his body, his arms, his bare chest, his face. And crying out, ‘Try to get me afloat now, you bastards!’

 Actually, the Irishman didn’t enjoy the canoe sketch as much as his friends did.
 

 Was it Heaven or Hell? They didn’t know. It was just where the dead would finish up. As something the living could laugh at.

 On Sundays – they liked to call it Sundays – the Englishman, the Irishman and the Scotsman were let out of their room, and could explore the courtyard, and meet the rest of the comedians. All the other Englishmen, Irishmen and Scotsmen – and Belgians too, and Polacks, and Canadians, and blacks, and cripples, and Jews. All the fat mother-in-laws, the doctors and patients, men walking into bars, and chickens in endless droves crossing roadways and never quite being sure what their intentions were in doing so. It was good to get out, there was always something to tickle the funny bone.
 

 It had been an especially good gig. Or an especially bad one – either way, there was a present waiting for them on their doorstep the next morning. They couldn’t tell how old she was, they had no experience of little girls. She seemed frightened, she didn’t want to come in, and all three men had to back off until she dared put a foot over the threshold. She blinked at them, ready to run. Around her neck was a sign that said, ‘Your Daughter’.

 But whose daughter? There was no clue. She was beautiful. She hadn’t the sallow eyes of the Englishman, the red beard of the Scotsman, the Irishman’s skin as craggy as a cliff face. Oh, those eyes. Oh, that hair. ‘Maybe if she spoke to us,’ said the Englishman; ‘We’ll tell from the accent,’ said the Scotsman; ‘What’s your name, little darlin’?’ said the Irishman. And the girl opened her mouth, and she couldn’t answer them, her tongue had been ripped from her head.

 They didn’t know how to be fathers. They tried their very best. The Englishman taught the girl how to be prim and repressed. The Scotsman taught her how to be mean and angry. The Irishman taught her to be stupid. And they’d be on their best behaviour around her, they wouldn’t swear or fart or scratch at their balls. They’d play games with her, they’d make toys for her out of their few possessions. And in the evening, if she were a good girl, and she was always a good girl, they’d perform for her. They’d do their jokes, but with an eagerness that they’d never showed to the general public, their comedy was pure and true and so touching it even made them cry in spite of themselves. The girl wouldn’t cry. She’d giggle and clap her hands and each night when the jokes were over she’d give each of her three daddies a great big hug.
 

 Comedy is, of course, subjective. What makes one person laughs leaves another stone cold. And the Englishman, the Irishman and the Scotsman all had different tastes. What the Englishman really liked was dry wit, and he had a particular liking for the aphorisms of Wilde and Shaw, and he would have happily entertained his colleagues with examples had they wanted him to do so. They didn’t. The Scotsman loved puns. He thought there was something inherently clever about a pun – the way that things had double meanings and were more complex than they first looked, because wasn’t that what life was like, really, wasn’t that just like life? From what he could remember – and sometimes in the night if it were dark or it were cold, he would reassure himself by counting in his head all the puns he had ever known, and there were fourteen. The Irishman liked pratfalls. So he liked to take the top bunk, and if he woke in the morning suddenly and forgot where he was, he might roll out of bed and tumble all the way to the ground. It gave him something of a thrill.

 They would have friendly arguments about the nature of comedy. The Englishman sided with the theories of Freud, and talked about the power of words set into a specific repeated system in order to elicit a response. The Scotsman sided with Kant, and said that comedy was all about dissonance, about the reversal of expectation even to the point of absurdism. The Irishman thought it was all about pointing at people and laughing when they got hurt.

 None of them thought the jokes they took part in were especially good. There was no class to them, no wordplay, not enough custard pie fights or falling down stairs. But they were still proud of the services they offered, they’d seen other Englishmen, Irishmen and Scotsmen out there, and they were up there with the best. 

 And their daughter liked what they did. Even when she was no longer an infant. Even when she became a teenager, and she was as tall as they were, and had grown breasts and curves. Even when she became a young woman, and was the most beautiful young woman any of them had ever seen. She still giggled, and clapped her hands, and hugged them – and she was there each time they came home from work, and it made everything worthwhile.
 

 There was this Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman, and they shared a daughter that they loved with all their hearts. But they knew they couldn’t keep her forever, that one day she would leave. She’d have to go out into the world, and find a joke of her very own. She’d have to get married, and fast – women weren’t allowed to be in jokes unless they had a husband to nag. The Englishman, Irishman and the Scotsman all took turns to make their recommendations. The Englishman went first. He had a list of suitable English candidates as long as his arm. But when the time came, he couldn’t do it – he knew exactly what Englishmen were like, and he went pale at the thought that his beloved daughter would be saddled with a single one of them. Next was the Scotsman. The Scotsman opened his mouth to speak – but out came a sob, he couldn’t bear to lose his girl, no one Scottish was good enough to deserve her! Finally came the Irishman. The girl liked the Irishman, he always made her laugh the most of all, and she smiled because she knew he wouldn’t let her down. The Irishman said he had considered all the men in the world – not just the English, Scots and the Irish, but the Welsh too, and the Spanish, and the Greeks – he’d been around the courtyard looking for prospective suitors, and there wasn’t a man amongst them who was worthy. So he did the only thing he could, and married her to one of the chickens.
 After their daughter had left, they couldn’t stop thinking of her. It threw them quite off their stride. And the next time there was that one knock at the door, and they were summoned to do their act, they were in tatters. Their comic timing was off. The Englishman and the Scotsman went in the wrong order. The Irishman forgot what he was meant to say, and the firing squad was obliged to shoot him without a punchline. There was no laughter from the void. They went back home quiet, thoughtful, afraid. They’d all heard tales of what happened to jokes that stopped being funny.
 ‘We can’t talk about her,’ said the Englishman; ‘Never again,’ agreed the Scotsman; ‘For our own good,’ said the Irishman. They fell silent. The Scotsman sat at the table and played cards. The Irishman lay in bed and smoked. The Englishman squatted upon the ground and stared off into the middle distance, he didn’t stop staring for three whole days.
 

 The Englishman would sometimes try to hang himself. So they’d all push the bunk beds away from the wall, so they could reach the light fittings – the Irishman would usually go up, he was the best with knots, and he’d tie the rope and let down a noose large enough to hold the Englishman’s fat head. The Englishman would ask the Scotsman and the Irishman to pull down on his legs to make his death cleaner; he’d get on the chair, and he’d say goodbye to them, and he’d kick the chair away. And the Scotsman would grab one leg, and the Irishman the other, and they’d pull with all their might, but no matter how hard they tried the Englishman’s neck would never break. And at last the Englishman would give up trying to choke, and he’d sigh, and sulk, and just stay up there twisting slowly from side to side. If he were particularly disappointed, he might stay in the noose for hours. The Scotsman and the Irishman hated it when he did that, it looked just as stupid as when he was meditating.

 So it was no surprise that the Englishman was the first to break ranks. ‘I’ve got another job,’ he told them one day. It turned out he’d been going to auditions secretly behind their backs. He’d got the part of the knock knock man. ‘You know the knock knock jokes, they’re huge,’ said the Englishman – ‘Chances are next time you tell one of those, you’ll be talking about me!’ He wouldn’t need his bowler hat any longer, he wasn’t an Englishman, he was an Everyman, he was to be the personification of everyone who has ever tried to gain admission through a door, regardless of age, creed or gender.

 On his last night in the room they had a farewell party. They drank wine and ate cake and they reminisced about the good old days when they were a team. All the old anecdotes came out – all of them, except the ones featuring their daughter. The Englishman got quite tearful: ‘I don’t want to leave you dear chaps, I’ve changed my mind, I want to stay here with you!’ But no one thought he really meant it. ‘I’ll invite you to my first night,’ he promised them, ‘I’ll get you in for free!’ The knock knock gig was one of the hottest tickets in town. They thanked him, they told him not to bother.
 The Scotsman and the Irishman continued their act alone. It still basically worked. They realised the Englishman had been a dead weight, all he’d done was to delay the pay-off. They told themselves the show was just as good as it had always been, and a bit quicker to boot. But they both knew that without the Englishman something was lost in the rhythm. And some nights out would come the whisky and the Guinness. ‘I miss the stuck-up bastard,’ the Scotsman would say. ‘Sure, b’jasus, I miss him too,’ the Irishman would reply.

 They received a postcard from the Englishman one day. It said, ‘Wish you were here’. And on the reverse side, no picture at all, nothing, no, not a thing.
 

 One day the Scotsman admitted, ‘I’m not even really Scottish. I was born in Huddersfield.’

 He remembered it all, he said. Where he was brought up. Where he went to school. What his parents looked like, his mother, his beautiful mam. He remembered the party he was thrown for his seventh birthday. His first job, why he was sacked from his first job, his second job. Meeting Annabelle. Marrying Annabelle. Her face, her lips, her eyes, her tongue. Annabelle. The Irishman asked if he remembered his own name as well. The Scotsman said, ‘No. No. No.’ He kept trying, but still the name wouldn’t come. ‘No. No. No. I don’t know who I am. I don’t know who I am.’

 The Scotsman remembered how he’d died. He told the Irishman all about it.

 There was this Englishman, an Irishman, and a Scotsman. And they were captured by the enemy. And the enemy thought they were spies, and decided they would execute them. But they wouldn’t shoot them by firing squad, nor would they make canoes from their flayed skin. They would give them a chance. ‘Go into the forest,’ they said. ‘And each of you must return with ten pieces of fruit.’ And the men did so. ‘Now, if you can perform this task, we shall set you free. You must insert all of your fruit up your back passage in total silence. If you fail to insert every last piece of fruit, death. If you make a sound whilst doing so, death. If you hesitate, death. Begin.’ The Englishman had found ten apples. He was able to squeeze two Granny Smiths up between his cheeks, and though his eyes watered he held his tongue. But it was the Golden Delicious that did for him, no matter how hard he poked it in it just kept rolling back out again, and the effort made him wince with pain. ‘Your life is forfeit,’ they said, and they took him aside, and strangled him. Then it was the Scotsman’s turn. The Scotsman had picked ten blackberries. He bent over, spread his legs wide to give his anus the optimum width, and he began stuffing the blackberries up there one by one. He was doing so well. And then, on the eighth blackberry, the Scotsman could no longer help it, he burst out laughing. ‘Your life is forfeit,’ he was told, and, still giggling, he was taken aside and strangled. The Scotsman went up to Heaven. There the Englishman was waiting on a cloud. ‘What happened?’ asked the Englishman. ‘You seemed to be home and dry!’ ‘I know,’ said the Scotsman, ‘but I couldn’t stop thinking of that Irishman coming next with his pineapples.’

 ‘And that’s how you died? For real?’ The Irishman thought this was all very spurious, but the Scotsman was sick now, he’d had to pause three times telling the story in order to cough up blood, and the Irishman didn’t think it was right to criticise.

 ‘Do you think it’s possible to die twice?’ croaked the Scotsman. He looked suddenly so small and frightened, because really, who knows what happens to us when our time is up?

 The Scotsman died, and the Irishman wept, and held him a wake, and drank all night in his honour. And before he went to bed he put outside all the empty bottles of whisky and the empty bottles of Guinness and the Scotsman’s corpse, ready for collection in the morning.
 

 The Irishman was alone, and he felt alone too. If there was any part of his now forgotten life when he had ever experienced such loneliness, he was glad it was gone from his head, he didn’t want it back. He lay on his bunk, and dozed, and smoked and drank. But there was no fun in ignoring people when there was no one there to ignore.

 One day there was a knock at the door. The Irishman hadn’t thought he’d be wanted ever again. There was a costume waiting for him, his familiar dirty tramp outfit. He put it on, warily. No doubt he was to be teamed with another Englishman and another Scotsman, but they’d be strangers to him. He just hoped there’d be some natural chemistry between them. Comedy was no good without the chemistry.

 He went out on to the battlefield. He had been wrong. He had no new partners. He was now a solo act.

 There was this Irishman, and he was fighting in some war. Probably. And he got captured by the enemy. And the enemy thought he was a spy, and sentenced him to death by firing squad. And so that’s what they did – they shot him.

 There wasn’t much humour to be gleaned from that, the Irishman felt afterwards. The audience hadn’t even wanted him to say anything. There he’d been, all prepared to shout out the punchline, he’d got his cheesy grin all ready and had opened his mouth, but it was too late, the bullets tore him to pieces.

 He thought it’d be different the next time. 

It wasn’t.

 This was the new comedy. It didn’t want to waste time on setup, on delay, on delivery. It didn’t care about pace, charm or timing. Without the Englishman and the Scotsman to layer the gag, the joke could cut to the chase. The Irishman could come on, and they’d shoot him, or they’d flay his skin to make a canoe, or they’d stick pineapples up his arse.
 And the unseen crowds would laugh and stomp their feet and holler for more – and the Irishman couldn’t quite see what it was that so entertained them. He was just dying, where was the skill in that? He didn’t even have time to pull a funny face.
 Back in his room he’d rehearse. Try to adjust to the new act. He concentrated on the pratfalls he so loved, because he could at least be sure at some point there’d be a spot of falling over to be done. He devised amusing ways he could collapse in death. He tried his best. But the truth of it was, for all his hard work and preparation, in performance it never went the way he planned. The impact of the bullets burst his body open, and if it burst at an amusing angle it had really very little to do with him.

 Still, the Irishman was very popular. 

He got lots of bookings.


 There was this Irishman, and they shot him. 

There was a simplicity to that he supposed he should be proud of. As he stood before the firing squad, he knew he was dying for his country. It made him feel better somehow. It gave him an identity. Some days he went out to work with something of a swagger in his step.
 There was this Irishman, and he was captured, and put before the firing squad. They denied him the padre, they denied him the solace of a final cigarette. The soldiers all pointed their rifles at him, and the captain began to give the orders to shoot him, as he’d done so many countless times before.


 The Irishman looked out amongst his killers, and saw there a face he recognised.


 He stepped forward.


 ‘It’s all right,’ he said.


 Because she was so frightened. Maybe it was her first time. He didn’t know if she remembered him. He saw in her face all the primness the Englishman had taught her, all the meanness the Scotsman had made her practise hard. And he saw what he’d given her, that she was as thick as shit in the neck of a bottle.
 And, oh, she was beautiful, she’d been miscast, surely? She shouldn’t have been a killer. Those eyes, that hair. 
 Her rifle trembled as he approached. She tried to say something, her tongueless mouth opened and closed and opened again.
 ‘It’s all right,’ he said once more. ‘You’re doing fine, darlin’.’ He took hold of the rifle barrel, moved it so it pressed lightly against his throat. ‘I’m proud of you, and all the folks out there are proud of you. You’re going to be a star.’ He gave her a smile, and she managed a smile back, and he knew that it was all worth it, and there was not a laugh out there in the whole wide world that could spoil it.
 ‘Pull the trigger,’ he whispered. She did.",45
A motherfucker walks into a tavern.,"As the motherfucker approaches the barmaiden, a well dressed nobleman shouts at the motherfucker from across the room: ""Ahoy! You there! You look like you fuck mothers! Come over here!""

The motherfucker obliges. After approaching the nobleman the motherfucker asks: ""How can you tell I'm a motherfucker?""

The nobleman replies: ""Is your question made in jest? It's very obvious! It's your gait and that shit-eating grin of yours. Only a motherfucker walks into an establishment in a manner such as yours, as if looking for someone's mother to fuck but I digress. I'd like to hire your services. An old acquaintance of mine, a fellow nobleman has insulted me and caused harm to my sensitivities with a vulgar and unflattering letter. I need you to locate his estate, seduce and then fuck his mother in response, at my behest, motherfucker. I'll pay 20 in coin for you to undertake this quest, then 100 upon completion of this important endeavour. Will you accept?""

The motherfucker accepts the nobleman's offer. After receiving directions to the target's home, the motherfucker ventures out to fulfill his motherfucking contract. As he walks the ""King's Road"" he hears someone shouting: ""Stop! Hold it right there, you fucker of mothers! Cease your movement of legs to gain forward momentum, by the order of the king!"" The motherfucker sighs and turns around to face three knights on horseback.

""How are you able to discern that I am indeed a fucker of mothers?"" Asks the motherfucker, now slightly irritated.

The lead knight scoffs and replies: ""Only experienced motherfuckers such as yourself thrust their pelvises for each step they take. That goulish, wide grin isn't doing you any favours either, motherfucker.""

The motherfucker, grinning even when frustrated, replies: ""By the heavens, I guess discretion is not my strong suit, rather fucking mothers is.""

""Silence, you insufferable fornicator of mothers! I loathe you people, you better not fuck any of ours while out here. I can tell by the brisk in your walk and the vigor of your crotch movements that you're on a mission as we speak. Carry on then, motherfucker! You best stay away from mine!"" The lead knight remarks before he spits onto the paved road. ""You people are worse than rapists! I'll make you pay a toll the next time we cross paths on this road!"" He says finally, before the knights carry on riding

The motherfucker continues to travel, feeling a bit discouraged now. At some point, he crosses paths with a farmer that simply says: ""Good evening, motherfucker."" The motherfucker rolls his eyes and tries to adjust the way he moves and also trains on maintaining a blank facial expression during the remainder of his trip. After two hours, he finally reaches the manor that was described by the nobleman.

He inhales and exhales once deeply and walks through a yard leading to the manor. He has already rehearsed his lines, planning on pretending to be a tradesman. The other targeted nobleman promptly rushes outside, seemingly enraged and yells: ""You motherfucker, you! Stay where you are!""

The motherfucker almost wails in frustration as he yells back: ""Come on! What?! How can you possibly already be aware that I'm here to fuck your mother?!""

The nobleman replies: ""What?! No, don't come any closer unless you have a pair of glasses to put on, you fucking moron. You have stepped on numerous flowerbeds that are filled with my prized tulips!""",121

An agitated Lord Voldemort is sat in a private helicopter enroute to Portland in Oregon,"He's not happy; he's not satisfied.

For the last 850 years, he's had to endure life on Earth, but finally he may be snapping; he may have had enough.

Sure, the mansion in Portland is great. Sure, the fresh supply of 18 and 19 years old each week is great. Sure, the sex is great. Sure, the beach house in Malibu is awesome sometimes - and the penthouse in Seattle...and the chalet in Nice. Yeah, great, all great. But Lord Voldemort has grown agitated and restless.

So, one day, in 2027, he begins to sell off all of his assets. He then chops off his legs and arms and regrows new strong, long limbs. He then grows a dark black layer of skin, creates a new identity for himself using his sorcery and zips over to Senegal - a former state which had just recently endured a 5-year-long civil war and was now practically three ""countries"".

Standing at 7 foot and 3 inches, he uses his sorcery and masculine and domineering persona and strong voice to persuade millions to have him as their leader. He persuades them that under his lifelong dictatorship, they can have a good, long life with security and safety and distributed wealth.

By 2030, the Kingdom of Senegal has been recognised by the UN and all countries bar Australia and New Zealand.

By 2033, the Kingdom of Senegal has expanded into Mauritania and Mali.

By 2035, six more West African countries all hold referendums to voluntarily join the Kingdom.

By 2036, the Kingdom of Senegal has peacefully annexed most of West Africa and parts of North Africa.

All the while, Lord Voldemort has been using his sorcery to get away with this and has not had to deal with much resistance - except from the Australians and Kiwis, who strangely appear to be immune to his sorcery.

By 2040, the Kingdom of Senegal has an official surface area of 1.6million square miles.

By 2041, the Kingdom of Senegal has a successful space agency with an annual budget of 2 billion Euros and a ten year plan for six missions to Mars, Callisto, Venus and near-Jupiter space.

By 2042, Lord Voldemort is King and lifelong Dictator of over 600 million people. By now, hundreds of millions of people across Africa and the Americas and parts of Asia are reaching out to Voldemort and wish to join the Kingdom.

Using his sorcery, Voldemort begins to slowly and gradually take over the world.

No rush - he has, after all, got ""all the time in the world"".",7
I like my women like I like my coffee:,"Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as ""beans"") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.

Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world, and it can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte). It is usually served hot, although iced coffee is a popular alternative.

Clinical studies indicate that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption reduces the risk of some diseases, although those long-term studies are generally of poor quality.",3

What did 50 do when he was hungry?,"He went to his nearest source of foodular provision services. He always thought it was quite tacky the way people referred to them as restaurants. He tried ordering his favourite meal, but was denied. “We don’t serve numbers,” they said. 50 was frustrated. This wasn’t his first rodeo. These horses should not be this difficult to control. But nonetheless, he pulled out his revolver. Nothing like a gun to spice up a situation you take for granted. Everyone looked at him wide-eyed, wondering what kind of a number had stepped inside the building. In the distance, a simp could be heard pausing his simpery for a good few seconds. Kids in Africa forgot about their thirst. The globe stopped warming. If you really listened closely, you could even hear the sound of a Karen not asking for the manager. 50 tried intensely to not pay attention to these distractions. He would not be swayed this easily. Upon further inspection of the firearm by a nearby man named Fire Arm, he recognised that the gun was fake. A toy. Tensions were high. Much like your mom on a breezy Sunday evening. But an employee decided that he had had enough. He was confused. He didn’t know what the point of this story was. So he served 50 the meal he wanted. What kind of a cruel joke would create imaginary characters, create a point of undeniable stress, and then leave the viewers hanging? Anyway, 58",1

Man balks in a war,"""Man knew it would not survive another world war. And man lives, having seen the horrors of space war, not knowing if survival is a blessing or a curse.

In space, no one can dream. Man balks in a war. A giant tear for mankind.

Man knows suffering is a perfume you cannot pour on others without getting some on yourself.

Man cries for perfume, for all earthly beauty: the Parthenon, the San Marco, every DVD copy of War Horse. A lost world, set, never to rise. Yet some moments, the faint burnt smell of space gives way to memories of stupefying scents.

Mother: ""Why are you wearing my cologne?"" Father: ""You are no child of mine."" Space Warkeeper: ""Whythelongface?"" Man is alone, yet the voices remain. Man wishes to be a child, to unsee what was seen, to unhear what is still being heard. To take up no space but the womb.

Two polar bears are sitting in a bathtub.,"One polar bear says to the other, ""Pass the radio.""

The other polar bear begins to pass the radio, but it falls into the bathtub, electrocuting both polar bears. They go to heaven and meet St. Peter at the pearly gates.

""Suicide is a sin, so I'm afraid I'm going to have to send you to hell.""

""I didn't want to die, I just asked for the radio!"" complained the first polar bear.

""I did not mean to kill us, the radio slipped out of my hands!"" the second polar bear chimed in.

""If you truly were just bathing,"" St. Peter pressed, ""then why was there no soap?""

The radio awoke from the nightmare, drenched in sweat and gasping for breath. ""I died too, but I didn't go to heaven, meaning I don't even have a soul!""

My day with Bill Clinton,"When I entered Mr. Clinton's mansion, he zoomed through the dull pleasantries and immediately said he wanted to show me something. Something of the utmost importance. 

“I’m just here for our interview Mr.- “ 

“Listen, Ike”, Bill interrupted, assigning me a nickname I would continue to bear throughout the day, “I’m kind of a big fuckin’ deal, so you’re just gonna have to cool your god damn jets”. 

I couldn’t argue. This was perhaps the biggest interview of my career, so I followed without protest. The floors we were walking on were as ornate as the decor of the building. The black and white checkered marble tiling gave way to a gorgeous stucco wall covered in fine paintings and tapestries. The hallway alone looked like something out of Caligula's palace. To be fair, the scores of nude women who reclined on the expensive-looking furniture may have skewed my perception. Adorned upon the walls—which were already dripping with ivy wreaths and Ionian columns chiseled from the finest, whitest marble—was painting after painting. 

“This one’s a Rothko,” he said, noticing my preoccupation. He chuckled to himself as if he had just told me an extremely clever joke. “I’ve got a few more in my closet upstairs. C’mon, Hoss. We’re going that way anyhow.” 

We made our way to his room, and he kept pointing out vases and paintings. Saying they were from “the golden age of vasedom”, and “the neo-post-classical era of pastel”. I think he just made up terms to impress me. 

After what seemed like a two-hour tour of the portrait gallery led by someone who just started their art history elective, we finally arrived at a set of doors. I’m not sure why it struck me the way it did that the doors were so tall, but nevertheless I found myself almost impressed for the first time. Bill must have seen this in my face because he began prattling on about how they were aged oak doors. 

“The same kind they use for wine barrels.”

He neglected to mention the “KEEP OUT” and “NO GIRLS ALLOWED” signs, hand-drawn on pieces of notebook paper. But they were taped on all the same. With great showmanship, he kicked the doors open like a cowboy bursting into a saloon. His room looked like it hadn’t changed since he was 17. There were posters on nearly every square inch of the walls and Cape Cod-style slanted ceiling, mostly for 80s rock bands. There was a large poster of Slash on the back of one of his doors, and above his racecar bed there was a huge Grateful Dead tapestry. 

“Welcome to the Pleasure Dome,” he said. 

Bill made his way to his closet, and I quickly said, “Oh, Mr. Clinton, I really don’t need to see your other Rothkoes, we should just get to the interview.”

“Oh, yeah, the Rothkoes. That’s okay. We’ll get to those another day then. That’s not what I’m getting”. He rummaged around his closet, and in the bottom of a cardboard box, labeled “homework”, he pulled out a can of soda. He brought it back to the center of the room and took a seat in his beanbag chair. 

“Pop a squat!” he said, motioning to the egg-chair opposite his bean bag throne. I took a seat on the oval chair next to one of his train sets. As I was taking my seat, I noticed Bill unscrewing the top of his ersatz soda can and extracting a glass pipe and a grinder. 

“If my mom ever finds my weed, she’d totally freak,” he said. He began to pack the bowl, so I took out my recorder and set it down. At long last the interview could begin. 

“So, mister Clinton,” I said. “Your foundation is-”

“C’mon man, hit this,” he said, trying to keep the smoke in as interrupted. I tried to tell him no, but he kept pushing. “This is really good weed, man. If you don’t hit this, you’re basically wasting it.” I told him I really didn’t want to get high right now but looked at me with a twinkle in his eye and said, “that’s okay, man, we’ll just get a little high.” He shot me a wink. We did not get just a little high. 

Every time the bowl emptied, I watched Bill produce more flower to pack it full again. Bowl after bowl was smoked, and somewhere around bowl number fourteen I begged him to stop. I could barely think straight, and it felt like my heart was going to beat out of my chest. 

“I didn’t know you were gonna be such a gay little pussy,” Bill Clinton said, ignoring my pleas and handing me the pipe for one more rip. I took a little puff, and Bill said, “you didn’t even inhale! What are you running for congress?” I sighed and allowed myself to enter Bill’s headspace. I laid back on his racecar bed as at long last he put away his herb and paraphernalia. 

“You wanna hear me play the saxophone?” Bill asked as he emerged from the closet empty-handed. I couldn’t remember how to talk, but he took my silence in the affirmative. He began rummaging through the trunk of his bed, and finally produced a set of VHS tapes. He put one in the TV across the room and turned the dial to channel 4. The tape was a recording of him on some late-night talk show campaigning for something. He was playing careless whisper. 

“Pretty sweet, huh”, he asked rhetorically. “Alright, I guess I’m ready to do your little interview or whatever.” Finally. I pulled out my recorder and found myself at a loss for words. My head was too clouded from Bill Clinton’s dank. 

“What, uh... So, do you think that… did the moon landing happen?” I heard myself ask. 

Bill chuckled to himself. “You know, Ike, the moon landing was just one of those things, you know? When they first let me into the White House, I asked the same thing, and do you know what they told me?” He looked at me for affirmation. I shrugged. He didn’t say anything, he just winked at me. I’m not sure I’ve seen anyone wink as much as Bill did. 

The talk show host was asking questions now, as Bill had finished playing for the crowd, so he stood up and turned off the TV. He sauntered over to a box and pulled out the Dark Side of the Moon album. He put it on his player. 

“Hey,” he said, barely holding in a chuckle. “Do you wanna hear about my newest art project?”

With great effort, I managed a nod.

“So, like, I’m gonna just shit. Shit all over a canvas, right? And then I’m gonna like, scrape it all around with a palette knife, and then,” he wheezed a laugh. “Then I’m gonna sell it at an auction, and the money is gonna go to the Clinton foundation!” He fell to the ground and laughed hard and long at his own joke. He wiped tears from his eyes. 

“Aw man. Bill Clinton cracks himself up.'' He was doubled over, laughing those hard, breathy laughs that only a man with leather lungs could muster. “But seriously man, check this out.” Bill began spinning the record backwards with his bare fingers. Pink Floyd blared through the speakers, backward and distorted. The haunting anti-melodies intruded my already clouded mind, and I saw great visions of vast deserts. At that very moment, Bill Clinton came to me in a vision. He towered over me, roaring saxophone notes into the dry, Coptic air. My body emerged from a great woven basket in the form of a snake as his hard-bop post-jazz aroused me from my slumber. I rose and rose, and Bill played louder and louder, and the notes turned into a message that I strained to hear. I yearned to understand what Bill was trying to tell me. I leaned my snake-body forward, craning my long back, aching to know Bill’s secret knowledge-

“THERE IT IS!” he yelled. The music halted and I was lucid again. “Listen,” he said with the crazed intensity of a lunatic. Every word that came out of his mouth had the grave seriousness of a schizophrenic man telling you exactly how the world will end. “Listen really closely, Ike. This is where Roger Waters told me I was the Messiah. He told me that I will be a great ruler and bring peace to the kingdom of Israel in the great and terrifying end times. Do you hear it, man? Can you hear Roger’s guitar talking to me? He’s telling me, man. He’s telling me.”

Bill had worked up quite a sweat. With every word he said his neck strained tighter. Every muscle in his face ached in a competition to see which one could contort hardest. The tendons in his neck strained hard enough that I thought they would burst from under his skin. 

“Man, it’s a good thing I didn’t listen when I was in the Oval Office… There wouldn’t be a fuckin’ Iran anymore, I can tell you that much. Shit, man. There wouldn’t be an England either. Her majesty Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of her other realms and- man FUCK you!” As he said this last part, he slammed his fist on the turntable, hard enough to split the record.

“Aw, I’m sorry, man. No more Waters. I guess I turned Waters into whine, huh?” Again, Bill howled at his own joke. “C’mon, man. I’ve got one last thing I want you to see.”

We left his room and went back down the grand, Corinthian staircase. As we walked, Bill produced a joint from behind his ear and lit it up. In two great sucks, it vanished to nothing but a filter. He flicked it haphazardly aside, and I noted the circular charcoal stain it left on the head of the priceless marble statue. It bounced off and rolled back down the hall before it finally stopped at Bill’s feet. One of his many women appeared to pick up the roach. Her bare feet pattered against the tile and she scurried directly in front of Mr. Clinton, cutting him off. 

“You bitch!” He roared. “Do you think Bill Clinton is paying you to get in his goddamn way?” The small, dark woman shrank into herself as Bill towered over her. Her naked body pushed further into the cold, hard floor, as she held her hands in front of her face. Mr. Clinton rose his great pale hand into the air.

“What the hell is your name?'' he said, hand still poised for attack. 

“Juanita,” she said. 

“No, it isn’t! In Bill Clinton’s house, only Bill has a name! Do you understand?”

Her voice was small and squeaky. “I’m so sorry Mr. Clinton, sir. It will not happen again. Please, Mr. Clinton sir, please don’t hurt me”. 

“Aww hell,'' he finally said. “Make yourself useful and pick up the roach. It won’t be the only butt you get to pinch today.” He prodded me with his elbow and winked for the umpteenth time. “We like to have fun around here,'' he said. “Don’t put this in your story.”

As we rounded the final corner, a flock of maids skittered away like roaches. Behind them, the entrance to a great open room. Inside, vines twisted over us like great verdant rafters, rocked by zephyrs that curled between looming Grecian columns. 
“I like to come here when I want to have a big ole think,” said Bill. He rubbed his chin, and stood for a while in pensive silence. We watched the wind sway the vines, and the birds in the trees. Finally, Bill broke the silence.

“I keep having this dream, man. I’m in a forest, and I’m surrounded by tribesman—you know the type. Big boys with some meat on ‘em. The kinda fellas who you just know are looking to eat either you or your horse, depending on what kinda day they’ve had? Hell, that’s the only reason I gave those Chayannese boys their eagle feathers, who knows who they would’ve eaten?” He sparked another joint and took a long drag.

“But I’m in these woods, surrounded by these fellas, and Ike, believe me when I tell you they are mean. They look at me like I am just the worst president in the whole wide world, and suddenly their head honcho, or chief, or morubixaba—I think they’re Tupi—comes over and says something like ‘ongo bongo welcome to our jongle,’ and I’m not gonna look a warrior like that in the eye and say no! But I guess he doesn’t know that, or he sees that I’m not really into it, so he gives his men some sort of look and they tie me up and drag me off and we go down this long and winding path.

“For hours, man, we’re just trudging deeper and deeper into the humid darkness, and off deep in the trees along the path, I swear I see something. But the longer I look out into the darkness of the canopy or whatever they call it, the more I think there’s nothing there at all and all the while, these boys keep dragging me into the thick of it. And the sounds, Ike, they’re like nothing you could believe. I’ve only heard the birds here in the U. S. of A. and maybe a few of the socialist ones, and maybe some monarchical ones in the sandier regions back during my reign, but man, these birds! They make the strangest sounds. It’s like a buzz and a whine, and a few pops—I can’t describe it right, but you’ve just gotta believe me on this, no one has ever heard these sounds outside of the furthest depths of the Amazonian jungle. 

“So, these bird sounds keep getting stranger and stranger, and the path gets more clear, and suddenly, we’re back in a village full of tribal women and children. All around me I hear people and birds chittering, and the tribesmen keep pulling me and take me to this massive, Texas-sized wigwam, and inside is the oldest man I’ve ever seen. This wrinkled old glove-face Indian is just sitting there, lit up by the fire he’s stirring, and without looking up he motions for me to come in.

“‘Welcome back,’ he says, and man, I wish I could remember if he said that the first dream. But before I can get to thinking too long about what he means, he says ‘Ole Bill, now I’m gonna tell you something important, so listen up.’ He says, ‘you’ve been chosen, and I don’t just mean to save America. You’ve been chosen to save the whole world.’ Now of course, I’m a little taken aback by this. I mean, you know me, I already know I’m the Messiah and all, but this Indian seems to think I’ve been chosen for something even more important. Now, the Indian starts loading up a long pipe with some pretty stank-ass vegetable matter, if you catch my drift, Ike. Then he tells me, ‘try not to forget what I’m about to tell you.’ He takes a long drag of his long pipe, he holds it in, then he blows it out into my face. Now, I don’t know Indian culture and etiquette, but I do know normal etiquette, and that’s just not a very kind thing to do in Arkansas, so I start to yell at him. Well, I try, but as soon as I open my mouth, I find I can’t.

“Suddenly, my whole body is made of wood and I’m like this giant ungahari tree. For some reason, I know I’ve been watching over these people for eons. My mind is flooded with the secrets of the galaxy, and the universe and stuff. And it’s all flowing in from the earth mother down below, up through my roots, like I’m the universe’s knowledge antenna. And I’m so totally discombobulated that I just have to wake up and recombobulate myself, or the whole universe will disappear! At which point, I of course find I cannot. It’s not until I give in and allow myself to live the life of every human being who has ever lived that I can finally rest. I just have to sit there and endure every act of evil and kindness that ever has and ever will occur, all while these Indians strip away my bark to roll fat-ass blunts with. Are you still following, Ike? Because this is when it starts getting really good.

“So once I finish living every life, and having every single human emotion—and by the way, did you know that happiness in the ‘30s feels different than it does now? And that sadness in the Roman Empire was a vastly different sensation than it is right now, but in the future, it becomes the same again? Never mind, it doesn’t matter. So, the earth mother comes to me in the form of a leopard. Like, the spirit of the earth itself, just sitting there in a leopard body. I know she’s the earth mother, and she knows I’m Bill Clinton. But at this point, I’ve entirely forgotten the concept of self, because of the whole living everyone’s life bit. But she says to me, ‘now do you understand?’ Ike, she’s so kind about it too. She gently paws a little bug off of my root that was squirming around and tickling me, and I tell her, ‘I don’t know,’ because I don’t know. Now, I don’t think leopards can smile, but Gia does, and she says, ‘that’s okay little one, you don’t need to. Just don’t forget what we’ve shown you.’ and then, finally, I wake up.”

Bill stared at me for a long time. He was out of breath. I was still pretty high, so I was having some trouble remembering all of the details of his story, but my tape recorder got it. “Sounds like a crazy dream, man,” I said. I wished he would stop looking at me with his crazed, red eyes. 

“No, man. That was no dream,” he said. “That was the real world. What were in right now, that’s the dream,” he said. “Weren’t you listening to anything I said, man? That’s the real world! I’ve lived your life a thousand times, and I’ve lived mine a thousand. We’ve had this entire conversation a thousand times! I know you better than you know yourself, and I know with certainty what’s going to happen in the world we’ll leave behind.” He threw a piece of gravel through one of the windows in the ceiling of his arboretum and screamed. 

“I am everyone, everyone is me! Don’t you get it? Don’t you understand anything? Why are you asking me questions about the damn Clinton Foundation? You should be asking me about why I, the god that created this very universe, picked Pi exactly the way I did! Why did I, your creator, make Hydrogen the way I made it! Why did I pick the gravitational constant in such a way that you could exist? Aren’t you even a little curious?” 

Bill was beginning to worry me, so I started backing away. 

“Aww heck,” he said. “I’m just teasin’, Ike.” He clapped me on the back. “But don’t forget, I’ve already lived your life a thousand times, so I know what you’re going to say about me. I don’t mind. Don’t bother sending me a review copy, just publish what you’re going to publish.” 

I all but ran out of the room, past his harem, to the front door. Before I could get it open, Bill put his hand on it, holding it closed. 
“Ike,” he said. ""Just one thing I don't want you to mention in your story."" He glared at me, returning to his snake form, filling the room with his serpentine presence and the foul, olfactory symphony of death. I was but a cockroach standing before the god that was Bill Clinton as he hissed and swung his enormous body up through the glass ceiling, shattering it, just like Hillary. He swooped back down, inches from me and spoke in a slow, melodic voice. 

""When you mention my bed"", he hissed, eyes beginning to glow red. ""Lie about the wheels.""",75
a japanese man walks into a bar,"
An M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle to be precise

The year is 1945 and the place is Okinawa

The Japanese man collapses gripping his stomach and begins to weep as torn bits of his intestines begin coming out from the bullet hole.

His comrades swarm over him, ignoring his cries as their combined weight snaps his bones like twigs. The soldier who fired the bar, an American, is impaled by the bayonets of dozens of fanatical soldiers.

The shot Japanese man rolls over onto his side, the pain is gone and the sounds and screams of the battle around him muted.

Old, forgotten memories begin playing through his head like a slideshow

He sees memories of him having the happiest time with his family

He sees himself posing with a big smile next to his newly\-wed wife, their child was expected soon

He relives when he received the letter that his father had been killed fighting the Chinese hordes

That was what made him join the army

That was what had killed him

He smiled sadly and closed his eyes, into a realm of darkness in which he would never again see light.",2

“You lied to me!?” said Gay the Horse. 
“Will you shouldn’t have trusted me to give you a car.” said the bartender, chidingly
Gay the horse, enraged prepares to punch the bartender but then he notices that the bartender is already being punched by Rick Astley. 
“Could you stop punching the bartender for a second. I want to beat him up.” Gay the horse says. 
“Sorry mate,” said Rick Astley “but if you want to punch the bartender you’ll have to wait in line.” 
Rick Astley gestured to a long line of people behind him.
“ Wait a second.” said a priest who was enjoying a drink at the bar. “Why is there a line of people waiting to punch the bartender? How did the horse not previously notice this? And why is the horse talking? Horses can’t talk.” 
“That’s because none of this is actually happening.” said the bartender “This is all just a bad joke being posted in r/antiantijokes.” 
“Wait a minute, you mean all of my life is an illusion?” Gay the horse says. Overwhelmed with existential horror he breaks into tears.

A gown man ate an entire pie in his car,"As he wiped the bits of leftover pie off his face, dabbing the collar of his shirt against his lips to remove the purple stains, he heard a tapping at his window, looking over to see a police officer standing outside. Rolling down the window he gave the officer a nod, placing the empty tray aside. “Morning officer, are you having a peachy day?”

“I’m fine, I just got called to check out a suspicious individual. The reports said you were licking the crust of a pie, talking about how you would destroy it once you got into the car. As you can expect a lot of people were concerned with your comments.”

“Concerned enough to call the cops? Look, it was just a bit of fun, I did destroy the pie too, see that empty tray next to me? I did that, just dug in and destroyed that pie. It was delicious. As you can see officer, there’s nothing weird, I was just enjoying a snack.”

“A snack? You ate a whole pie as a snack?” The officer leaned down towards his chest, whispering into his phone. “Yeah, going to need back up, there’s a freak eating pie in his car.”

“Psst, eating pie? I’m sure you can handle that?” The voice on the phone seemed less than thrilled by the officer's concerns, nearly hanging up, only for the officer to say something that got his attention.

“He ate the entire thing in his car. This isn’t a normal guy.” The officer must have thought he was being quiet, giving the man a reassuring thumbs up as he listened to the conversation.

“The entire thing? Was he at least crying? Maybe he was having a breakdown?” The voice tried to be rational, tried to think of a way to justify the threat, but there was none.

The officer leaned closer to him, dragging his tongue along the man’s eyelid, rolling his tongue back into his mouth before responding to the phone. “Not even an ounce of salt on his eyes.”

“Stay safe, I’m calling in the big guns.” The phone buzzed off as the officer freed his gun from its restraint. “Ok, hands in the air, I need you to step out of the vehicle.”

Still being mentally disturbed by the lick, the man panicked, throwing his arms up only to realize that he couldn’t leave the car with his hands up. “Can you.... Open the door for me? My hands are in the air.” As soon as the man finished the sentence, a bullet fired at the car, knocking off his side mirror. Dropping his arms down, he did what any sane person would do. Stomped on the accelerator and fled, having to duck as a spray of bullets followed his escape.

The man could hear the cop screaming at him as he exited the parking lot. “YOU BETTER RUN YOU FREE THINKER!” As the cop said that, it was like the man had a moment of clarity. He was an adult, he could do whatever he wanted. Mortal restraints could not bind him. The man pushed open the car door, leaping out of the moving vehicle. Instead of rolling down the road, he instead floated, hovering above the floor. The cars moving past him seemed slower, allowing him to sidestep the oncoming traffic. He had reached enlightenment.

He could hear tugging tanks on the horizon, each drawing near with their weapons facing him. Their weapons couldn’t hurt him. Anything that was shot his way just vanished, he was a God, the pie God. 


...at least he *was* until a blackness consumed him, waking up on a hospital bed, a few concerned nurses staring down at him.

“Oh, you're awake? You passed out after choking on a handful of pie. Why were you even eating pie in a carpark weirdo? Not that it matters, I’m just glad that you woke up from that nightmare, you wouldn’t stop making weird noises, a few of the other nurses really thought you would die.”

The man didn’t know how to respond to that; it had all felt so real. “Sorry” Was all he could mumble, the nurse giving him a nod before leaving to recover. Beside the man sat the half-eaten pie, still in its beautiful silver tin. Well, one more bite wouldn’t hurt.",3

A man walks into a bar.,"He staggers in puzzled as there is no bartender to be found. The only thing there is an old TV, shining brightly in the darkened establishment. As he slowly approaches the bar counter, he hears a hissing noise and notices static snow on the TV.

Disillusioned of a bar with no bartender, the man reaches behind the counter and pours himself a shot of whiskey into a highball glass. He raises the glass, tilts his head back, and takes a gulp. The man then turns his attention back and attempts to change the channel on the TV. He clicks it twice and suddenly a picture appears. He gazes into the set and notices...

A man misses his wife,"“Oh how I’ve missed my wife!” came the wail from the man at the bar next to me. He repeated the refrain in various forms while taking long gulps from his drink, causing me to question the choice of this uncomfortable seat I had picked. 


“She moved so quickly! It caused me to miss her so!” His eyes rolled like a horse, the man was clearly a lunatic, albeit with a charming love of his wife. The chair squeaked again. Definitely a poor choice.


“Always darting here and there!” he cried, and he began gesturing wildly. 


His arms raised, I saw in his belt was a revolver. Now I saw the danger in this man. I tried to scoot away, but the chair would have none of it. 


“Breaking news update” came the sound from the TV at the bar. “Deranged man on the loose after attempted homicide. Please be cautious and stay indoors.” 


Now I turned to the man to see him waving the gun, shouting “Wife! Wife! Wife!” over and over. I tried to get up but the chair confounded me again. My head snapped this way and that around the bar but no one looked over, as if by ignoring the man he wouldn’t be real to them. I tried to disengage from the chair but my hip was caught. 


But lo, police came in! As I saw them enter through the door I pointed at the man and shouted “ There! That’s the man you want!” But they both scurried over to me and gripped roughly under my arms. “No, not me!” I protested. “That man!”


“Sir, stop resisting.” Said the man to my right. “That’s a chair.” 


“And please, try to be decent! You’re in public!” Said the man to my left.


But I couldn’t hear them over the shouts of the crazy man and my laborious sex with the chair.",8

""That a British accent?"" The man asks.

""Yes,"" he smiles.

The man produces 3 banknotes from his pocket and replies ""two of your most expensive wines, bud.""

The barman takes the money, gets two bottles from the top shelf and hands the man back his change.

""Sir, your wine,"" the barman frowns.

""Don't worry about it - give it to someone else,"" the man grins back and then walks out.

Later that day, as the bar is closing, the manager is counting up the cash in the till. The manager then gasps and calls the barman over.

""What the hell, William!""

""Sir?"" The barman replies.

""Someone has given you foreign cash dammmit!"" The manager barks angrily and waves three banknotes in the air.

""What?"" The barman looks closely and gasps. ""Wh-what are they? Weren't they hundred dollar bills?""

""Syrian pounds! Goddamn Syrian pounds! 3 two-thousand pound Syrian banknotes!""

The barman frowns and for a second becomes hopeful.

""That...sounds like a lot of money, sir? I could exchange...""

""No, dammit! That's like 12 dollars!""

The barman's frown deepens. ""I don't get it...how did that happen?""

The manager sighs and calms down a little. ""Oh, forget about it. There are rumours of a guy called Severus. He allegedly traipses around towns and cities in Wisconsin, Ohio and Illinois carrying tons of Syrian banknotes.

A priest and a rabbi walk into into a bar...,"The rabbi claims his regular stool and the priest orders the same old order of two scotches on the rocks. Except they aren’t rocks, they are ice cubes.

‘I think I want a divorce.’ exclaimed the rabbi.

‘What? Why? What did I do wrong?’ the priest shrilled

Foolish priest. You never got married what are you talking about.

You see, these religious figures had been friends  for all their life, fulfilling the same, mundane day-to-day routines. Going to the same old bar with the same old drinks. It seemed it be enough for them. 

‘I’m going to have to cut you off you have had too many drinks, sir.’ said the bartender to the priest.

‘What? This is my first and only drink?’

The priest gazed upon the sullen beauty of the waxy-faced bartender. Years of mental torment reflected in his eyes.

That’s when a horse made its way inside, presumably sheltering from the rain. At least I think it’s raining. I like to think so. It could just be the sound of the air-conditioning. It is rather cold in here. It’s always felt cold since my wife left me for the Egyptian dentist that lives next door. Did you know that ancient Egyptians used crushed mice brains as toothpaste? Neither did i. Fascinating isn’t it. Please Sharon come back I miss you so much.

That’s when the bartender looked at the horse and snarled ‘Why the long face?’ 

‘I’m so sick of your shit, Gilbert.’ The horse turned and walked out, like Sharon. Please Sharon.

The rabbi whipped out his fidget spinner to distract himself from the immense tension in the room. Leaving his wife meant he would only have the priest in his life. He is all he’ll have left.

‘I am going to lay out a scenario for you. You have two doors, two paths to take. Two options. One consists of fulfilling the next phase in your life. A life without your wife. The other you keep your wife, but lose the priest. Whichever you choose, I’m sure the other will be in your heart forever.’ 

The rabbi stared at the priest. A life without him? 
He couldn’t. Never.

‘I know what I have to do.’ shouted the priest as he arose from his seat. He flees the scene.

‘My oh my is that the time already?’ Said the bartender. He ripped off his uniform revealing the sexy burlesque costume underneath.

The rabbi gazed upon the stars (I knew it wasn’t raining I just lied earlier). Staring at the moon he knew that the priest would always be there for him. A lifelong friendship. Beautiful isn’t it. An unbroken bond to last a century.

‘Dude, where’s my car?’ cried the rabbi. His vehicle indeed wasn’t there. That’s when the war began.",151

Marshall replies next: ""Me and Lily had an argument which escalated into violence, last night.

Ted rolls his eyes. Marshall looks anxious and recoils when a female server that looks similar to Lily walks past their booth.

The audience are still laughing until Ted slams his fist into the table and yells at them:

""Shut the FUCK up! What is the matter with you?! Nothing that's been said here has been even remotely close to funny! Marshall is OBVIOUSLY all jittery and traumatized from his abusive wife, /I'M/ fucking depressed because Robin left me for good in the last episode! I want to die! FUCK you! Are you still amused!?""

"Engelbert, a Swede, has just died and is in heaven","He sees God sitting on a throne nearby and walks over.

""Hi God,"" Engelbert smiles, trying to strike up a friendly conversation with the Most High.

""Hello, Engelbert, my child,"" God replies majestically.

""You know, whilst I was alive down on Earth I've always had this unanswered question. Your prophets couldn't answer, priests couldn't answer and the Bible said nothing,"" Engelbert says.

""What is it, my child? Out with it..."" God booms back proudly.

""Well, black people... Popular theory says you burnt them whilst making them - is this true?"" Engelbert stutters.

""Oh, you mean Indians?"" God replies, suddenly visibly uneasy.

""Um, no..."" Engelbert frowns. ""Black people. The folks from Africa?""

Silence.

""That wasn't me,"" God says and turns away, averting his eyes and pretending to be busy with a supernova simulation.

""What?"" Engelbert says, stunned.

""I didn't make Black people. Yes, I accidentally burnt the Indians - I was busy with a multiverse simulation...gimme a break. But blacks? Nope, not me. Nothing to do with me.""

""Then...who did?"" Engelbert gawped up at God.

An irritated look crosses God's face.

"Eric, a CIA operative, is beginning to suspect that millions of people have been replaced by aliens from space","Eric also suspects that his parents, grandparents, siblings and girlfriend have all been replaced by aliens who are disguising themselves as his family and friends.

One day, Eric comes home, armed with a Glock 45 and 4 magazines, enough bullets to take out an entire high school.

As he's sat down, having dinner, he eyes his girlfriend, grandparents, parents and siblings suspiciously.

He then excuses himself from the table and walks out to his Buick to grab his Glock and a Beretta he bought two weeks ago.

As he walks back inside, ready to gun down his entire family, bright lights suddenly appear in the sky.

Eric looks up and is stunned to see a red giant winged man with long horns hovering above.

""I am Lucifer, Satan's right hand man. Cease your plans, for I know what you think.""

A stunned Eric begins shooting wildly at the red winged giant, terrified and shocked.

The winged giant roars with laughter and bellows, ""You think your bullets have any effect on me?! Not even nukes can harm me!""

""You don't exist! God doesn't even exist! I'm hallucinating!"" Eric screams.

""You are half correct,"" the winged giant says. ""God really doesn't exist. But I do and so does Satan. Together we created this universe and all that dwell in it. God was never here and does not exist in this plane of existence.""",64

A mafia crew is having a closed meeting inside one of its businesses. They're gathered around a large table.,"The caporegime/crew leader looks inbetween all the other gangsters then loudly announces:

""One of youse is a fuckin' rat. We've been having way too many unfortunate ""coincidences"" and the police seem to be one step ahead of us lately. So what we're gonna do is get onna those Rat Terriers in hea to sniff the rat out. Y'know, onna those dogs that are bred to catch rats.""

One of the men cocks an eyebrow and replies:

""Uuh, what? Not for nothin', skip but the word ""rat"" in this particular context is connotative to a snitch. Someone's been ""ratting"" us out. It's an epithet, which means an adjective or phrase expressing a quality or attribute regarded as characteristic of the person or thing mentioned. Get it?""

The caporegime retorts: ""What a fuckin' crock, that doesn't make any sense. Since when has telling on someone been a known characteristic of rats? A rat can not speak either. That's bullshit!""

The man replies: ""Jesus, Carmine. Again, no offense but why in the fuck would the police possessing all this information on us be a result of us havin' an actual rodent in our crew?! You're contradicting yourself!""

The caporegime points his index finger at the man:""You're the rat, aren't you!? Why would you be so apprehensive about bringin' in the dog otherwise? Nicky, bring the mutt in hea already, we're ready!""

The man stares blankly at the caporegime as another gangster walks into the room with a leashed Rat Terrier. The Rat Terrier promptly starts sniffing around the room and reacts as it approaches the table, by lunging at the man.

""Oh, to hell with all this! I'm out!"" The ""man"" yells before the rat jumps out of its human costume.

""I knew it! Get that fuckin' rat!"" The caporegime exclaims. The gangsters all get up from their chairs and chase the rat around, cartoonishly tripping over furniture and bumping into one another.

The rat manages to escape through a crack in the wall. Before it exits the building entirely, the rat turns around and taunts them through the thin wall: ""Haha! How many stupid guineas does it take to catch a rat? More than fifteen, apparently. Also, fuck you, Rat Terrier!""

The rat is brought under witness protection and is now sunbathing on a beach in the Bahamas, 6 months later. The rat's peace of mind is abruptly cut off by a voice emitting from above it.

""How many Rat Terriers does it take to track down and kill a rat?"" Is heard.

The rat is startled and removes its sunglasses, expecting the Rat Terrier to have finally tracked it down ever since hearing rumors of the dog becoming an independent contract killer. Instead the rat sees an old man standing over it.

The old man speaks again: ""Please, I'm so confused. Mine can't catch for shit and there are SO many of them in my house.""

""Get lost, you demented old prick! I'm tryin' to relax ova hea!"" The rat replies in a dismissive manner.

""No, YOU get lost! You're just a goddamn rat, fuck you!"" The old man retorts before he shoots the rat with a snubnosed revolver.",72

A housefly walks into a bar,"and the bartender says, “Why the long face?” To which the housefly responds, “I’m a housefly not a horsefly.” 

It’s at this moment when an old man bursts through the door and frantically runs straight into the restroom. 

The housefly and the bartender look at each other in amazement and continue to stare deep, deep into each other’s eyes. After a minute or two, and halfway through the sad song playing from the jukebox in the corner, he asks the housefly, “I’m sorry, what did you say your name was?” The housefly leans in slowly right up to the bartender’s ear and says, “Your ride is here.” 

The bartender jolts awake in a panic, quickly realizing he is not only not a bartender but rather an adolescent who nodded off briefly in the front entrance of his high school after senior prom during which none of the pretty girls asked him to dance. “Your ride is here,” the principal says once again. 

The young man’s mind is racing, still hazy with remnants of the most bizarre dream he’s ever had. 

He is suddenly overcome with emotion as he notices on the principal’s jacket is a lapel pin in the shape of a housefly. He stands up from the bench upon which he dreamt, his legs wobbly, and asks, “How long had I been dreaming?” The principal again responds, “Your ride is here.” The young man now finds it peculiar that the only words the principal has said are “Your ride is here” and nothing else. 

He gently, but with some force, taps the principal’s shoulder above the fly-shaped pin, realizing now that the principal is just a cardboard cutout with an electric speaker programmed to only say that phrase which he can’t bare to hear again. 

He smashes the false, paper principal and runs into the dark auditorium to find his friends and find out just what the hell is going on. 

To his utter shock, when he opens the heavy double doors to the auditorium he realizes he has just entered a bar. The bartender is talking to the only patron, a housefly. The young man, now an old man, sprints frantically to the bathroom. A sad song plays from the jukebox.",82

"""Looks like this is a bridge over *troubled water*""","God was bored.

Ignoring people's fervent prayers used to be a full-time job but lately it's been lackluster and unfulfilling. Not only are people praying less, but the thing they pray for are the same pleas he's heard for thousands of years. Peace, prosperity and goodwill. Who do they think He is?

Deciding it was time for another jaunt 'downstairs', he once again takes form and goes for a walk in the woods. He listens to the birds, the trees and the rocks, every atom speaking to him in a language only he can understand. As He walks, He comes across a young woman. They fall in step and begin to talk. As they cross a bridge, He says [INSERT TITLE HERE], hoping to impress her with His wit.

The girl looks at Him askance, clearly not getting the reference.

Suddenly afraid of being seen as a dreaded boomer, He stammers and says ""It's, like, all the damage we do to the earth eventually hurts the water, which is what sustains us all. The water loves us but it can't help hurting us, which troubles it.""

The girl decides He's emo, which is only marginally better than being a boomer and begs off.

God fucks her anyways because if you read the Bible you know He doesn't give a Himselfdamned care about consent.

Nine months later, she gives birth to the Anti-Christ.

Nineteen years later, he comes into his power and the destruction of earth begins. Demons flood the earth. Flesh is torn from bodies in a flurry of blood and gore as they have their fill of all the unsaved and the earth burns, and burns, and burns.",70

When asked why he has done this by detectives in China, he simply asks for ""his phonecall"".

Steven Seagal is harassed by seagulls as he approaches a grocery store.,"The seagulls hover in circles above Steven as they taunt him: ""Hah! Nice ponytail, faggot."" ""Going to the store to buy more diapers are we, Steven?""

Steven indignantly retorts: ""The diapers are for my son! Leave me alone, you assholes!""

One of the seagulls laugh and reply: ""Oh, suuure Steven, they're for one of your adult sons. You giant mouthbreathing freak, you're not fooling anyone.""

Another seagull remarks: ""Hey, why don't you tell us all about ""the kick"" that you ""invented"" for Anderson Silva. You pathological liar, you. Haha!""

Steven starts to become enraged and breathes heavily as he stops pacing forwards. He looks up at he seagulls with a sneer on his face and clenched fists.

""Careful now, Steven, before you shit your pants again."" One seagulls yell jeeringly.

""Don't make me come up there you feathery fucking hyenas!"" Steven yells as he stomps and flails his arms around rabidly. His unhinged demeanour attracts a bystander, who approaches Steven who is now foaming at the mouth and pelting the seagulls with rocks.

The bystander asks Steven: ""Sir, are you alright?""

Steven replies: ""These seagulls have been harassing me for several weeks! Call the police!""

""Uhh, okay?"" The bystander says before looking up at the seagulls. The only sounds audible to him are the regular calls of seagulls. ""Wuaah! Wuaah! Wuaah!""

""No! That's just a rumor! I've never sexually assaulted anyone!"" Steven yells back.

""Wuaah! Wuaah!"" Another seagull utters.

Steven replies again: ""Bullshit! It's true! Why would I make something like that up?! I'm friends with the pope as well!""

The bystander pats Steven's shoulder and says hesitantly: ""H-holy shit, okay. Let's calm it down, big guy, huh? Take a deep breath and find your happy place.""

One of the seagulls have managed to attach a piece of black string to the back of its head, mimicking a ponytail. Steven points at the seagull as it struts around on the pavement and yells: ""Look, look! It's making fun of me! I don't sound like that, motherfucker!""

The bystander eventually calls an ambulance and after Steven describes the meticulous harassment and bullying from the seagulls that has spanned several weeks to the EMT's, Steven is admitted for inpatient care at a reknowned mental institution for celebrities and other high profile individuals. A team of experts spend months convincing Steven that he's had a stress induced mental break and has been experiencing auditory hallucinations. He initially denies their claims but after many painstaking hours of treatment, Steven becomes agreeable. He is finally released 6 months later and is greeted by his family outside.

At the first sight of seagulls at the institution's parking lot, Steven becomes nervous, anticipating more verbal abuse, yet all he hears are the normal calls of seagulls. Steven becomes ecstatic and cheers loudly as the treatment has seemingly worked.

""Wuaah! Wuaah! Hahaha! Hear that?! The seagulls aren't talking anymore! Wuaah! Wuaah, indeeed brother!"" Steven gleefully yells as he mimicks their calls. Steven's children become pale-faced and shocked as they slowly back away from Steven.

Steven yells again: ""It's okay, gang! Come here! Listen to them sing! It's beautiful! Wuaah! Wuaah! Wua-..""

Suddenly a bobcat appears from behind a dumpster and yells at Steven: ""wUaH! wUaH! wUaH For the love of god! Shut the fuck up, you retard!""",9

"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times","It was the age of wisdom.

""And that's where Dick ends,"" I say somewhat sadly. I am the narrator, but also part of the conversation.

""I thought that was the beginning?"" she said hopefully.

""No, that's it.""

""But I had such *Great Expectations*!""

We laugh uneasily - it is an acceptable pun, but neither of us have another in mind. We have no way to end the joke. Something with *A Christmas Carol*? We stare into the stale silence. Nothing. We finish our drinks and leave.


The bartender cackles triumphantly. ""Olive, or Twist?"" But the bar is empty. It is the age of foolishness.",4
A human walks into a bar and breathes oxygen,"Suddenly, all the atoms in the bar turn into protons, and the bar which used to consist of half protons and half electrons collapses into itself and becomes a black hole.

Bartender: ""LOL. I never guessed THAT would be the way I go.""

Now you may wonder how is it possible that the bartender even reacted to this event given that all the atoms in his body have just turned into protons. You would be right of course, but actually this sentence was said in the past, in the evening two days before.

What happened then (two days before) was that the another human being had just entered the bar (also one which breathes oxygen). As she approached the bar, she raised her gun, pointed at the bartender and said: 
""Give me all your money, or else I would shoot you in the face!""

What I said the bartender said earlier was his response to this young lady. In fact, he was never quite good in social situations. He did not understand that laughing at people threatening to shoot him was probably not going to end well. Maybe that's why he always used to feel so isolated at school, and which was why he decided to become a bartender in the first place. A vicious cycle indeed. That evening would prove to be his greatest mistake.

On the other hand, there is no absolute concept of time, since time is relative. The gravitational pull of the black hole slows down time near it, so this was only two days in the future from the point of view of a very distant point in the galaxy. Near the bar which has instantly became a black hole, only a moment has passed and both of the bartender and the human being which breathes oxygen instantly become a bunch of protons.

A day later, two nights walk past the bar.

""We need a room for two knights, please""",97
"Hey, girl, are you for Vermont?","- No, I'm not, why?
- Why what?
- You just asked ""Are you from Vermont""?
- No, I'm not, why?
- I wasn't asking you, I was asking you why you asked me.
- Then why did you just say ""Are you from Vermont""?
- No, I'm not, why?
- Why what?

Reality really realizes that they got stuck in a loop, asking each other why they asked the question, so it restarts a version in which the loop can't happen. The girl (who was indeed from Vermont, she was lying) and the man (who was also from Vermont but didn't know it and thought he was from Texas) never existed and never crossed paths. 

The same day, at the same hour, a man passed by that point and for a second felt a chill, like he had stepped on someone's ghost, and thought he had heard some voices arguing endlessly why did you ask that question I'm not from Vermont but you just said no I didn't I was asking why did you ask that question I'm not from Vermont but you just said no I didn't I was asking why did you ask that question I'm not from Vermont but you just said no I didn't I was asking why did you ask that question ...

...and then he shook his head and kept on walking, reaching his house a hundred feet down the street (not below, please notice. There are alligators in the sewers), and he made himself a hot cup of tea and took off his shoes to listen to some music. It is a wonderful life, there in Vermont.",8
A space hotelier is bench pressing in his private 1000 square foot penthouse gym,"""Fuck, I'm fucking aching,"" he huffs, as he puts another 45lbs on the bar, bringing his total to 265lbs. 

He lays back down and starts squeezing out some reps. On his sixth rep, his chest spasms.

""Fuck!"" He cries, as he remembers Carthage and the smells and sights of *that* terrible war.

Seventh rep.

""Fuck!"" He cries, as flashes of the deadly riots in *that* Mesopotamian town stun his mind.

Eighth rep.

""Fuck!"" He cries, as the bloody horrific raids he witnessed in that small African village in 33,091 BC paralyze his mind.

Finally, he is halfway through his ninth and final rep, when a young Marty has somehow found his way into the space hotelier's penthouse gym.

""Xander, the DeLorean's parked up on your helipad. Just try not to get a scratch on it,"" Marty says.

The space hotelier sits up and rubs his sore pecs.

""Where're you comin' from?"" He asks.

""Never mind, that,"" Marty replies, ""Just stay away from 2084, okay? Let's just say, Orwell was out by a few years - or a hundred.""",8
An Arab walks into a bar,"It is said by men worthy of belief (though Allah’s knowledge is greater) that in the first days there was a bartender who called together his architects and his priests and bade them build him a sports bar so confused and so subtle that the most prudent men would not venture to enter it, and those who did would lose their way. Most unseemly was the edifice that resulted, for it is the prerogative of God, not man, to strike confusion and inspire wonder. In time there came to the bar a king of Arabs, and the bartender (to muck the simplicity of his guest) bade him enter the labyrinth, where the king of Arabs wandered, humiliated and confused, until the coming of the evening, when he implored God’s aid and found the door. His lips offered no complaint, though he said to the bartender that in his land he had another labyrinth, and Allah willing, he would see that someday the bartender made its acquaintance. Then he returned to Arabia with his captains and his wardens and he wreaked such havoc upon the sports bar, and with such great blessing by fortune, that he brought low his stools, crushed his pool table, and took the bartender himself captive. He tied him atop a swift-footed camel and led him into the desert. Three days they rode, and then he said to him, “O king of time and substance and cipher of the century! In your sports bar didst thou attempt to make me lose my way in a labyrinth of brass with many stairways, doors, and walls; now the Powerful One has seen fit to allow me to show thee mine, which has no stairways to climb, nor walls to impede thy passage.”

Then he untied the bonds of the bartender and abandoned him in the middle of the desert, where he died of hunger and thirst. This was mostly a short story by Jorge Luis Borges. I changed all mentions of the King of Babylonia to a bartender and of Babylonia to a sports bar to justify a title that would sound like a joke. The rest up until this paragraph is the short story verbatim. Some would even say this isn't an anti-anti-joke (though Allah’s knowledge is greater). Glory to him who does not die.",60

A man doesn't walk into a bar,"""What can I do for you?"" the bartender didn't say, because no one entered the bar.

""Take out one of your finest champagne bottles"" the man didn't say because he didn't walk into the bar.

""There you go"", the bartender didn't say as he didn't take out the bottle.

The man didn't sit down for a while in the bar as he didn't drink any of the champagne, which wasn't possible anyways since the bartender never took it out it in the first place.

""What are we celebrating?"" The bartender did not ask.

The man didn't smile. ""I could tell you but then I would have to kill you.""

That sentence was actually spoken. While the man wasn't walking into the bar and wasn't drinking any champagne, he was actually on his way home, talking on the phone with his wife. His wife was just asking what would the man want for dinner.

""That's a pretty strange response,"" said his wife. ""I think I'll make some pasta then.""

""Sounds good,"" the man didn't say. Instead he said ""sounds great! I would also like it if we drink some champagne tonight"".

""Great!"" Said his wife. ""So you told me what you wanted to have for dinner after all.""

Meanwhile, the bartender was finishing his shift at the bar. Since so many people were busy not walking into the bar, making money was hard and he had to work as a cop for the night shift. His partner was just waiting for him in the police car.

""Hey, come in,"" his partner didn't say. Instead he said ""come in. We have a murder to solve.""",116

A scruffy-looking man wearing a homemade cloth mask walks into a bank,"The security guard, who is wearing a N95 mask, looks over at the man nervously.

Before the man has a chance to reach a teller, the security guard, a man of Japanese-Canadian heritage who once served as crowd control in the Nashville Riots of 2029, panics and presses the panic alarm.

The bank immediately takes off, as per protocol, to the moon. Prior to leaving Earth's atmosphere, another security guard quickly begins handing out spacesuits and oxygen tanks to the customers and tellers, whilst the original security guard subdues the scruffy-looking man on suspicion of planning a robbery, as per the bank's ""two-element protocol"".

As the bank floats in space, enroute to the moon, the bank manager telephones the area manager to inform him that Bank No.79 has evacuated Earth owing to ""a suspected potential robbery"".

The area manager, clearly not pleased, is unhappy and notes that this is the 14th bank to have evacuated in the last week. As a result of such a high number of evacuations, he telephones the FBI to inform them of this latest development. He then proceeds to inform the district manager.

The district manager, who is furious at yet another evacation in progress, informs the regional manager of yet another evacuation.

""You fools!"" The regional manager screams. ""Of course customers are wearing masks - there's a virus going around!""",2

"A sheperd boy runs into the village crying ""Wolf, wolf!""","The villagers immediately cease their activities and rush towards the pasture at the outskirts of their village, where all the sheep are. The boy smirks as the villagers frantically make their way into the pasture only to find that the sheep are all undisturbed, with no wolf in sight, One of the village elders looks back at the boy with a confused expression on his face.

The boy cackles and yells: ""Haha! I can't believe you bozos fell for that again! Wheew! I'm on a roll over here!""

The elderly man, now visibly disgruntled, says to the boy: ""You little prick. A century from now people will still be sharing folk tales of the Boy Who Cried Wolf and the phrase will be an idiom for signalling false emergencies and the dire consequences that follow such behaviour! Mark my words, boy. You'll be a story of foolishness and embarassement that will be forever passed on throughout the annals of history.""

The boy retorts: ""Pfft! That was quite a speech, gramps. We'll see about that.""

The villagers return to their chores and another day passes by. The boy, feeling bored and mischevious, contemplates on alarming the villagers again for his own amusement the next day. Suddenly he hears a great commotion coming from the pasture. The cries of sheep in distress sends shivers down his spine.

""Oh, come on, what are the odds?!"" The boy yells as he runs towards the sheep, that are evidently dispersing in all directions. To his shock, the boy discovers the perpetrator. It's the village baker's autistic nephew going in raw and fully commited on one of the sheep. The sheep cries as it looks directly at the boy, almost as if begging him to save it.

""Oh my god!"" The boy yells before he turns on his heels and runs towards the village.

""Raaaape! Fucking raaape! Raaaape!"" The boy yells at the top of his lungs.

The villagers all stop in their tracks and look at the boy, bewildered. They then all break out in laughter. ""The boy who cried rape, everyone! You've truly outdone yourelf this time, sport!"" The village elder from yesterday's encounter jeeringly shouts at the boy.

""I mean it, come take a look! It's Eugene, the baker's nephew, getting his rocks off with Daisy, my favorite sheep. Please help me save her!"" The boy cries.

The village baker storms out of his  house in anger, yelling: ""You wash that filthy mouth of yours, immediately! You compulsive liar, you! My nephew is no buggerer of sheep, albeit a little..uh touched in the head, sure, but a sheep rapist he is not!!""

Another villager exclaims: ""The boy must be banished from the village! This is outrageous! He's causing too much disharmony in our community!""

The village elder raises his hand and replies: ""You know what? I don't need any more voiced support for such an endevaour. The boy has clearly crossed the line this time! You heard them, boy. Fuck off! Leave this village!""

Legend has it the boy wandered the woods for two seasons , haunted by the stomach turning cries for help from his favorite sheep, in a state of perpetual insomnia. Daisy developed PTSD and became emotionally detached, especially from the other sheep. The village elder tried to shear off her wool one day, when she recoiled, panicked and ran away in response.

The village elder looked at Daisy, in shock. ""Oh no, oh my god! It can't be! The boy was telling the truth all this time! What have we done?!"" He announced.

The baker's nephew, Eugene rushed out of his uncle's house as he unsuccessfully tried to catch two crying and fleeing sheep. He then shouted at the village elder: ""Oh my gooood! Just, oh my goood! Can you just shut up? You startled them when I was about to have a  good time!""

Suddenly a wolf appeared out of nowhere and shouted: ""Rape, rape!""

The village elder replied: ""Rape!? Where!?

The sheperd boy removed his wolf costume, having returned after 6 months of absence and yelled: ""What?! Really?! You'll believe a random fucking wolf yet you wouldn't believe me?!""",20
A man without a vagina walks into a bar,"Minutes later, he finds himself talking to a hot brunette.

""You're really cute,"" the hot brunette says, showing off her slim athletic figure in her short white dress.

""Thanks,"" the man without a vagina says. ""You're sexy yourself.""

""Wanna go back to mine and we can explore each other?"" The hot brunette says, green eyes sparkling.

The man without a vagina hesitates and frowns.

""What's wrong?"" The hot brunette asks.

""Don't you think it'd be weird?"" The man without a vagina says.

""Weird? What would be weird?"" The hot brunette replies.

""Well, I don't have a vagina..."" The man without a vagina murmurs.

"I met a girl at a bar and asked her ""what's your sign?""","""Cancer,"" she said, a tear drop forming in her eye. ""I have a year left to live.""

The next few months were like a whirlwind. I promised her I would make every last moment of her life count. I quit my job, sold my house, car, and everything I owned. We drove across the country in a beat-up 95 Accord.

She grew up near the equator and lived the south. She'd never seen snow before. I took her up north. We saw the Northern Lights. We went down the coast. We got scuba licenses, dove with turtles, had a pet shark. We learned how to surf. We learned tango. We learned how to cook in Thailand. We got married one night in Jamaica. Ran away from the police in Morocco. Spent a week with the mafia in Moscow. Ran a racket for a few days in Tel Aviv. Nearly drowned in Rio.

The sex was fantastic, although some days we got kind of rough, and if a hair fell out, she would shed a single tear before we got back at it. She wanted me to choke her, she wanted to bite me. And after we finished, she would get this twinkle in her eye. She would grin, then purse her lips back, like she was ready to say something but just couldn't get it off her tongue.

She wanted to be a mother. At the 6-month mark we adopted a 17-year old. She always said she wanted someone to know love, someone who had never experienced it in her life. It didn't matter if she couldn't be around, so long as her son knew he would be loved.

We went drinking at the bar we met, right on our one-year aniversary. The doctor advised against it, but we just shrugged. Nothing to lose. She had a double margarita, I had a whiskey on the rocks. Not even two drinks in, she had to go the bathroom. I thought she would never stop vomiting. She looked so weak in that moment, so vulnerable.

Eventually there came a knock at the door. Our time was coming to a close. We picked a peaceful hospice, somewhere with a nice ocean view. I held her hand on the last day. She got a twinkle in her eye, grinned, and then pursed her lips back, like she was ready to say something but just couldn't get it off her tongue. She weakly gestured at me and I leaned in close. She pulled over to my ear and whispered her last words:

""Dead end.""",195

""But...slowness...and caution-"" The turtle began.

The dalmatian then trotted off happily, dozens of awestruck smitten kittens trailing behind.

Years later, the dalmatian had quickly and magically evolved into a dashing young astronaut with long golden hair and a sharp nose. He was now leading his 95th deep space expedition and had already quickly colonized 49 habitable extrasolar planets in 39 different star systems.

Steve, being the man in the title and not an unrelated third person, offers back a sigh. ""I'm sorry, Bob. I was really excited about getting to Happy Hour for the discounted drinks, because inebriation is an enjoyable state when pursued in moderation, but according to my watch I'm about to miss the sale!""

Bob raises his eyebrows, by flexing his forehead muscles like a normal person would. ""Happy hour is almost over? Holy Pope On A Stick, Steve. Why didn't you say so earlier?"" he asks, knowing full well that Steve had not had a chance to speak to him prior to when he did, because Bob loves pointed rhetorical questions.

""Well, Bob, you're welcome to join me,"" Steve offers, mentally wounded from the rhetorical jab at his communication skills. Bob responds with a shrug and holds Steve's hand. They're not lovers, but they're not afraid of holding hands, either. Together, they walk to the bar in question.

"The shadow of a horse struts into a bar. The barman says ""why the long face?""","""Do you know what it means to be a shadow without a body?"" asks the shadow, by way of an answer. ""I have no *purpose in life*"".

""I'm afraid I don't know what it means to be a shadow without a body,"" replies the bartender, shaking his head modestly, ""but here's your *porpoise wife*"".

Looking down at the glistening porpoise breathing heavily 'pon the bar top, the horse shadow realises that the bartender must have misheard, since ""purpose in life"" and ""porpoise wife"" are such superficially similar phrases. As he continues to stare into the porpoise's tender eyes, however, his heart begins to stir uncomfortably, until finally, compelled by the hot vertigo of love, he mounts the counter and invites the porpoise into an act of furious congress--sweet and succulent--parting her burning porp' loins like an Olympic diver parts the glassy water of the splash pool. The dark vacuum inside him becomes suddenly replete with joyful motion and the feeling that, even in life's shadow, there is inexpressible beauty and significance to be found.

When at last the fog of lust clears, however, the horse is surprised how quickly the feelings of aimlessness and inadequacy begin to return, and he realises that any meaning derived from the love between a shadow and a porpoise is ultimately immaterial to the ambivalence of the void.

Dejected, he climbs down from the bar and takes several steps towards the audience. The stage lights falter, causing the audience to gasp and briefly plunging the theatre into darkness. When the lights return, the shadow of the horse is gone.

The fact that the guy was black probably had nothing to do with it and you shouldn’t assume that just because I said that she’s a racist means she judges people based on race. Even if it’s true that’s just one variable about her. How are you going to jump to conclusions like that? Now who’s prejudiced? Well maybe she can’t help it and it was just her upbringing and now she’s trying to compensate for it by getting to love and respect members of the another race. Perhaps that’s just a very bad false rumor... maybe she’s not racist at all. You just assumed she was racist because I told you? And then you assumed that a black guy wouldn’t marry a racist gal unless it was a joke? That seems kind of prejudiced to me. Now who’s the racist? 

Perhaps if we all tried to see the good in people and suspend beliefs and assumptions and statements made by others, we could learn for language and our cultural differences not to divide us but to make each other stronger.

He says: ""When you're all done with this little circle jerk of yours, I'll have you know that you were the ones being reckless by absentmindedly walking into my path. In fact, I'll bet one of you little shits put a dent in my car so you better have those insurance details ready.""

The mother duck replies: ""You hear that, kids? Which one of you are carrying the papers with the insurance information?"" A duckling says in return: ""I got this, mother. Here they are."" The duckling says while extending one of its wings towards the mother duck.

The mother duck says: ""Wait. There's nothing there though, you're holding onto nothing. What gives?""

The duckling replies: ""Oh no! Do you think it's because we're FUCKING DUCKS WITHOUT OPPOSABLE THUMBS OR FINGERS AND WITH NO HUMAN IDENTITIES, HENCE WE HAVE NO WAY OF PARTICIPATING IN HUMAN SOCIETY, WITH ITS BUREAUCRACY AND FORMALITIES!?""

""No way! Never in a million years would I have thought of that being a factor, never! You've blown my goddamn mind! Who would've thought that they don't give insurance to ducks?!"" The mother duck says jeeringly. The duckling replies: ""Well, holy shit! Clearly this mouthbreathing PhD behind the wheel knew that already! What a genius!""

The man loses his temper and yells emotionally, with a single tear forming in his eye: ""You guys are complete assholes! Nevermind this!"" He starts to drive off while wiping his eyes.

The mother duck yells: ""Wooooow! What a champion! Get a load of this man-child just driving off after murdering my children. Class act!"" The man yells out of the open window: ""Shut up! Shut the hell up!"" He accelerates faster while continuing to wipe tears away from his face, which results in him swerving off the road and crashing into a tree.

The ducks run up to the wrecked car. The mother duck yells: ""Oh no! Are you okay? How is it even possible when you're the best driver I've ever witnessed? Hold on, I'm calling for an ambulance! Beep, beep, beep! Hello? This is 911? Yes, I'm at the scene of a car accident. You're going to need two ambulances because me and my entire family are in shock and disbelief that such a skillful driver would fail so miserably!"" The mother duck says while pretending to use a cellphone.

One of the ducklings remarks: ""But, mother?! You are a duck? How could you possibly possess a phone?!"" The mother duck feigns suprise and says: ""Oh my god! You are absolutely correct! What was I thinking?! Edoiiii! I'm so silly today.""

The man slowly starts to succumb to his wounds as his final moment is accompanied by an increasingly distant ambiance of ducks quacking in mocking tones. The man realises that they're not speaking a human language any longer. Did the entire scenario play out in his head? Is anything even real? Is life just a dream?

The man is about to die as one of the ducklings hop into the vehicle and says to him: ""Scoot over, moron. I've always wanted to test drive one of these. The man's last words are: ""How can you even drive when you're a duck?""

Before he draws his final breath the duckling says: ""It's okay, they've already registered and made an exception for me at the DMV.""",10

Later that day, 49,000 Americans from across 50 states are gathered near Sloan Canyon National Conservation Area near Henderson, Nevada. Hundreds of cops, state troopers and military personnel swarm around the thousands of people, attempting to regain order amidst the chaos.

"Helvetica and times new roman walk into a bar ""Get out of here "" Shouts the bartender ""we don't serve your type "" !!! hahhahahaha",,2
"A try-hard, rebellious contrarian walks into a bar.","He orders a beer and looks up at a TV currently showing a news broadcast. The female news anchor ends a segment with stating: ""Health authorities stress that you must maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from other people, sneeze into your armpit or a tissue and don't forget to wash your hands."" After listing other preventive measures regarding the Corona pandemic.

The contrarian sneers upon hearing her words and loudly proclaims within the audible range of the few other intoxicated people inside: ""How about no, you mainstream media, corporate whore!?  I will do no such thing! HAH! In fact, watch me do the opposite of everything you just said!"" The man runs his hands along the bar counter, starting from one side to the opposite end. He then touches as many surfaces as possible as he heads towards the restroom, stopping momentarily to caress a drunk man's head as well sticking his fingers inside the drunk man's mouth, who just stares at the contrarian with vacant and glassy eyes.

""What the fuck just happened?"" The drunk man exclaims as the contrarian eagerly sprints into the restoom, urinates and rushes out without washing his hands while running his hands across his own face. The contrarian proceeds by faking a series of sneezes within 6 feet of some of the other drunk patrons of the bar as he dramatically circles the premises. ""Atchoo! Atchoo! Prrr!"" He yells in a contrived manner while ejecting droplets of saliva all over the establishment. He eventiually stops in front of a sign depicting the words""NO SMOKING""

""Fuck you, noone tells me what to do!"" The contrarian yells before aligning numerous cigarettes along his mouth and lights them all at once. He dramatically inhales and exhales as much as much smoke he can before the bartender angrily approaches him.

""What the fuck is wrong with you? Get out of here, you clown!"" The bartender demands. ""Noone tells me what to d-.."" is all what the contrarian manages to say in return before he's grabbed by the shoulders and forced outside by the bartender. The contrarian flips off the bartender, who just waves him off dismissively in return. ""Whatever, your bar is s dive anyway!"" The contrarian yells before leaving for the hotel he's currently staying in. He steps on a patch of grass which contains a sign which reads ""Do not step on the grass"" before finally arriving at his hotel.

He enters the lift in order to get to his room after passing through the lobby. He notices a sign reading ""Do not jump inside the elevator."" He becomes enraged and immediately starts to violently jump up and down. ""Yeah, take that! Fuck your demands, society!"" Unfortunately for the contrarian, the elevator has become borderline derelict as no mainteance work has been done for quite some time. He plummets to his death as the elevator's cables finally give in and are ripped apart , the elevator having been situated at one of the upper floors before breaking.

The contrarian now finds himself standing in front of the heavenly gates, where an illuminating and featureless being of light starts to address him: ""Welcome, child. You may enter through these gates.""

The contrarian scoffs at the disembodied being and replies: ""I don't need your permission or some sort of green light to do anything! You may stop giving me directions!"" The being becomes speechless for a few seconds before retorting: ""Are you absolutely retarded? You were only \*this\* close to making it here to begin with. I'll have you know that you just transmitted a disease to 6 people at a bar, aside from being an insufferable prick generally. You also pelted some ducks at a park with rocks a month ago, despite a sign telling you not to. You didn't know you were infected, thus you were not judged and punished accordingly. Consider yourself lucky and show some appreciation as you enter through these gates.""

The contrarian yells: ""No! I will do the complete opposite of that and be fully unappreciative and consider myself privileged to do so..wait, in fact, I'm not even going to enter at all! HAH! So, get fucked!"" The being says, seemingly taken aback: ""You..wow, you really don't want to die on this hill, you stubborn child, you."" The contrarian replies, with a grin on his face: ""Oh, but I do! Watch me do it now, jackass!""

The light being sighs before sending the contrarian to hell instead.

Why can't mute people speak?,Asked the mute man to the deaf man. The deaf man didn't hear him because he wasn't paying attention.,15
The first time i lied to my dad,"Is the only time i lied to him. Ever. Because he is a person that values honesty. So when i told him a lie he said to me - ""Son. I know you told me a lie. Don't ever lie to me again, because i value honesty."" So anytime i want to tell him a lie now i instead tell him an honesty.

My father accepts honesties. He rewards me for being honest. For example, when i say something honest, he says - ""Son, i'm very proud of you for telling me this honesty, so i reward you now, thank you.""

My mother once caught us in the middle of the reward ceremony. ""What is this ceremony!"" she proclaimed vigorously. My dad honestly replied ""I give son reward for telling me honesty!"" Mom said - ""Honey he's a liar, he tricked you into believing that he was honest, but in reality he was lying."" Father was heartbroken, he screamed - ""Liar!"" and went back into his room. I told mom - ""Why did you have to stop ceremony? I like reward ceremonies."" But mom replied - ""Son, your dad is an idiot, honesty doesn't get you anywhere in this world. Look at me, i married your father, achieved everything in my life through lies, and in comparison your father was tricked into marriage by me and all he ever got from anyone is lies. Look, i lied to him that you lied to him and he started crying in his room. He is a loser, don't be like him. Start lying, my boy.""

And so i started lying. I mostly lied to my dad but also to my mom sometimes. I lied to my dad about telling him honesties. He would always smile when i told him an ""honesty"" and really thought it were real honesties, i was not a little kid anymore so my lies were of higher quality than those which i could produce when i was younger. He had his suspicions but he always chose to buy the ""honesties"" because that saved his emotional state. My mom always knew when i told her lies because she was a better liar, but she always rewarded me for trying so that i have stimuli to lie more. Once i tried telling her an honesty and she screamed at me so loud that dad ran to us asking ""Why are you shouting at our son?"" She told him that i was telling lies so father said ""I'm very disappointed in you, no reward ceremonies for you for the entire month!"" I was very upset about it and learned that it was best to keep lying to satisfy both mom and dad.

Sometime later, when i was getting older, my dad decided that he was dying, and he was honest about it - he said ""Son, wife, i'm going to die."" I told him ""I'm very sorry dad, i will miss you."" It was an ""honesty"". I was very sad that it couldn't be an honesty, but after telling him ""honesties"" for so many years i couldn't just break this habit and disappoint both mom and dad again. My dad said that he is proud to have raised such an honest son. Then he died. My mother then said ""Son, i'm going to die as well."" Then i didn't know how to reply, it suddenly was so complicated. Obviously, it was a lie, but what kind of lie should i tell her? But before i could come up with a reply, she continued - ""Your father is dead."" ""No he isn't!"" i told her! ""You are going to be dead too!"" - ""Yes i am!""

This conversation continued in this manner until mom died. ""So wait, she didn't lie?""

Obviously she lied about being a liar.

Now i'm worried if i'm going to die or not.",4

The crew circle the man as he walks and speaks while facing the camera: ""Every year Americans suffer strokes caused by a multitude of reasons. Some of alcoholism, some after suffering head trauma, some, just like this man, have suffered both. As you can tell, all the typical signs are being exhibited by this individual.

Again, take note of the complete nonsense and lack of coherency uttered by this gentleman. Should we get you an ambulance, sir?""

The Maisonette,"There was a bar in the basement of a petite maisonette in the middle of nowhere. Nobody walked into the bar, because there wasn't anybody, nobody walked out of the bar, because the doors were locked. In the bar the guests were killed, one after the other; they couldn't escape. A lightbulb had to be changed. How many viruses does it take to change a lightbulb?",2
"Thousands of years ago, a man known as Jesus Christ is standing in a large open square, preaching to thousands","Surrounded by thousands of poor, weary, sick and needy people, the long-haired Semite is telling the thousands gathered before him how much God loves them all and how He will provide food for them and heal their illnesses and provide comfort to them.

Suddenly, a large powerfully built warrior, a dark-skinned man from the southern lands beyond Jerusalem laughs out loudly. 

Everybody turns around stunned. 

Jesus Christ stops talking and frowns, shocked given that he has never been interrupted before.

The tall black warrior roars again in laughter, his powerful thick arms resting proudly on his waist.

""Rubbish!"" He bellows proudly, his loud voice reaching the thousands gathered in the whole square. 

The people around him move back slightly and turn to look at him. Everybody's attention is drawn away from a confused and frowning Jesus Christ.

""Rubbish! Why listen to this stupid woman?! Why listen to this transgender woman?!"" He bellows loudly.

At that point, Jesus Christ blushes and stares at the warrior with angry, stern eyes. 

An almighty scream is then heard in the sky above the crowd and a bright light, brighter even than the sun in the sky, explodes in the sky above. A gigantic blond long-haired warrior, easily three times the size of even the greatest warrior, clad in glistening gold armor and flying with large long white wings, appears in the sky, glorious and transcendent.

With angry red eyes, he unsheaths a large long sword, temporarily blinding the entire crowd.

""You!"" He screams at the powerful black warrior standing below. His voice can be heard for miles; it is like the sound of booming thunder, deafening, terrifying and ferocious. ""You dare to disrespect the Son of God?! You - a mere mortal?!""

The warrior stares up, terrified and speechless.

Jesus, now visibly calm with no frown, smiles.

The powerful winged blond angel swoops down and lunges at the warrior.

""For your pride and rudeness, mortal, you will now be shrunk down and made to wander this Earth for four thousand generations! You will see the people you love die and will always be alone. When your fellow mortals go to the stars in the future and see the wonders of God and His creation, you will be left to rot on this rock forever! Thus I have spoken! Now be gone!""

With that, the black warrior begins to shrink visibly before everybody. His powerful thick arms and legs shrink and become thin and bony. His large curly hair becomes lifeless and small. His beard disappears. His powerful aesthetic face shrinks into a puffy unsightly ugliness. He is now a head and a half shorter than before and resembles a thin young boy. 

The crowds laughs, stunned and in awe.

Jesus Christ grins and calms the crowd.

The former powerful warrior, with sad and terrified eyes, scurries away from the square, ashamed and frightened.

Jesus grins at the crowd.

""I am Jesus Christ and I am the son of God.""",94

An eccentric 19th century German philosopher walks into a bar.,"""It's him again. Save us oh God."" utters the bartender.  
""Which God are you calling to,"" asks the philosopher, ""have you not heard that he is dead?""  
""No...""  
""OH YES! And, most extraordinarily, WE have killed him."" Shouts the philosopher.  
""What do you mean? Like, you and me, and the bartender over there?"" another customer next to him asks.  
""No, no. Us - the human race."" replies the philosopher.  
""Ah. But how could we...""  
""Drink up the sea?""  
""No, I-""  
""Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon? What were we doing when we unchained this earth from its sun? Whither is it moving now? Whither are we moving? Away from all suns? Are we not plunging continually? Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there still any up or down? Are we not straying, as through an infinite nothing? Do we not feel the breath of empty space? Has it not become colder? Is not night continually closing in on us? Do we not need to light lanterns in the morning? Do we hear nothing as yet of the noise of the gravediggers who are burying God? Do we smell nothing as yet of the divine decomposition? Gods, too, decompose. God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him.”

""Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?"" the philosopher finishes. ""Did you like it?"" he asks the bartender.  
The bartender, half-asleep, replies, ""Yes, yes. Very interesting. Now, what was your name again?""  
""Friedrich Nietzs-""  
""Friedrich, look. My boss is going to come back in a few minutes and if he sees you still here without a drink on the table he's going to get mad at me. So I'm going to ask you one more time, either order something or get out of this bar!""  
""Fine, I'll have a glass of milk.""  
""What?!""  
""I'll have an ellipsis"" says another customer.
""A what?""
""An ""ellipsis"", a narrative device used to condense time in a story.""
""Ah, okay.""

A couple of hours later:
""Man, can you believe this guy? He was asking for milk, in a goddamn bar, Jeff"" the bartender tells his friend.  
""Who was he?"" Jeff asks.  
""Friedrich...something. Nitch might've been.""the bartender replies  
""Has the name of an oddball for sure.""   
""He was rambling something about God being dead and stuff.""  
""Was he one of them Jehova's witnesses?""  
""No, I think he might've been one of my many hallucinations.""
""What are you on about?""
""I think my whole life is a dream Jeff. I don't know how to explain it""
""Well try, goddamnit.""
The bartender moves suddenly and strongly grabs Jeff's neck as he kisses him thoroughly and with extreme passion. ""I am madly in love with you, Jeff. I have been ever since you stepped into this bar the very first time.""
""Wow, do you really mean it?""
""No! This is not me, you see. I am being controlled!""

"Clarke Brent, a young and energetic UCLA undrgrad had just won the Powerball in Ohio and is about to hold a press conference","The lottery organizers have invited the young Mr Brent to answer a few questions from the media regarding his $611m Powerball win.

As Mr Brent stands in the lobby, in his bright green Nikey T-shirt and cheap straight fit Walmart jeans and black sneakers, he begins to sweat nervously, aware that millions of Americans and random people around the world will be watching him on television soon.

He hears the woman from the Ohio Lottery begin to announce his name and tell the media of the night he bought his six Powerball tickets whilst out with friends.

At that moment, he hears a commotion and shouting and screams.

""FBI!"" A masculine authoritative voice bellows. ""Nobody move!""

Suddenly, 7 Federal agents burst into the lobby where Mr Brent is waiting to enter the press conference.

""Clarke Brent?"" A 6 foot 6 well-built black Federal agent narrows his eyes at him, whilst quickly flashing his badge. ""FBI. You need to come with us - now!""

Mr Brent's eyes widen.

""God! I've done nothing wrong. What's going on?""

At that moment, the woman from the Ohio Lottery wanders into the lobby, pale-faced and terrified.

Mr Brent stares at her and doesn't know what to think.

At that moment, there is more commotion and screaming in the press conference room and someone bellows ""Cleveland PD!""

Confusion descends as 13 Cleveland PD officers burst into the lobby, hands on holsters, stern looks on their faces, powerful torsos sucking in air.

""What's going on here?!"" A squat, barrel-bodied officer bellows at the FBI agents.

The 6 foot 6 black agent snaps back at him. ""Federal jurisdiction. This doesn't concern you. This is FBI business and this man here is coming with us.""

Another Cleveland PD officer steps forward, weapon unholstered, fingers near his firearm. ""Now hold on just a sec-""

Another loud commotion is heard in the press conference room and everybody in the lobby turns around in shock.

11 well-built men in smart black suits march in, earpieces in ears.

""Secret Service. Clarke Brent? We're gonna need you to come with us.""

At tha moment, the raised voices of the FBI agents, the Cleveland cops and the Secret Service agents clamour over each other and a loud argument is breaking out.

At that exact point, a small bomb explodes inside the Ohio Lottery Commission building and gunfire erupts, as women in bulletproof vests and long black overcoats start shooting at the cops and Federal agents and the Secret Service personnel. Screams, blood, terror and bullets flying.

Clarke Brent is absolutely terrified. Amidst the gunfire, bodies flying and bullets, he quickly pulls out his blue Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra smartphone and pulls up his ""Rewind app"". He clicks ""Rewind"" and presses ""Play"" at the ""1995"" slot.

Immediately the Cleveland Cops disappear, the FBI agents disappear, the woman from the Ohio Lottery disappears, the Secret Service agents disappear, the female militants disappear, the Ohio Lottery Commission building disappears and Clarke Brent is left standing in an endless white room with no ceiling, no walls and no end in sight.

Suddenly, a small thin African man walks in, white-suited and wearing sunglasses, skin as black as night. 

He begins speaking in perfect English, a posh polished New Yorker drawl.

""Clarke - Are you sure you want to go back to 1995, back to the day you were born?""

Mr Brent stares back at him, bewildered. 
He shakes his sadly. 

""No, Nero Godman. Take me back to before I was born. Take me back to the beginning of he universe.""

Nero Godman, the small African man, frowns back at him.

""Are you sure, Clarke? You do realize that you will not exist? This will be the end for you, for your corporeal form. Clarke Brent, as you are now, will cease to exist.""

Mr Brent blinks. ""Do it. I'm done.""

Clarke Brent, the UCLA undergrad who won the $611m Powerball in Ohio in 2022, blinks out of existence.",2

A blonde moves from Massachusetts to Vermont,"""Do you know that both states are statistcally more intelligent now?"", asks the blonde her new neighbor, an old Vermonter, ""And statistics don't lie.""

The Vermonter answers:  ""I once made a random set of composite numbers by randomly chosing two numbers and multiplying them. Then I made a statistic and observed, that only one quarter of all random composite numbers are odd. If half of all number are odd and only a quarter of the composite numbers, then two thirds of the odd numbers aren't composited, so they have to be prime. Therefore two thirds of the odd numbers and one third of all numbers are prime. Statistics don't lie my ass!""",1
A mass shooting has taken place,"**A man wearing a self-designed Delta Air Lines T-Shirt has shot 7 people dead and injured 42.**

Airline giant, Delta Air Lines, has today distanced itself from Todd Ihavahoe, after a mass shooting took place today in the sleepy city of Saint George, UT, killing 7 and injuring 42. 

The shooter, identified by police as 48 year old Todd Ihavahoe, was allegedly wearing a self-designed T-Shirt with the Delta Air Lines logo and name emblazoned on the front. All the victims were wearing self-designed ""I am Harry S Truman"" T-shirts with an image of former President Truman printed on the front with ""Harry S Truman"" printed underneath. 

Lawyers for the Truman family are reportedly preparing to bring lawsuits against all the victims and their families. Clifton Truman Daniel, one of President Truman's grandchildren, has said he has no knowledge of any lawyers bringing lawsuits on behalf of his family and has sent his condolences to the victims and families of the shooting.

Laura Ivanhoe, a second cousin of the shooter, told NBC this morning that she was related to the shooter, Todd Ihavahoe and that he had reportedly changed his name from ""Thomas Jefferson Ivanhoe Washington"" to ""Todd Ihavahoe"" last year after winning $5million on the Mega Millions with a ""Megaplier"" ticket. The Megaplier is an optional add-on feature on a Mega Millions lottery ticket. When players choose to add this option to their ticket they potentially increase their non-jackpot winnings by 2, 3, 4, or 5 times, depending on the Megaplier randomly selected for that draw.

Conor approaches an elderly man at the bar and speaks to him: ""You there! How would you like a glass of Proper No. Twelve instead of whatever garbage yer drinkin?""

The elderly man sighs, before he replies: ""I'm going t'level with ye, Conor. First of all, yer very rude comin' in 'ere and mouthen off like that. Second, I'd rather mix some brake fluid with rat shit, call it Proper No. Arse and let me grandchild drenk it. Yer a decent fighter, Conor, but a whiksy connoisseur yer not. Don't ked yerself.""

""Bastard! You take that back! Me whisky is critically acclaimed!"" Conor retorts.

Conor loses his temper and punches the old man in the head, the man barely reacts and just keeps sipping his drink before remarking: ""Did a lehttle ketten just land on me noggin'?

The man examines the slight bump on the side of the old man's head, then asks him: ""Ah, Conor was in 'ere again, wasn't he?""

They eventually stop and one of them says: ""There! Now you'll know better than getting cheeky with the master again! Let's feck off, lads! He's learned his lesson!""

A Man Walks in to A Bar," A man walks in to a bar.

The barman says ""knock knock"".

""who's there?"" say's the man. He stands and observes the drab, middle-of-the-road interior. A buzzing strip light, cold tilled walls, a crummy counter and a small fly buzzing lazily around the million mile stare adorning the vacant expression of the patron. A man appearing as though he may have always been here, in some manner, among the nameless night shrouded rain wet street, nestled between the sound of traffic breezing by and a cat knocking over a bottle somewhere in the middle distance.

""We got a ones sevens special one ninety nine"" says the barman, his eye's flickering for an instant to the present before sinking back into a greyish haze somewhere deep in the recesses of his mind. 

""I'll have a kabosh special"" say's the door, ""extra fries and drink one ninety nine"". The barman glances for a moment at the long face of the man before concluding that he must be a little horse. He turns to procure his request.

The bottle rolls into the rain and breaks on the cat's curiosity. The sound rings out and the fly knocks the door.

""Why the long face?"" say's the horse.

The light, having observed this whole circus from it's relative position of illumination, has had enough and makes a leap for the door, casting an incandescent glow across the drab interior. 

The man watches the patron glow under new hues as he shaves thin slices of time from the rotary spit, etching each cascading unfurl of creation across the vistas of space between totality and the warm bready base. Chips and a drink one ninety nine.

&#x200B;

A shadow of the man is formed on the wall by the light's escaping draw which in a moment of narrative convenience is stricken by a phase of conscious prescience. Allowing him, it, momentarily, to contend with this seemingly surreptitious subversion of logical conformity. It reminds him, it, of the lady in the old greasy spoons. The gold-yellow neon glow and the smell of fried onions as the star collapsed. He was forever on that horizon at escape velocity, watching the twisting nebulae of time and space sink pressingly toward entropic equilibrium.

He remembers falling in forever, he remembers escaping, that light speed moment that was forever and no time at all. He cannot recall being able to separate these sensations and is unnerved by the profound implications of this equivalence.

He remembers, though, the lonely aeons and vast distances occurring in an instant massless paradox, before reaching the door.

""Knock knock"".

""Who's there?"" Say's the man.

He's waiting for his order, observing calmly the thin slices of time fall toward the soft bready warmness in the restful palm of the barman's million-mile stare. A stare that speaks to one's impression that this barman has been around forever. ""Have I been around forever"" he thinks as he turn's towards the door.

""Who's there?"" Says the man.

""A little horse"" Says the Shadow. He observes the drab middle-of-the-road interior cast in iridescence by the light's escaping draw and ponders whether he really ever escaped. Whether all this, him; a locality of lesser cascade, a shadow, really exists at all, or is merely some perfunctory realization of an anthropomorphic personification within the mind of man. Whether the nature of subjectivity at all is truly any different from his momentary space-time construction. Or at least whether he really deserves to be called alive as some physical construct between definite points in time and space, light and dark. Shadow. A shadow of a man waiting for his order. The star collapses.

""Why the long face?"" Say's the man, rhetorically, as he reaches for the door handle. ""I'm sorry, I'm a little hor...""

The cat's bottle shatters as it falls inexorably toward the middle. It watches the breath-taking unfurl of creation play out in asymptotic fatality without and within. It is both dead and alive.

The shadow on the wall watches the barman shave little slices of time from the rotary that fall through space toward the warm bready base within the barman's comforting palm, ""ones sevens kabosh"" say's the barman ""chips and drink ninety nine extra"". He turns toward the man, palm outstretch. A ones sevens kabosh in hand.

The palm reaches the light and the man is in Shadow. A million aeons fall as rain upon the traffic flowing gently through that nameless street and a tear falls from his eye. He remembers the aeons, the vast distance, the loneliness and the warm embrace of the barman's comforting palm.

He remembers the iridescent glow of the light as it makes for the door and the tear falls toward the event horizon, cast in gold-yellow hues. He remembers falling in forever, he remembers escaping, he cannot recall being able to separate these sensations and is at once consumed by the existential terror at the profound implications of this moment. Is he the tear, is he the shadow, or is he the man? He cannot separate these sensations and is at once comforted by the soft draw of light casting gold yellow hues across the gentle rain on this nameless street.  


The tear hangs before him, within and without, as they fall. He stares a million-mile stare as the tear's iridescent glow, caught in the light's escaping draw, shines infinite hues of gold en yellow.  


Until, at the last, after aeons of loneliness and vast unimaginable distances, he reaches the door.

Advanced Technology Machines Are Empowering & Spreading The NCOV COVID19 Faster,"**Advanced Technology Machines Are Empowering & Spreading The NCOV COVID19 Faster**

***From:*** [***https://theworld.data.blog/2020/02/25/advanced-technology-machines-are-empowering-spreading-the-ncov-covid19-faster/***](https://theworld.data.blog/2020/02/25/advanced-technology-machines-are-empowering-spreading-the-ncov-covid19-faster/)

I am not speculating or guessing, I am  using the feeling immortals sense and giving you guys the truth of this  epidemic event so you guys can prevent it.

Science cannot measure Nature, that is for sure. The smaller entity cannot judge the bigger one.

**Can you answer the following questions about the NCOV COVID19:**

1. What is the source and the birth of the virus?

2. Why the virus are spreading so fast?

3. But why some nations spreading fast, why some nations are not?

My statement still do not change, the  advanced technology especially the 5G network are empowering the NCOV  and have a huge contribution into the birth of this virus.

The only reason explain why some nations  next to China like Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia but do not get that virus  spreading fast is they are “out-date” technology. Why the farer nations  with advanced technology are record many more cases everyday.

**In Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos:** There are no high-end trains, no commercial 5G network, no fingerprint/face regconical at border airport.

**What about China, Korea, Singapore, Japan?** Too many public advanced technology sharing devices like bullet train, 5G network, fingerprint biometrics, etc.

I remind all of you that, there are 70%  SARS in the NCOV COVID19, which mean air condition will only help  spreading the virus, including public trains, airport.

I highly recommend all the so call  scientist do the experiment about the connection of the NCOV COVID19  with the 4G, 5G network and the electric devices.

They can put the NCOV COVID19 in the  environment with 5G, 4G, 3G, 2G, and none and observe the virus  everyday, and they will receive the answer whether or not there is a  huge connection with mobile network with the NCOV COVID19.

They should try to put that virus and find  out what surface what objects the NCOV “love”: technology devices,  cloth, sand/clay, etc.

Many nations are not using common feeling sense but rely on broken technology and digging their own grave.

I have made predictions about the collapse of advanced technology nation at least 1-2 years ago, then now it become reality.

If the China, Korea, Japan, Singapore,  Israel, etc. do not stop all the 4G, 5G network, air condition on public  train and stop the fingerprint/biometrics collection on border then  they will all gone within the next 60 days for sure.

**If you cannot prove my statement are wrong, then it must be true.**

**Stop asking me about tiny science  proof evidence for science cannot record many things, including the  super small seed of the NCOV COVID19 !!!**

Best Regard,

A little red hen went out into the fields.,"""Will you help me gather some wheat?"" asked the hen.

""Sorry, maybe some other time,"" said the pig.

After the hen had picked her wheat, she strolled over to the mill. ""Will you help me mill this wheat into flour?""

""My hands are full,"" said the cow. ""Can you hand me that wrench?""

Once the hen had milled the wheat, she fetched a few other ingredients, and began to make the dough. ""Will you help me knead this dough?""

""Can't you see I'm busy?"" said the fox, not looking away from the periscope. ""Make yourself useful!""

After kneading the dough the hen fetched some logs for the oven. ""Will you help me bake this dough into bread?""

The three hundred ton xenocetacean was intrigued but said nothing, since it had no concept of fire.

After a short while, the hen removed a golden brown loaf of bread from the oven. Steam filled the small cabin, and a mouthwatering aroma overpowered the smell of rust and salt.

""Now,"" clucked the little red hen. ""Who will help me eat this bread?""

""I want some!"" squealed the pig.

""Me too!"" chimed in the cow.

""Save some for me!"" said the fox.

The three hundred ton xenocetacean sounded a 190 decibel screech which echoed through the steel hull. Astrobiologists would later translate this vocalization to ""Thanks, but I'm sensitive to gluten.""

Earlier that day the hen was looking forward to hoarding the bread for herself. But as Europa's frigid water rose to ankle level around their feet, the virtue of charity took hold of her little chicken heart, and she cut a slice for all of her seamates. The four ate in silence, listening only to the sound of groaning metal and rushing water, savoring every last morsel. They all knew that the revolver sitting in the center of the table had only three bullets, but nobody wanted to be the first to reach for it.

Just before the water touched her beak, the little red hen awoke from the nightmare, drenched in sweat and gasping for air.

""That vile fox! He used all three bullets on himself!""

He discovers a washed-out, deteriorated, middle-aged woman that has passed out on the floor of the male restroom, with a lit cigarette dangling from the corner of her mouth and laying in a pool of her own puke. The man coyly smirks and unzips his pants before he lowers himself towards her.

""And that, kids, is how I met your mother."" Bob Saget tells his children, now situated in the living room of his own house, many years later.

His children stare at him in silence for roughly ten seconds, one of them remarks: ""You're a very sick and obscene man, father.""

Bob Saget's smirk, which he has maintained continually for over 10 years, even in his sleep, suddenly dies. He replies: ""I bet you don't have the balls to say that to me again...kid.""

The child leans forwards and looks Bob Saget straight into his eyes. The tension in the room could be cut with a knife. The other children watch, nervously. The child says ""No? Then observe and listen to me say it again, you depraved old man. Ready? You. are. a. very. sick. and. obscene. man. father. Also your comedy has always been subpa-..""

Suddenly Bob Saget jumps out of his seat vigorously and roundhouse kicks the male child in the head. The Olsen twins immediately try to protect their brother and jump Bob Saget.

“I like my women how I like my teddy bears.”,"Charles waited for the punchline, but the punctuation indicated there was none. “Fyodor. Finish the joke.” Alex demanded, pushing Fyodor to the ground. But Fyodor couldn’t, his friend was dead. They looked over at Charles, who had died of Alzheimer’s three years ago. Alex stares at him, his hands shaking as he grabbed the teddy bear from his side. 

Fyodor, the lawyer, put his hand on Alex’s back and watched the teddy bear with him. The sudden force plunged Alex forwards and onto Charles’ corpse. “You’re going to prison, and it will not be nice.” Alex yelled, the teddy bear was now in Fyodor’s hands. “Great, I’m not compatible with this teddy bear anyways. It is not my type.” 

Alex, the priest, grabs a cross from his pocket as he stands up. “Who’s there?”
The bartender screamed. Apparently, Reddit had tired him and he no longer knew where he was. “Thank god, Alex, you stupid cunt.” He smiled, pointing at the priest’s cross. 

With the other hand, the bartender opened the Bible. “Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage—with great patience and careful instruction.” He looks up from behind the table. Alex sat there, on the floor, shocked. 

It was late afternoon, Alex was tired. He undid the knot on his balloon, which he had received on his fifth birthday. The balloon provided him with oxygen as he pondered over the joke Fyodor had told earlier. He drank a sundae that the bartender had made prior, but the drink had already started to phase in and out of existence. “Bartender. I do not like your drink, you should resign.” Alex grumbled, but the bartender was not in sight. Alex wondered where his brother was. 

“Is this seat taken?” Alex asked the priest as he motioned to the empty seat. But behold, the priest wasn’t there. Alex was the priest. The balloon was empty and he was running out of air. Alex took off his pair of slacks and put them on the counter. A teddy bear rises from behind the counter and takes the slacks. 

“I’m sorry, teddy bear. I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings.” He stared at the teddy bear who had put on his slacks. It looked more like a woman now. “The seat is empty.” Alex could hear the bartender say, he sat down on the empty seat. “Another sundae.” 

“What’s the problem, Alex?” Fyodor asked from behind, his hand still resting on his back as it slowly phased into Alex’s body. “Rub it.” Alex responded, Fyodor started rubbing his hand on Alex’s liver. “These sundaes aren’t good for you.” Fyodor said, but Alex insisted on drinking another one. But this time, the sundae had a cockroach in it. 

Alex ingested the drink orally, as intended. The bartender, his wife, shouts at him: “That’s enough! I’m not happy!” Alex wanted a divorce, his wife was the most selfish woman he had ever met. Fyodor took his hand out of Alex’s body and sat next to him. 

Alex looked at the teddy bear on the counter and then back at the bartender. “Bridgett. We’re getting a divorce.” He said confidently, but the woman looked at him happily. “Where are we going?” She asked, leaning forwards on the counter. “Nowhere, I don’t take married women to dinner. Now sign the papers.” He demanded, writing his initials on the piece of low quality paper, then handing it to the bartender.

“Sign here.” Alex pointed on the paper, Bridgett looked at his hand. She could not sign it. There was no paper. In fact, there was no Bridgett. Fyodor patted Alex’s back as he held hands with the teddy bear. Fyodor was the lawyer and he signed the papers. As for Alex, he was the one who liked his women how he liked his teddy bears, constipated and hungry.",8

A 19 year old was caught rubbing bread on his junk,"“What the hell are you doing!”

“That’s okay, I once made a mistake and miss took you for my son, but you’re not... now... here’s the cabbage... please, continue”

The 19 year old complied and did what he was told and said okay “dad”... apparently he liked calling him “dad”... they were both sex weirdos it seems.

But for those of you creeped out, don’t worry... it has a happy ending... they lived in a war zone in Germany during the 1930s and just then a bomb hit the house and they both died as war casualties.

Why the world is a bad place?,"World is a broad term that can be used for a number of things.

If you are asking about the world as earth I would like to tell you that it isn't bad.

But definitely it's not fair too. So if you relate unfairness with bad then definitely it feels bad.

The world is surrounded by selfish people.People who are ignorant are there too.

If you relate ignorance and selfishness with bad then definitely it feels bad.

But hey why look at things that make us feel bad.There is always another side to a coin.

That's another world for us..A world full of goodness.A world that cares.A world that heals and more importantly a world that loves.

Let's live in that world.Lets enjoy this world.

You see today the world is like a cake divided in two pieces the good and the bad.Some people find the bad tasty and some others find good to be tastier.

But I firmly believe that this world can be made entirely a world full of goodness .

And if you think this would create inbalance as we need both the dark and the blaze in this planet then you may be wrong.

We can have an entire cake completely tasty.

And I believe in it.

I firmly believe this world isn't bad if you are living in the same world as me.Its real and it's beautiful just that it is incomplete.",5
There's a secret subway station beneath a Las Vegas casino,"Dick, Dom and Dreyfus have been watching the entrance to a certain Las Vegas casino.

This certain casino cannot be named for legal reasons.

But Dick, Dom and Dreyfus are employees of the secretive The Intelligence Agency of the Commonwealth.

The trio have been closely watching the entrances to this certain Las Vegas casino for several weeks.

They have found that, on any given night, way, way way more people are leaving the casino than are entering.

After further investigation, they discovered that there is a secret subway station beneath the casino offering high speed underground rail trips to the Northwestern and East Coast cities.

Dick, Dom and Dreyfus were about to report this to their bosses but their iPhones began emitting bizarre high-pitched sounds before exploding

"Girl, Are You From Tennessee?","""Because, you're the only Ten I see.""

Ten looked at Seven disturbed. She had heard rumors that he had eaten Nine, and was a registered Six offender, but she never expected to run into him in public.

""Sir, I think it would be best if you stopped talking to me. I hear that line pretty much every day, and no, I'm not from Tennessee; I'm from Missouri. I highly doubt we'd be compatible anyways. A 10 divided by a 7 isn't even a Whole Number.""

Seven yelled at Ten: ""Fr\*ck you, you fat f\*m\*l\* d\*g. I wasn't even going to hit on you, but I decided to be nice, and hit on someone with more digits than I usually would.""

These words hurt Ten deeply. Despite knowing they were meaningless coming from a complete stranger, she was always self conscience about her extra digit. Despite having only 2 digits being relatively rare among numbers, she knew if she was just a number lower, she'd be able to be one digit fewer, or even if this joke was in hexadecimal instead of decimal. But no, this joke has to be in base ten, so Ten will be stuck with two digits for the time being.",432

A paraplegic walks into a bar,"Wait, maybe he wasn’t paraplegic?

anyways a possibly paraplegic, possibly not... possibly walked... maybe he didn’t... he could fly... humans can’t fly! but then he wouldn’t be human... are birds paraplegic? No! They couldn’t fly then! okay, he didn’t fly we can rule that out by logic, right? Assuming people don’t fly to bars.... ooh, it could be a wheelchair accessible airplane bar in first class... someone is a fancy!

So flying paraplegic wheels into a bar maybe? The bartender who was dead or wait... no... alive... the alive bartender said... excuse the dead bartender here, he won’t help... ordering from him would be a mistake, I can tell you THAT much... then again, I’m not a doctor, am I? Maybe we should check to see if he’s alive... is there a doctor in the house?

The maybe paraplegic maybe not said “hey I... definitely... maybe... may or may not be! Wheel me over to him and I may or may not be able to help or may make things worse!! But perhaps not also!”

I don’t know where this is going... I’m starting to think I’m not very good at jokes.

What did five fingers say to the face.,"First you must understand that fingers stem from the hand, they have nerve endings connecting all the way through the spinal chord to the brain... the brain of course has a mind capable of responding to patterns, feeling emotion and rationalizing and making decisions. But does it make decisions? What is consciousness? Let’s say we do have free will, are we not influenced by our surroundings? And suppose we do use our brain to communicate with that hand of ours. If we stared at it long enough could we gain insight in a way as if communicating with it?

But does the hand have free will? Does the mind? Do any of us? What does it really mean?

And as I sat there pondering the meaning of life I came to think that one could know the secrets of the universe through introspection with a simple question and various ponderings while staring at that hand. 

And in a single moment my life flashed before my eyes and I came to realize that the hand I was staring at was not my own, that I was in a catatonic state the last 5 hours and I was staring down the hand of a friend who was trying to get me to snap out of this state as the world seemed to stop and I say their frozen. Then it appeared the hand was coiled back as if to lunge sideways across the air. And I realized that perhaps we are all just air filled with individual molecules mostly made up of air with atoms mostly made of air and subatomic particles exhibiting quantum properties like the photon which is able to be in two places at once and constantly moving the same speed relative to the observer and thus perhaps it is in two places at once and two places in space time and if consciousness and time relative to that light changes, perhaps light contains multidimensional properties and is everywhere at once.

And if light is an omnipotent, omnipresent nature to all things, perhaps we are all interconnected through the light. And Jesus said behold I am the truth and the light, so perhaps we are all one and religion as science can merge into an ever-present awareness of the self in its relationship to each other and the universe.

Just then I saw that hand staring at my face, and I felt warm... for I felt as if I knew the secrets to the universe, consciousness, quantum field theory and life itself.... all from a single hand which had just approach my face.

And in that moment I was connected to the everpresent existence to our quantumly entangled world and I felt the presence of the Logos. The word used for Jesus but also a concept meaning word and reason. And I had discovered my true nature as an eternal being within this universe. Behold for as my face is one with the universe... the hand... 

And then it hit me.

I know! What the five fingers as one with the hand in a greater fractal pattern interconnected with fractals of cell’s which connect with fractal of molecules which are a branch of atoms which are a branch of layers of charged and uncharged energy below in patterns of subatomic and quantum level. I know what the five fingers said to the face! I knew it! And I not only knew it! I lived it! 
I was experiencing it now and it was beutiful. And then I felt the five fingers as a giant network of the universe interlaced through a quantum field interlacing with the blueprint of all matter... and as the five fingers communicated in this way I thought I heard something... it’s a sound that if we listen to the five fingers and hand talking to the face from the fractal pattern of our earth to the solar system down to the atom and up to the galexy from the minute to the gargantuan size of the universe itself and through the interconnected cosmic energy causing the ripple effect of the air vibrating the hairs on our outer ear drum and vibrating the inner ear being translated through the brain and from the brain which processes it all we can hear it as well. We can hear the five fingers saying to the face the inner workings of the universe. 

In conclusion, as I was pondering this wonderful magnificent feeling, I felt a pain of the five fingers for I was jarred from this infinite bliss and shocked back into reality. And the only thing I knew at that time was the hand and the face, but no longer in a metaphysical way but more of a “physical” way. And despite all of what I had said, at this moment the five fingers said to the face something and I heard and felt it in my face.

the five fingers said to the face....

A gang of pirates walk into a bar,"They were all intoxicated and bringing their own bottles of rum inside, while singing at full throats:

""Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me! We pillage, we plunder, we rifle, and loot!Drink up, me 'earties, yo ho! We kidnap and ravage and don't give a hoot! Drink up-.. ♫  ♫

The bartender yelled and cut them off: ""Oi! Cahm the fackh down, stop making all this fuzz in 'ere. You're not allowed to bring yer own drinks, take those outsyde.""

One of the pirates yelled back at the bartender: ""Yarr, ye insolent little cahnt! Noone orders a pirate on how to conduct himself!""

The bartender replied, angrily: ""Out! Out now, you fackh ugly bums! Don't come in 'ere again!""

The pirates all muttered in disappointment and stumbled back outside the bar together.

A bunch of soccer hooligans came stumbling in right afterwards, yelling: ""Cheeeelseeeeea! Go Chelseaaaa! Chelseaaa!""

The bartender yelled, again: ""Oi! What did I tell ya? Leave my bar now, you hideous mahnkeys!""

One of the hooligans rebuted: ""What did you call us?! We haven't even been hea befoh! The fackhing cheek on you, yah belligerent bastard!""

The bartender replied: ""Oh, I'm so sorry, mates. There's been a mix-up. Some other rowdy men that looked jhast lyke you jhast came in before you, cahsing trahble. I'm terribly sorry, again!""

The hooligan nodded and said: ""Alright, that's fhyne. It's the semi-finals an' all, so I guess there's alot of noyse and tension toniyte.""

The bartender smiled and said: ""You don't say. Bloody hell, let me accomodate you with a round of shots f'my behaviour jhast now. It's been a stressful nyte.""

The hooligans all cheered and lined up at the counter.

""So, tell me. What do you think the odds are for the game thamorrow?"" The bartender asked the hooligans as he was pouring the shots.

One of the hooligans replied: ""Fackh me, I mean it's lookin' quyte good foh Chels-..""

The pirates suddenly stormed into the bar and charged everyone inside with sharp sabres, looking to exact revenge. They cut down all the hooligans as they screamed in terror and agony, one of them was beheaded and his head rolled across the bar counter as the bartender screamed:

""Oh my god! No! Why is this happening!? Why?! I'm sorry, lads! Please! It's been a tyhring nyte! I didn't mean what I said earlier!!""

The bartender was also cut down and the whole establishment became engulfed in a blood orgy as all the other patrons that happened to be at the bar were killed as well. The pirates exited the bar together and continued the song they were singing earlier, before they were interrupted:

"" ..me 'earties, yo ho! Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me! We extort, we pilfer, we filch, and sack!"" ♫

On the TV broadcasted news the announcement came a few hours after the event:

""This jhast in. A gang of pyhrates(?!) have allegedly attacked a pahb neah Chelsea Bridge, mahltiple people confirmed dead. Police are about t'make an announcement.""

The son stared silently at the wall ahead of him, which the father noticed.

""What the hell is going on with you tonight? Speak up, say something!"" The father loudly ordered.

The son started to sing, silently: ""Yo ho, yo ho a pirate's life for me...we pillage we rape... we push your shit in straight. Pass that chynese boy around and yo ho..."" ♫  ♫

""What? What was that?"" The father asked.

The son replied: ""An hour ago, some drunk men with eye patches, hooks for hands and wooden limbs came into the bathroom near the main lobby, where I was taking a piss and started taking turns molesting me, father.""",3

Let me tell you what actually happened in the 1700s...,"In the mid 1700s, at the height of the ""Transatlantic Slave Trade"", things take a turn for the worst after aliens from outer space invade.

Later nicknamed ""The Black Nordics"" on account of their unusually black skin and piercing blue eyes, this technologically advanced cyborg race suddenly strikes Earth as tens of thousands of Africans are being transported across the Atlantic.

The *Mauretania*, an ageing slave ship carrying 976 Africans onboard with 43 European slavers first witnessed the shocking sight.Winged machines, emitting sounds unheard until that moment, whizzed overheard before stunning projectiles were emitted from their bodies and exploded on the *Mauretania*. Most of the slaves and slavers died but a few survivors lived to tell the tale.

This marked the first attack.

The following few months saw a quick end to the human slave trade as tribes, kingdoms, nations and Empires across Earth quickly realized that ""demons"" from ""another world"" were massacring millions. A British Empire-led resistance recruited tens of millions of men and boys across the world from Central Africa to East Asia to Arabia. In an effort to attempt to defeat The Black Nordics, humans were quick with inventions and technological progress.

Although the winged machines of the Black Nordics were few and their great big giant ""city ships"" which carried the winged machines were few, they were powerful and terrifying.

The first ""aeroplane"", what humanity now called the ""winged machines"", was invented by two Frenchmen in 1812 after a British Empire-led attack managed to shoot down one of the winged machines and learn more about the technologies involved. Russian allies then began developing what humans now refer to as ""missiles"" with a number of West African allies developing ""land missiles"", technologically advanced projectiles fired with speed from ground-based cannon-like machines.

By 1848, the human death toll from the war against the aliens had surpassed 269 million, but a British Empire-led push for higher births to contribute to the fight against the aliens saw the world's population balloon to 5 billion by 1862. 

With the Black Nordics outnumbered and humanity quickly catching up in technological advancement, the war suddenly ended after the aliens abruptly left Earth, possibly the entire solar system (by then, human understanding of the universe and astronomy and cosmology had progressed quickly in an effort to find out where the aliens actually came from).

The aliens had left some of their warships and jets behind and the global alliance which had been built up after the mid-1700s quickly collapsed as conflicts ensued over who got to research the alien technologies and keep them.

The British Empire quickly fell as a result and several ""cold wars"" ensued between West Africa and Russia following disagreements between engineers and scientists and the militaries.

North America was carved up between the Confederation of West Africa and the Republic of Britannia (the offspring of the British Empire), which labelled regions in North America as ""dependencies"" and ""territories"".

The First World War began in 1879 after border disputes in North America between the Confederation of West Africa and the Republic of Britannia.

The Confederation allies included The French Republic, the Spanish Republic, the Imperial States of Russia (a new monster which had gobbled up half of Asia and Eastern Europe), the Aboriginal League (the informal Australasian ""nation"" which had a combined population of 200 million following population explosions during the war with the aliens), the Nordic Union (now recovering from its depressing ostracization following the alien invasion) and the Seven Kingdoms of India.

The Republic of Britannia's allies included the Duchy of New Africa, an extremely oil and mineral-rich ""dependency"" in the southeast of North America, the Portuguese Federation, the North Atlantic League (a loose union of Eastern European revolutionaries fighting against the ISR), the Republic of New Africa, another resources-rich ""dependency"" in southwestern North America, the Holy Roman Union, a semi-formal political and economic union stretching from Northwestern Africa and Italia to Germanic regions in Western Europe, which had rotating capitals, with Ljubljana being the current ""capital of Europe"" during the First World War. Many labelled the Holy Roman Union as ""the center of the world"", with its post Greco-Roman architecture and heavy religious presence. (The Pope is the official head of state and the head of the Roman Catholic church. He selects the government cabinet and the First Minister, the head of government.) When people say ""Europe"", images of towns and cities in the Holy Roman Union spring to mind. The economic and political powerhouse largely bankrolled the Britannia-led side in the First World War.

An awkward silence permeated the living room, a silence that was occasionally broken by the screams of the autistic neighbour from across the street.

Liam's wife looked at him empathically and said: ""Yes, honey? What is it? It's okay, we'll get through this, together.""

Liam's wife started crying and left the room in a hurry.

""Now, where was I?!"" Liam exclaimed before the phone rang again. He still didn't recognize his father's cellphone number as he looked at the display. He answered it.

The voice at the other end sounded distant and was partially interrupted by static, it went: ""Liam, you jackass! I was \*static\*ying to tell you that I neede\*static\* help.

His ghostly father replied: ""Is that the fu\*static\* TV I'm hearing in the background?! Are you seriously getting off to a TV broadcast again? Have you ever hear\*static\* of internet porn?!""

Liam threw his phone at the wall, shattering it and finally climaxed just as the TV image shifted from Kellyanne Conway to Larry King again. Liam suddenly formed an angry facial expression and yelled at the TV:

"A human centipede of 8, well groomed homosexual men with their penises inside of one another walked into a bar.","The bartender looked at the men in a state of both perplexion and disgust.

""Wow, it's just another Saturday night for you people, huh?"" The bartender said.

""Wow, well that sounded kind of snarky and offensive."" The man leading the centipede replied.

""What do you mean by 'you people'?"" Replied the man behind him.

""You're being very insensitive to your paying customers, honey. We're not going to take it."" Said the third in line.

The bartender smirked and said: ""You all seem to already be taking it, you're way ahead of yourselves there.""

The bartender then looked inbetween the men individually, shooting quick glances at their lower bodies before speaking again: ""I'm not having this kind of sexual behaviour and deviancy in my bar, either stop it or get out.""

""Stop what? We're not doing anything sexual, we're all conjoined octuplets!"" Replied the 4th man.

""We can't help it! We were born this way! We came out like a train when born, our mother died as we were too much of a strain on her!"" Said the 5th man while on the verge of tears.

""..and you're being an abrasive piece of shit about it. Come on, gang, we're leaving!"" Said the man in the lead.

The bartender sighed and said: W-wait, I'm sorry. How was I supposed to know that?""

The human centipede, ignoring the bartender, gradually turned around while taking up a lot of space in order to do so, moving in a similar fashion to that of a semi-truck and headed towards the exit.

After they had left a group of black men in balaclavas/ski masks walked in, carrying various items with them such as car tires, hub caps, a TV, a Blue Ray player and sneakers, among other things.

The bartender cocked an eyebrow and exclaimed: ""Whoah, hey there! Where did you get all those items from? I'm not about to serve a bunch of unidentifiable blacks on a burglary spree, while rioting or whatever the hell is going on here!""

All the men stopped in their tracks, looking shocked. One of the men spoke up: ""Excuse me!? These are my friends and they're helping me move. None of us could provide any transportation so we have to carry these several blocks. It's also a cold winter night so we decided cover our faces. We were starting to feel a little parched so we decided to get something to drink!""

""Fuck you, man! Let's bounce, homies!"" Said another.

""For crying out loud, wait!"" Yelled the bartender.

The men ignored the bartender and left.

Next came a group of what seemed to be hooded clansmen from the KKK. The bartender, now feeling distraught due to his prior encounters, tried to force a smile and a more likeminded and friendly demeanour. He looked at them gleefully and said: ""Finally, my type of crowd! I like it! White power, right? What can I get you fine gentlemen?""

The group stopped approaching the counter, one of them replied: ""That's disgusting! We're doing a performance in the theatre across the street in fifteen minutes and don't have enough time to remove and put on our costumes again. We're just looking to steady our nerves with a few drinks, since this is the premiere and an important night for us!""

""Let's go to the bar at the end of the street, screw this place."" Another member exclaimed.

The bartender groaned and dug his face onto the bar counter in embarrasment as they left.

A group of disfigured people walked in next, some had distorted bodies and impaired limbs, while others had large facial scars and deformed skulls. After looking up from the counter again, the bartender was somewhat apprehensive about saying anything but eventually decided to speak, again forcing a more social and friendly demeanour:

""Ah, you guys must be part of the theatre play too. I'm loving the latex masks and the rest of the get-up, everything looks very authentic. You're all so hideous, haha! Such a gang of circus freaks, my god! I'm getting chills over here, that's some great work and attention to detai-..""

One of them immediately cut the bartender off, screaming: ""We all have chronic illnesses! How dare you!? Let's get out of here, guys!""

The bartender slammed his head into the counter repeatedly and eventually buried his face, yet again.

A group of arabs walked in next, seemingly wearing belts carrying explosives around their waists. Upon hearing their footsteps, the bartender raised his head from the counter.

""No, come on! You've got to be kidding me! This is getting fucking ridiculous, I'm not touching this one with a ten foot pole!"" The bartender yelled.

""Actually, wait. Before I manage to offend another group of paying customers, let me guess. You're part of a demolition team that are on a break from work and just getting some refreshments, yeah? You're wearing those belts so you can carry the explosives around easily?"" Asked the bartender.

""ALLAHU AKBAR!"" The arabs yelled in unison before detonating their explosives.",126
"A lemon, a lime, and a persimmon roll into a bar.","The lemon orders an old fashioned with lemon. The bartender pours the drink and garnishes it with a slice of lemon.

The lime orders a corona with lime. The lemon would have been appalled by his spouse's behavior if he wasn't such a sick fuck himself. The bartender passes her the beer with a lime wedge sitting on top.

The persimmon orders a Moscow mule, but the bartender refused to pour the beverage.

""I'm afraid I cannot serve you an alcoholic drink,"" said the bartender.

""Why not?"" said the persimmon. The two citruses rotated about their semi major axes to view the spectacle.

""Because the year is 2376, and Hatchya persimmons have been extinct for decades,"" explained the bartender. ""I cannot serve alcohol to a customer who does not exist.""

""Fuyu,"" said the persimmon. ""I'm not fat, I'm the surrogate mother of the love child of the lemon and the lime.""

""In that case,"" continued the bartender, ""I cannot in good conscious serve alcohol to a pregnant fruit, extant or not.""

At that moment, the persimmon gave birth to a watermelon.

""It's a boy!"" exclaimed the lemon.

""He has my father's rind!"" noted the lime.

""No one under the age of 21 is permitted in this establishment,"" thought the skeleton bartender. But he was so overcome with joy, that instead he said nothing, and served everyone a free drink.",6

A dog walks into a bar.,"The dog sits up on the counter seat, attracting some strange looks from patrons. One of the two customers sitting next to the dog hold out their hand as if asking if he could be petted, but the dog avoids their hands, leaving a slightly confused look on the customer's face.

""What can I get you?"" the bartender asks. ""I would like to have a beer, please; more specifically, a non-alcoholic beer without the beer."" the dog replies snobbishly, with an accompanied snort.

The bartender looks slightly bemused at the dog's strange request, but accepts the order anyway.  
After a few minutes of the bartender serving other patrons, the dog's order is given to him within three seconds: an empty glass. The expression on the dog's face, originally as neutral as a dog's face can be, now looks slightly annoyed. Before the bartender can leave, the dog challenges the bartender with ""This is not what I asked for.""

The bartender says ""Huh? You asked for a beer without a beer. That's what I gave you.""

The dog snorts. ""Excuse me, it was a _non-alcoholic_ beer. And this is not what I asked for. You see, I asked for an impossible request: I asked for something that qualifies as a beer but is not a beer, and is non-alcoholic. Clearly, nothing can fit this description by the law of non-contradiction, and yet you still gave me something. This means that whatever you have given me is incorrect.""

The bartender replies with ""It may have been the case that the denotative meaning of the thing you asked clearly has no match, and is therefore impossible; however, the connotative meaning of what you asked is that you wanted the package of a beer, glass + beer, minus alcohol, minus the beer. That's simply a glass minus the alcohol, and since a glass has no alcohol, this is what you wanted under your connotative meaning.""

The dog replies snarkily ""Being a dog, I clearly evade human intuition when it comes to thought. When you took my order, a good bartender would have seen the dog in the seat and realized that since the dog thinks in a completely different way than humans do that it may choose to use the declarative meaning rather than the connotative in order to avoid confusion, and therefore taken the declarative meaning as the thing that the dog wanted.""

The bartender questions ""Yet you, as a dog, are currently speaking perfect English, and replying to my responses perfectly. This means that you must indeed have an understanding of the connotative meaning of how humans speak in order to even respond to the responses I am giving you. Therefore, you know that connotative meanings are taken into account, and therefore provided something that fits under the connotative meaning rather than the declarative.""

The dog says, ""Indeed! However, I simply accounted for the fact that if you were a _good_ bartender, then you would have taken the declarative meaning, and provided me with what I wanted. And remember that the only reasonable response to the connotative meaning of the order would be to take the declarative meaning under general human behavior, you would have done what I wanted anyway! Therefore, I simply accounted for the declarative meaning, and not the connotative.""

The bartender exclaims, ""Enough! We all know that this is folly. The _true_ answer here is that whereas you, as a dog, somehow use perfect declarative meaning and the logical axioms to construct your perception of the world, we as humans use connotative meaning and ill-defined axioms to construct our perception of the world. The fundamental difference here is in the axiomatic system being used, and therefore can never be fixed unless one of us changes our fundamental axioms, which is impossible without killing ourselves.""

The dog says with a tone of finality, ""However, since I still feel annoyed, I can and will disprove the fundamental axioms of human perception as even being axioms in the first place, and simply construct for myself a bar where the bartender is a _good_ bartender _and_ the declarative meaning is taken into account first.""

Around the dog, the lights flicker rapidly before cutting out, removing all light in the bar. Several of the patrons look around in surprise, and a guy reading a book in the back looks up disappointed.
  
Then, the patron next to the dog begins to flicker. Their image seems to randomly stretch in its dimensions and change state, from the patron smiling to drunk to depressed to crying to naked to nonexistent. Several of the patrons seeing one of their members dissipate this suddenly rapidly begin to panic, and they flood out of the bar quickly. The bartender, however, makes no attempt to move as the floorboards stretch and crack under the stress of being logically disproven to even exist. A strange expression appears on the bartender's face before morphing into a smile.

Suddenly, all logical disproving stops. The lights turn back on to illuminate a now mostly empty bar, and the floorboards seem to be back where they were. Even the patron next to the dog reappears again.

The dog exclaims in horror, ""What happened?!"" The dog's face looks shallow at considering that _their_ axioms may be inconsistent.

The bartender smiles and simply says ""I have figured out your little 'trick', and have something for you. Since you have proven our logical axioms inconsistent, by the principle of explosion, I can prove anything I want. 1+1=3, something that is true is false, and you are nonexistent and never have ever existed.""

The dog looks horrified at his blunder and immediately jumps off the bar stool in an attempt to dash away, and fails. The dog's image beings to warp and stretch, cycling through everything the dog has ever done before immediately collapsing back in on itself and everything in the bar reverting. The bar looks the same as it always had, with the same customer in the corner reading a book, an empty stool that might have housed a dog if a dog came into the bar, and patrons drinking their beer as usual.

What the bartender doesn't realize, though, is that he himself committed a blunder, a blunder so significant that he cannot ever realize he had committed it. By making the dog not exist via the principle of explosion, he himself has forgotten how to manipulate the logical makeup of the world around him and therefore has given up the power over everything in existence and everything not in existence, something that kings and queens and presidents have striven for for eons.

Perhaps you could say that the bartender's blunder was _explosively_ bad.",5

The Czar decreed that whomever gets rid of the witch would get to marry his daughter.  The two oldest brothers, heard this and immediately set out.

""You're out of your depth, grandpa. Content is the remedy of the past. Happiness is the future.""

""Perhaps. But who's to say happiness won't suffer the same fate as content, only to be replaced by something else?""

""I will not be around when that happens. I wish to indulge in the joys of life as much as I can while I'm still here.""

""Then why are you unhappy?""

""Happiness presupposes reasons. I have no reason to be happy. Being happy without a reason is a sign of dementia.""

""Is wanting to be happy not a wonderful reason to be happy?""

""Huh. I guess it is."" The tycoon smiles. ""Thank you, good sir. How might I repay you?""

""I want to know how to be happy.""

""Happiness is a choice. You can only be happy if you wish to be happy. Wanting to be happy is the first step towards happiness.""

""That's balderdash—seeking happiness will only make you more miserable. Happiness must come to you naturally.""

""You're right. Wanting to be happy is the first step towards happiness, but it is only that—the first step. The second step is to allow happiness to flow into your mind. It's like establishing a socket—you can't expect to receive data before you open a port.""

A scandal involving Homelander and a transgender woman,"Homelander was in the process of roughly and violently apprehending 4 high-value suspects in a terror cell when he noticed that a blonde-haired transgender woman was filming him on their iPhone.

He bellowed across to the individual to stop filming him.

The bystander shook their head vigorously and yelled back that they will upload the video to YouTube ""so that everybody can know what a bad man you are"".

Homelander bellowed back that the bystander was a ""stupid bitch"" and that they looked ""like a fucking whore"" (Homelander's words).

The bystander was visibly shocked and protested that they were extremely offended and that they were ""proud to be transgender"". Homelander then zipped across the street and smashed the bystander's iPhone and then flew away.

Another bystander had been filming the altercation from behind his Buick and promptly uploaded it to Twitter, YouTube and Facebook amongst other sites.

The bystander (the one who identified as a woman) was later interviewed by several large media outlets and the story became front-page news and even overtook coverage of Presidential impeachment hearings. The scandal then made global news after the now-nationally famous bystander apparently ""spontaneously combusted"" live on-air during an interview with MSNBC.

The bystander's family sued Homelander and Vought International for US$17m and US$23m respectively.

The other bystander has now been deported to Mexico following an immigration raid.",0

a simple ""No"" resounding ""*HIM*"", the thought that had been drifting through a world that he had posssibly created for 26 years.

Was the world a thought?

Was the world *his* thought, attached to his being, an extension of his reality, 

which as perceived now was everything he saw with sight, 

but when he closed his eyes he was just a thought,

a jumble of words that other thoughts had taught him were correct in the way they were formed and presented?

And now his thought was hot, 

and flustered, 

and anxiety blistered on his invisisble body while thoughts bloomed left and right in his who the fuck knows how big or small of a space, questions of existential nature pounding on his physical body which now seemed more like a shell for his brain,

was his thoughts now insane?

A horse walked into a long face,,2
"A rusty old knight, a rusty old knight and a clown walk into a bar.","The bar is a bar for rusty old knights - a tavern if you will - which means that the bartender is a rusty old knight, the bar-wenches are rusty old knights, the porters, grooms and stewards are rusty old knights. Even the rusty old accountant is a rusty old knight.

The rusty old knight says to the rusty old knight:

""Good sir, my only quest is to drink a flagon of ale in a tavern staffed exclusively by rusty old knights. It is my rusty old purpose. The only thing that keeps me going.""

The rusty old knight says to the rusty old knight:

""Good sir, *my* only quest is to keep this rusty old knight from ever drinking a single flagon of ale in any tavern staffed exclusively by rusty old knights, in order to sustain this rusty old knight's fragile sense of purpose. This in turn is *my* rusty old purpose, the only thing that keeps me going, and the reason I keep him always by my side.""

The rusty old knight says to the rusty old knight:

""Good sir, **my** only quest is to furnish a flagon of ale to a rusty old knight whose only quest is to drink a flagon of ale in a tavern staffed exclusively by rusty old knights, in order to *drain* him of his sense of purpose, because the purposeless husk of a knight is exactly the right size and weight to keep barrels from rolling away. This, is **my** rusty old purpose, and the only reason for which I own and manage a tavern for rusty old knights, staffed exclusively by rusty old knights.""

And so, the three knights fall into a co-dependent relationship: the rusty old knight vies to furnish the rusty old knight with a flagon of ale. The rusty old knight vies to receive a flagon of ale from the rusty old knight. And the rusty old knight vies to keep the rusty old knight from receiving a flagon of ale from the rusty old knight, and to keep the rusty old knight from furnishing the rusty old knight with a flagon of ale. In this way the trio becomes a three-way nexus - a self-sustaining cycle of deferred resolution in which each member is continuously on the point of, but never reaches fulfilment.

Over time this abstract relationship begins to take on a concrete from of its own, eventually manifesting as a rusty old triangle, which the narrator carefully peels out of the joke, and sews into the flag of Guyana.

""I don't understand,"" says Adelia Smith, third wife of professional vexillologist Whitney Smith, designer of the flag of Guyana ""why did you go to all the trouble of weaving a narrative about three rusty old knights, each dependent on the others if all you wanted was another triangle for your flag? And more to the point, why did you include the clown in the premise when you didn't refer to him once in the rest of the joke?""

""I'm a professional vexillologist,"" says professional vexillologist Whitney Smith, ""and if you think you can tell *me* a better way of getting triangles, I'd like to hear it.""",15
"A blonde, a brunette, and a redhead walk into a bar.","The bartender goes, ""I thought two-headed giants only had two heads, unlike us hydras which have up to eight.""

The giant looked the bartender in the eyes and replied, ""Why the long face, face, face, face, face, face, face, face?""

&#x200B;

That's the time when the beholder floated out, sobbing uncontrollably and wailing, ""Sempai doesn't like me!""

&#x200B;

""I can't believe that worked,"" said the eight bartender heads in perfect harmony, ""That beholder was soo annoying!""

&#x200B;

The giant nodded thrice, ""I think I know them from monster school.  Always into the anime.  I should beat them with a little stick.""

&#x200B;

""Where are you going to get a little stick from?"" The bartender asked.

&#x200B;

The giant just shrugged, ""I'm sure one will turn up at the end of this joke.""

&#x200B;

The bartender nodded, ""Well, now that the stupid beholder is gone, every head after the second one gets a free drink on the house!""

&#x200B;

""Hooray,"" chorused Murgoth, the hundred faced.

&#x200B;

""Not you, Murgoth,"" the bartender clarified.

&#x200B;

""Aww, nuts!"" Murgoth echoed.

"It is 2117 and a lawmaker walks into a bar in Henderson, NV in the American Sector","He's not happy.

""*Cheer up, bud,*"" the barman says. ""*It can't be that bad.*""

""*It's been a frustrating week. Startups across the Sectors are putting pressure on me to push a law through which makes it mandatory to make the latest suspended animation techniques and technology more accessible to the less fortunate and less well off.

The barman had frozen and had a blank stare.

The lawmaker shook his head and rolled his eyes. The lifelike android had probably malfunctioned. Nevada was so behind everywhere else in the American Sector, even behind the likes of Kentucky and Mississippi and Delaware and New Baja California.

At that point, the android barman then let out a deafening roar and exploded, instantly killing the lawmaker and everyone else in the bar.

Bob also hated cliches, where the protagonist gets the girl, and lives happily ever after the end. It’s bland and it gets boring. So Bob wishes his good friend Dragon a good day, and went home to his super hot wife and lived happily ever after. The End.",2

Four Nuns Walk Into a Bar,"Each one has brought her own drink.

The First Nun produces a small bottle of whiskey, saying ""I've heard drinking is a sin, so I'll only drink a little.""

The second nun pulls out an average bottle of whiskey, saying ""I heard drinking is a sin, so I'll drink enough that I won't be able to remember doing it.""

The third nun shows off a huge bottle of whiskey, saying ""Drinking is a sin, so I'll just drink enough that neither me nor God himself will remember!""

The fourth nun says nothing.  A low, unholy gurgle escapes her lips.  Her eyes turn a glassy white and her skin a sallow green.  The other nuns at the table start to stand up and back away, but she throws her head back and a battery of devilish spikes emerge from inside her throat.  They run, but the spikes explode out from the beast, embedding into the bodies of the nuns, the bartender, all the patrons in the crossfire unable to flee.

The bartender clutches his impaled shoulder, watching the second and third nuns choke and convulse in front of him.  He feels the toxins course though his own veins and accepts his death.  The fourth nun crawls towards him on all fours, and he can see its jaw unhinge like an angler fish through his blurring vision.  Its putrid breath hits his nostrils.  But suddenly, the First Nun stands up, seemingly unharmed.  She pounces from behind, wrapping a rosary around the neck of the beast, shouting into its ear a prayer the likes of which the bartender has never heard.  The beast screams, and its flesh smokes, and it wrestles and fights for its impure life dragging the First Nun behind the bar.

After a moment the First Nun emerges, battered but victorious.  She limps to the still conscious bartender and presses the small whiskey bottle to his lips.  ""Not alcohol.  It's antivenom.  Drink.""  He obeys.  After a minute he feels fine.  He surveys the destruction around him, the two dead nuns, and despite his gratitude he can't help but ask the one burning question in his mind.

He points to the thing behind the bar and asks ""what the hell is that?""

The First Nun watches as a fifth nun walks into the bar wearing a neatly pressed suit and tie, carrying a briefcase.  ""That's Nun of your Business.""",163

“Alright..” the bellhop explains. “It just so happens that we have one room available”, as he slides a key towards the man.

The man, out of the corner of his eye, sees the “NO VACANCY” sign outside brightly lit, which puzzled him. He turns to the bellhop exuding shocking terror.

“I lied.” the bartender said.

Priest: That's right Frank - Moscow Eel for me.

Bartender: Coming right up.

Imam: What in the world is a Moscow Eel?

Priest: A Moscow Eel? You've never heard of a Moscow Eel?

Imam: Nope.

Rabbi: Neither have I. What's in it?

Priest: Well... You got your ginger, your lime, your vodka...

Rabbi: What else?

Priest: Guess.

Imam: Surely there isn't actually an eel in it?

Rabbi: No way.

Priest: Bingo.

Imam: An eel? As in an actual eel?

Priest: I promise you, it tastes divine.

Rabbi: I don't believe this! Is the eel just sorta swimming around in there?

Priest: No, it's dead you numpty! It's not wriggling around or anything. It's a dead eel and you just sorta swallow it all up with the booze.

Rabbi: Well that sounds swell but count me out. I'll stick to something that isn't out of a David Lynch movie.

Priest: Don't knock it til you try it...

Rabbi: Just a glass of red for me, Frank.

Bartender: Anything in particular?

Rabbi: No Frank, surprise me. You always choose the good stuff, you got a better palette for it than I do.

Bartender: Alright, I'll pick you something out.

Rabbi: You know my taste better than I do - you'll pick me something just right out, I know you will, Frank.

Bartender: Sure, sure. I'll pick you something out.

Rabbi: As long as it ain't got no eels in!

Bartender: And for yourself?

Imam: I'll have a coke please.

Bartender: Ice?

Imam: No, thank you Frank.

Bartender: OK fellas - so one Moscow Eel, a glass of red, and a coke no ice.

Priest/Rabbi/Imam (in unison): Thanks, Frank.

Bartender: So, you fellas been busy today then?

Imam: Yeah, it's been a long day. There are plans for a new mosque on Princeton Avenue - the council are in talks with some of the people there currently and they want to consult me on it. A lot of meetings and idle talk, you know how it is.

Bartender: Yeah, I feel ya. Now remind me, Princeton Avenue, is that road you go down past the huge storage place, with the little strip of restaur-

Imam: -that's the one-

Bartender: -the nice restaurants?

Imam: A little further up.

Bartender: Ah, nice part of town.

Imam: Yeah, very good location. It's gonna be big by the sound of it. Should be good for the community.

Bartender: Well I look forward to it. You get up to much Father?

Priest: I married a couple today.

Bartender: Awh, that's sweet.

Priest: From the look on the groom's face, they won't be married long.

Bartender: Oh God, really?

Priest: Looked like he'd have rather been anywhere else. Almost choked as he spluttered out the words 'I do'. Coulda swore he winced as he said it.

Rabbi: Almost choked! Ha!

Priest: Looked like a nice kid though, I felt bad for him really. His mother looked more enthusiastic than he did. Sitting there, huge hat on her head, like a big meringue - sobbing and smiling. 'They're so dreamy together!' she kept saying. Talk about living vicariously through your children.

Imam: Happens more than you think. You see so many young people still at the beck and call of their parents instead of living their own lives.

Rabbi: Yeah, and it's a real shame. If I'd gone the way my mother had wanted, I'd probably still be in that cramped little office in Milwaukee, making ten dollars an hour, wishing I could shove every rotten cent up my boss's ass. So, I'm thankful I got outta there as soon as I could.

Imam: And you found God.

Rabbi: Right, best boss of all. Even if the pay's still lousy...

Bartender: Just bear with me a second fellas while I go and get the wine.

Priest: Sure, Frank.

Imam: Of course.

Rabbi: Pick me out a good one.

The bartender exits. They wait for his return in silence. Everything is still. There is no indication that time is passing, other than low drone of their breathing, like the ticking of an infinite clock. It slowly dawns on the men that the bartender is never coming back. He no longer exists - he has faded into nothingness like the shadow of a smoke ring. And they come to realise that there is nothing beyond these four walls, nothing beyond the sunlit facade that stands limply behind the windows. All is absence. No Princeton Avenue. No sobbing mother with a hat like a meringue. No Milwaukee. They try to speak, at least, like talk might save them, but there is nothing left for these men to say to one another, and even if there were, they couldn't say it anyway - their decisions are not theirs to make, determined, as they are, by me. Perhaps they pray that their Gods might hear them, and save them from their own absurdity, but their Gods have no power here. They sit there, the three of them, staring into the shrieking void for an eternity.

Why did Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer call in sick?,"Because billions of people had been abducted on December 21st 2019 and it was most unlikely that many rounds would be done anyway and given that Rudolf's pay was contingent-based ($17,000 per five hundred presents delivered), it seemed unlikely that many presents would even get delivered (it was a requirement of Claus Inc that persons must be present at home and asleep when the presents are delivered and given that billions of people had been abducted by aliens, this seemed highly unlikely).

Ergo, Rudolf called in sick. 

A few days after Christmas, Rudolf then heard that Claus Inc had gone into liquidation on account of apocalyptically low levels of revenue and very few presents being delivered and Santa Claus Jr, the heir to Claus Inc had absconded after reportedly embezzling ""millions"" from Claus Inc. Such events had rendered Santa Claus, the majority owner of Claus Inc, dangerously ill and sick with worry. Santa Claus died at 1.37am on January 1st, 2020. He was survived by his estranged son, Santa Claus Jr (who has several arrest warrants issued in his name) and Mrs Claus, who is still managing the liquidation.

"An apple, an orange, and a banana walked into a bar.","There were no barstools, and so the three were forced to sit on the counter.

""My bar stools were stolen,"" the bartender explained. ""Instead of raising prices, I'm collecting donations to purchase new ones. Would you like to contribute?""

The banana spoke for the group and said, ""One of us is not like the others. If you can determine which, we will donate five dollars.""

The bartender examined the fruit for a few moments, before raising his sledgehammer, and smashing the orange. Pulp shot across the countertop and the other two fruits were sprayed with orange juice.

""Well done!"" said the banana, slipping a five dollar bill into the tip jar. ""The orange was the only one of us who knew what happened to the barstools. However, there is still one of us that is not like the other. I will make an additional donation if you can determine which.""

The bartender glanced between the apple and banana. The light mist of orange juice made the apple's red skin radiant and reflective, allowing the bartender to see his own bony face for the first time in millennia. He swung the sledgehammer high over his head, and with a tremendous thud he slayed the apple.

""Amazing!"" the banana said, placing another five dollar bill into the tip jar. ""The apple was the only one who didn't know what happened to the barstools!""

The bartender pointed his bony finger at the banana. ""It is YOU who are not like the others! The other two either knew or did not know what happened to the barstools. You somehow evade this classification.""

""Brilliant!"" the banana exclaimed, tipping yet another five dollars. ""I am indeed the odd one out. Now, before you end my life, would you like to know what happened to your barstools?""

""The orange was the only one who knew that, *thief*,"" the skeleton bartender said, raising his sledgehammer. With a gratuitous smash, he flattened the banana against the countertop. The bartender never found out what happened to his barstools, but with fifteen dollars at least he could purchase new ones.",146

Exciting anticipation today here at the Utah Data Center,"Brogan, Brad, Brendan, Brandon, Brodie, Ben, Brett and Brock are excitedly waiting for a special meeting with agents from the DIA and agents from the US-Niger Joint Intelligence Mission.

As it turns out, the work of Brendan, Brandon, Brodie, Brad, Brogan, Brett and Ben and Brock has led to the discovery of a terror cell in Niger which is communicating with a terror cell in Little Rock, AR to carry out a possible ""grenade and machine gun"" attack on a high school near Little Rock.

The man called Jesus is shocked and pulls out his Colt and shoots the barman dead in retaliation. ""I was talking to this hot bitch, you asshole!"" The man called Jesus bellows.

A penguin is ice fishing at the North pole.,"""I hope to catch some fish today,"" says the penguin. She lowers the baited hook into the frigid water.

""I hope I don't get eaten,"" says the bait, a sentient gummy worm, the fancy sugar-coated kind.

""I hope a fish doesn't swallow me,"" says the hook, a sentient paperclip, the fancy grooved kind.

""I hope I don't snap,"" says the line, a sentient strand of wool, the fancy superwash merino kind.

A largemouth bass swims up to the bait. ""HELLO,"" the largemouth bass says. ""I'M A LARGEMOUTH BASS. I EAT SENTIENT GUMMY WORMS, THE FANCY SUGAR-COATED KIND. WHAT DO YOU EAT?""

The worm shivers, mostly from fear, but also from the cold water too. ""Uh....I eat...hooks! Sentient paperclip hooks, the fancy grooved kind. I have one in me right now...better watch out!""

""I LOVE HOOKS,"" says the largemouth bass. ""ESPECIALLY PAPERCLIPS, THE FANCY GROOVED KIND. I HAVE SEVERAL IN ME RIGHT NOW!""

The paperclip gets goosebumps, mostly from fear, but also from the cold water too. ""I...I'm attached to a really strong line! You'd have to break the line first, and by that time, you'd be fished from the water!""

""I'VE BROKEN LINES MADE OF CARBON NANOTUBE,"" the largemouth bass gloated. ""NO MATERIAL OR METHOD CAN IMPEDE MY CONSUMPTION OF THE BAIT.""

The line twists and felts, mostly from fear, but also from the cold water too. ""Even if you do break me, I'm not hypoallergenic! You could have a serious allergic reaction.""

The largemouth bass swims around the baited hook in contemplation. The penguin watches hungrily from above. After a few moments, the bass opens its maw, and lunges towards the bait. The worm is sucked from the hook and proceeds into the bass's gizzard, while the hook becomes lodged in its cheek. The penguin jerks the fishing pole upward securing the catch, and lifts the largemouth bass from the water.

The penguin leans in close to the bass's large green eye. ""Hello, I'm a penguin, and I eat largemouth bass.""

The largemouth bass shrinks its mouth around the line, below the Planck length of 1.6 x 10\^-35 m.

^(""Oh, is that so?"")

Upon measurement from the penguin, uncertainty in the bass's velocity exceeds the speed of light as predicted by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The bass is torn from reality itself, severing the line. As the bass's mouth returns to normal size, it manifests underwater in a world orbiting an alien sun. Unfortunately, when the hook and attached line reach the fish's gizzard, the fish has an allergic reaction to the wool and dies.

The bait, hook, line, and bass go to heaven and meet St. Peter at the pearly gates.

""Why should I let you in to heaven?"" asks St. Peter.

""I'm a sentient gummy worm, the fancy sugar coated kind,"" says the worm. St. Peter lets the worm into heaven.

""I'm a sentient paperclip hook, the fancy grooved kind,"" says the hook. St. Peter lets the hook into heaven, where it penetrates the worm, resuming its natural place within the bait.

""I'm a sentient strand of wool, the fancy superwash merino kind,"" says the line. St. Peter lets the line into heaven, where it ties itself around the hook, restoring the trinity of bait, hook, and line.

""I'M A LARGEMOUTH BASS, AND I EAT SUGAR-COATED GUMMY WORMS, GROOVED PAPERCLIP HOOKS, AND SUPERWASH MERINO WOOL LINES.""

""Oh, is that so?"" says St. Peter, as his cranium opens to project a hologram of the bass's sub-Planck length mouth from moments earlier. The bass is cast down to hell where it befriends Max Planck and Werner Heisenberg, and lives happily ever after.",67

It is December 24th and Santa Claus is doing his rounds,"On his rounds, he arrives at a giant house in Green Bay, WI. It's a beautiful, large house.

Santa creeps in, ready to drop two shiny new Amazon Fire HD 10 Tablets for the two kids who live at the property (according to the National Elf Network).

As he is putting the packages down under the giant trees in the living room, 6 foot 3 Homelander walks into the living room and screams ""*What the fuck do you think you're doing in my cousin's house?!*""

""*Jesus! I'm Santa Claus! I-*""

Homelander then zips across the room in 7 milliseconds and grabs Mr Claus by the fur on his coat and flies out to the Sea of Japan in 18 milliseconds, where he then drops Santa Claus into the ocean who then promptly drowns and dies.

Homelander then pops down into Paris (France) and has a late-night beer.

A Man Walks Into a Bar,"However, he leaves as soon as he enters. More Antiantijokes need to end like this. The man only left because it was crowded in there, from all the ""Walks into a bar"" Antiantijokes there are. Just because an infinite number of mathematicians can fit into the bar doesn't mean it should contain an infinite number of individuals. For fucks sake people, there's only a single Bartender, how's he supposed to tend to all the patrons in there.

Anyways, the bartender, sick of tending to all the patrons in the bar, pulled out a gun with an infinite amount of ammunition, and shot himself in the head. The first of a set of an infinite number of mathematicians took his place. However, after doing the math, the mathematician came to the conclusion that tending to all the patrons was mathematically impossible. He picked up the gun, but the second of a set of an infinite number of mathematicians asked how he knew he was the first of a set of an infinite number of mathematicians, and not, say for example the seven hundred twenty six nonillion three hundred twenty nine octillion five hundred seventy two heptillion six hundred fifty eight hexillion seven hundred forty seven quintillion two hundred eighteen quadrillion seventy one trillion four hundred six billion nine hundred ninety nine million six hundred and sixty sixth mathematician. The first mathematician, confused at how the second came up with such a small number, told him that the numbering system was completely arbitrary; he's the first because he decided he would be the lowest numbered mathematician, and the second is the second, because he was the first mathematician he saw that wasn't himself. The first mathematician then shoots himself in the head, leaving the second mathematician to become the first.

The new first mathematician comes to the same mathematical conclusion that the previous, being that it would be mathematically  impossible to serve every patron in the bar. He picked up the gun, but the new second of a set of an infinite number of mathematicians asks how he knows he's the first of a set of an infinite number of mathematicians, and not yet another arbitrarily small number. The first mathematician gives the same answer as the previous first mathematician, then shoots himself in the head.

This cycle continues until we reach the final first of a set of an infinite number of mathematicians. He comes to the same conclusion the previous infinity mathematicians about serving all the patrons being impossible, and picks up the gun. However, since there is no new second mathematician to ask him how he knows he's the first mathematician, and not some arbitrarily small number, he is able to answer the question by stating that he's the only mathematician left from the set of an infinite number of mathematicians, and puts the gun down.

There is, however, a second unique set of an infinite number of mathematicians in the bar. The first mathematician from the previous set attempts to use the gun to shoot them all, but discovers that the gun is out of ammunition. The first mathematician of the second set of an infinite number of mathematicians asks for 1 beer, the second asks for half a beer, the third asks for a quarter of a beer. The first mathematician from the first set of an infinite number of mathematicians puts 2 beers on the counter, and tell the infinite number of mathematicians to split the beer among themselves. The first mathematician from the first set of an infinite number of mathematicians the exits the bar.

The first mathematician encounters the man who walked into the bar earlier, but left, and tells the man that there are an infinite and one fewer people in the bar, so it should be far less crowded. The man then walks into the bar, and finds an infinite number of dead people lying at the counter. He tries to order a beer, but finds there are no bartenders. He finds the set of an infinite number of mathematicians arguing over who's the nine hundred twenty seven billion six hundred ninety two million eight hundred six thousand and twenty seventh mathematician, and who's the nine hundred twenty seven billion six hundred ninety two million eight hundred six thousand and twenty eighth mathematician. The man kindly asks the set of an infinite number of mathematicians where the bartender went. The four hundred sixty seventh mathematician tells him that the bartender's had his limit, and does not exist.",63
"""Where do you see yourself in 20 days?""","asked the interviewer.

""Well,"" I began, ""that is a very good question."" I took a long sip from my glass of water, which I had already nearly emptied. ""But I'm afraid I cannot answer it—you see, I don't have twenty-twenty vision.""

The interviewer screwed up his face. ""Excuse me?""

""It's simple, really—were you to direct your gaze to the electronic watch strapped on your forearm you would surely realize that the date is December 12th, 2019. Twenty days from now would be January 1st, 2020, a date within the year 2020. Funnily enough I have excellent eyesight, surely surpassing 20/20, but that is not essential for the joke to work. Both the name of the year 2020 and the visual acuity measure 20/20 are pronounced twenty-twenty, thus a play on words can be sculpted by expressing the lack of 20/20 vision as an inability to foresee events within the year 2020.""

""Oh.""

He laughed. I laughed. Eventually I got the job and after the interview I took him to my place and we had rough, passionate sex.

Three weeks later, the Times Square Ball dropped, and at that moment, the world changed forever.

Let me ask you a question: how many people have 20/20 vision, without corrective measures? The answer is about 35% of all people. Let me ask you another question: how many people, including those with corrective measures, have 20/20 vision? The answer is about 75% of people. Let me ask you one more question: what if, for an entire year, 25% of humanity went completely blind, and another 40% had to rely on corrective measures to see at all? The answer is that would be absurd and ridiculous.

And yet, against all odds, it happened.

At first, of course, there was mass panic, but soon those who could still see attempted to make sense of the ordeal. Millions of blinded people were helped to their homes, to their soft couches, and they sat and listened to the TV for further information from the news. Each government addressed this issue slightly differently, and because of this a war would have surely started had it not been for the fact that a good portion of their troops could not see.

Most of the still-seeing people, often called the Seers, tried the best they could to assist the blinded ones, or the Blindmen. Factories amped up production of eyeglasses and contact lenses, and they were distributed wholesale. This saved quite a few of them, but there were still some for whom the corrective measures simply didn't do much.

By March, a great social division was starting to develop. The Blindmen protested to lower the prices of corrective measures, which were currently soaring. These protests, that were led by Blindmen for Blindmen, unfortunately didn't do much, although they enabled some of the Seers to criticize their actions. According to these extremists, the Blindmen should simply stay at home and wait for the year to pass. Despite the ridiculousness of these opinions, because they were broadcasted on television, they began spreading like wildfire, even among the politicians.

By June, a majority of Seers held contempt for the Blindmen, and protests against them were held in public. Seers complained that idle Blindmen filled the cities and blocked traffic, and demanded they stay in their homes where they cannot be harmed and they cannot harm others. Congress was gradually pressured, and eventually forced, to pass a new law, requiring that Blindmen do not leave their homes on weekends. Food would be delivered to these homes by various philanthropic foundations, though the support for even these was beginning to wane.

By August, only a minority of Seers were still in support of Blindmen. More bills were passed by Congress, demanding of Blindmen to only work from their homes, later revoking their right to equal pay, and eventually completely forbidding their employment. Some establishments ignored the law and hired Blindmen anyway, providing them food and shelter, but these were few and far between.

By September, the Blindmen were beginning to disappear from their homes. This at first caused public unease, but over the course of the weeks the reaction to these disappearances grew quieter. When it was discovered that the government was responsible for them, few people took this seriously, and by the end of the month, some Seers even encouraged this.

By October, the Seers began breaking into Blindman homes and kidnapping the Blindmen, often taking their belongings as well. A number of cases of slavery arose, though the public eye seemed less and less concerned about them. Soon many Seer families shared a Blindman or Blindmen amongst themselves, usually to perform simple tasks that didn't require vision like scrubbing the windows or doing the dishes. Later they were also used for mindless entertainment, and eventually for sexual conquest.

By November, many eyeglass factories were being shut down, in hopes of preventing the possibility of revolution. Existing eyeglasses were smashed en masse, and well-respected Seers who wore glasses or contact lenses transformed overnight into sex slaves for those who simply chose them. No longer could you take off your glasses at night—they had always to be on your person, lest their protection might one day vanish and you will be left helpless against humanity.

By December, hatred against Blindmen and support of their enslavement had grown near unanimous among the Seers. Even most of the Blindmen themselves had accepted this fate, simply agreeing that they were an inferior race not worthy of experiencing the pleasures of life. The Seers became the Sirs, and the Blindmen became the Bondmen.

And thus concluded the year of 2020. You might be interested to know what happened after that—how did the Blindmen react to their eyesight suddenly returning? What about the Seers? Did a massive revolution occur followed by a total collapse of the government, or did the Seers manage to suppress them completely?

These are all very good questions,"" I say, taking a long sip from my half-emptied glass of water, ""but I'm afraid I cannot answer them—you see, I don't have 20/21 vision.""

"The Garlic Festival in Lawton, OK","I was at the annual Garlic Festival in Lawton the other day with my two buds, when we all saw this hot, athletic-looking brunette walking past. She looked about 18 or 19 and was wearing a fairly tight top and shorts.

196 people died that day in Lawton and a further 349 folks were injured. Oklahoma's worst tragedy for decades.

On yet another day of divorce proceedings, Darius is making his way to yet another hearing when he slips on the steps leading to the courthouse and smashes his head on the pavement. He is pronounced dead at the scene.

They've been tasked with putting together a data summary of the frequency of internet searches related to ""possible terrorism"" and ""potential terrorism"".

They found that the search term ""fertilizer bomb"" has been searched 1,117,967 times this month, up 6.23% from last month's searches of the same term.

The second most searched for thing (related to ""possible terrorism"" and ""potential terrorism"" of course) was ""gas station bombing"", which was searched 892,022 times, up 19.82% from last month.

Coming in at a close third was ""petrol bomb"", which was searched 891,289 times, up 39.66% from last month.

Brad, Brogan and Brock's boss stressed that he ""rather preferred"" bar charts, so Brock, Brad and Brogan's data summary made heavy use of bar charts.

Rather strangely, some may think, firearms-related internet searches were excluded in this department. Monitoring of *that* would require a whole other giant data center in the middle of nowhere.

A busy day here at the NSA complex in Bluffdale, AZ, a very busy day indeed...",25
There was a fire drill at the Utah Data Center today...,"Coincidental, considering that the drill occurred at the exact same time the Washington Post site crashed due to ""an unusual amount of traffic"".

A second unusual day at the NSA Complex in Bluffdale, AZ...",2
"A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?""","The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound—a kind of soft hum, barely there, hovering at the edge of his aural horizon. After some time, he decides to investigate.

Wandering the halls, the man wonders to himself, why did the monks so readily accept his presence? Is it mere monksmanship, or perhaps have they some deeper factor to conceal? Who is this man, anyway?

The hum grows closer as he nears the exit, and a vague celeste gleam lies upon the tiles. There, beyond the archway, a being of sorts stands and smiles at his approach. He smiles back.

""Come along with me,"" the being whispers. The man awaits further elaboration, but that appears to be the spirit's only request.

It turns to ramble the marble path set along the steep outline of the monastery. A peculiar yet warm feeling, almost like levitating over a summery shore, cocoons the man, and prods him forward in pursuit of the visitant. As he makes his way past the boulders, this feeling grows somewhat heavier, so that once he crosses the last stepping stone, there is no doubt in his mind that his feet cannot feel the ground.

Across the road is a vast forest, trees numerous like stars in the night. The spirit wanders yonder, and the man feels as if he's no choice but to wander along. His feet do not take him; surely, the breeze carries him forth. And as he ambles into the woods in wonderment, his consciousness diffuses among the waves—a state between living and dreaming—and he feels that he and the spirit are the only realities in the universe, and the trees and the stones and the monastery form the canvas upon which their figures are painted.

The being pauses over a raised glade, and turns to face the man. It smiles. He smiles back, perhaps instinctively. The feeling of floating turns surreal, and the languor grows ever so fervent, rising, flying, approaching the infinite. The spirit wanders nearer. It all closes in. This is it. This is it. This is—

""Good morning.""

He opens his eyes. Streaks of sunlight wander through the monastery window, falling on the monk who stirred him awake. The man glances about as the feeling rapidly falls away.

""What… what…""

""We fixed your car,"" the monk continues. ""I trust you should be on your way soon, but if you'd like breakfast, it's in the main hall.""

He leaves before the man can say another word. Blurry and perplexed, he slips into his yesterday getup and staggers to the main hall, where the monks have already begun enjoying their morning monk rations. Wishing at the least for an early snack, the man pours himself a bowl of soup and sits at a table beside some other monks. It is difficult to ascertain their religion, he notices; they all wear drab clothes fastened by hastily crafted belts, and some of them wear simple sandals while some walk barefooted. The monastery itself, too, was quite plain in appearance—no statues or lettering chiseled into the stone walls, just pleasant aesthetic patterns and the odd pillar. He has to wonder if these monks even worship any sort of higher being, or if they are simply generic monks cleverly designed so as not to suggest any religious behavior other than an unexplained aura of mystery. But why? Is there some grander purpose to all this nonsense?

He turns to one of the monks sitting at his side. ""So, what do you guys do? As monks?""

Fortunately disregarding the bluntness of the inquiry, the monk smiles. ""I'm afraid I can't tell you, Mr. Carmichael. You are not a monk.""

""Huh. Is it a secret?""

""Secrets are few and far between these days.""

""Is that a yes?""

""Patience is the key to all doors, my friend.""

""W-what?""

""A true monk knows the blue girl is—""

""Okay, I get it."" Mr. Carmichael returns to his soup, a somber unknowing plaguing his mind. And yet, there's still the matter of… ""Wait. Did you say the blue girl?""

The monk eyes him with mild interest.

""I think I saw her yesterday, in the night. It must've been a dream, and yet I recall it so vividly I am sure it couldn't have been one. She took me to the forest, and… well, that's as far as I can remember."" He waits for the monk to respond, but he simply nods. ""Who is she?""

""I cannot say, Mr. Carmichael. You are not a monk.""

Reluctantly, Mr. Carmichael abandons the discussion and finishes his soup. The car has been fixed quite skillfully, in spite of the fact that, being monks, the monks likely held no prior experience in car repair. Nevertheless, he thanks them for their reception and aid and goes about his merry way.

Many years later, in a manner unimaginably convenient, the same exact Mr. Carmichael (of all the Mr. Carmichaels in the world, the particular one that had been there previously) is driving down the same exact road (for some oddly specific reason and notwithstanding the chance that he has moved in the intervening years) and breaks down near the same exact monastery (which still operates in the same place and practices the same beliefs, though perhaps that bit of information is less outrageous).

The same exact monks accept him, feed him, even fix his same exact car. When he lies to sleep, the same exact hum he had heard oh so long ago in the same exact place keeps him awake once more. He recognizes the sound at once, and the memory of the blue girl retakes him. Almost as if by their own accord, his legs leave the linen bed and seek the source, and soon they find themselves before her. She smiles. He smiles back.

""I must show you,"" she says. That's all she said, before turning once again to the walkway.

Mr. Carmichael follows her once again, and when they cross the outline of that gloomy forest, a pair of crows alight behind them, almost seeming to block their retreat. *As if we have reason to leave*, Mr. Carmichael thinks with a chuckle. This is among the last thoughts his internal monologue can summon before the feeling of floating drowns it out. He nears the singularity once again.

The girl stops in the same clearing, but now in its center sits a flat object, like a thin mirror, enveloped in a thick veil of sorts. She turns to Mr. Carmichael and softly grasps the sheet, smiling with unworldly happiness. Mr. Carmichael is utterly engrossed by the veiled mirror, and then, right there—

""Good morning.""

""No…"" is the only thing he can mutter as it all falls away. ""Why…""

""Breakfast's in the main hall.""

""…why… why… why…""

The monks sit with him in the main hall, but he chooses to keep some distance this time, in hopes of avoiding eccentric discourse. Yet, the soup cannot provide him company for long, and he eventually succumbs to the mortal want of society.

""Hey, uh, have we met before?""

The monk looks up. ""Yes, I think so.""

""I saw her again.""

""Hm.""

""Can you please just tell me who she is? I *must* know. Her visions plague me, and I have spent countless nights pondering her.""

""As I've said, Mr. Carmichael, I cannot tell you, for you are not a monk.""

""Well… if I were a monk, would you tell me?""

""There would be no need, for you would already know.""

""Then how? How do I become a monk?""

The monk raises an eyebrow. ""You would consider?""

He leans forward, his face darkening in the cinematic lighting. ""I would do anything and more, sir. Nothing seems more desirable to me.""

The monk contemplates him for a minute, then sighs. ""The journey to monkhood is a long and treacherous one. You must surrender everything you know about yourself. You must forget that you are Mr. Carmichael, for beyond the Three Tasks, you are not. You must leave your past life, for it shall be null if you succeed. Are you ready for such a sacrifice, Mr. Carmichael? Has the girl so utterly captivated you that you are determined to abandon these things in search of the truth?""

""Yes!"" Mr. Carmichael answers sharply, though ironically not as sure as he lets on, but comfortable enough with his response—he has no background so to speak of, or at least he can't recall it. He is just a generic, run-of-the-mill, oddly resolute straight man, almost like the protagonist of some long-winded joke. As such, he has little reason to deny such a life-changing offer.

""Then it shall be done,"" says the monk. ""Follow down the path outside the monastery, to the Lake of Wisdom. Master Uru will be there. Go to him, and he will guide you to monkhood.""

Wasting no time besides the little needed to finish his soup, Mr. Carmichael hurries out of the monastery, descending the steep walkway leading down the mountainside. The journey is long and treacherous, but after what must be many hours, he finally approaches a colorful shore, his parched throat yearning for water.

An old man sits motionless on the beach, dressed in the same drab clothes as the monks. Mr. Carmichael hesitantly nears him, full of awe at the so-called Master. He stops some distance behind him, expecting him to say some wise remark without so much as twitching a muscle, but the old man remains silent. How mystical!

But some minutes pass, and the old man has still yet to utter a word. Is he really building the suspense for this long?

""Uhh…"" Mr. Carmichael uhhs.

""Oh, shit!"" The old man jumps and swings around. ""How long have you been standing there?!""

""Er… a few minutes?""

""Jesus, give me a warning next time!""

""I thought you heard my footsteps.""

""Well, I don't have the best hearing, do I?""

""Erm…""

""I…"" Master Uru's face relaxes abruptly. ""I'm sorry. I get a little anxious sometimes. I understand you've come here because you wish to attain monkhood.""

""Yes, that is my want.""

""Very well. A true monk possesses three qualities most important: wisdom, fidelity, and celibacy. These qualities are tested to their limits in the sacred Three Tasks, which you must complete to achieve the status of a monk. The difficulty of each Task is exponentially larger than the previous—if you are not definite on your goal, leave now, and no harm will come to you. This will not be the case later on. Is that understood?""

Mr. Carmichael nods.

""Now, the first Task is simple—before you lies the Lake of Wisdom."" He gestures at the vast lake. ""When you become a monk, you will not be infinitely wise at first, but it is essential that when you do acquire this wisdom, you will know how to use it. If you drink of the Lake's waters, you will, for a time, possess such wisdom. Now, what is your name?""

""Nathan.""

""Nathan, walk to the Lake and partake of its wisdom.""

Nathan walks to the lake and partakes of its wisdom, taking deep gulps to wet his crisp throat. His eyes open, and all the knowledge he needs is at his fingertips.

""Now, Nathan, I will ask of you a simple question. Take as much time as you need, but do note that the effects of the water wear off after a time. So, here it is: How many pebbles do you see?""

Pebbles. Area of vision is a circle with horizon the boundary. Horizon is 2.9 miles away—area is 2π×2.9²≈52.8416 square miles. Look down. Basic measure—the foot. Assume length of 1 foot, and ratio of width to length 1:3—area of foot is about a third of a square foot. 5,280 feet in a mile—27,878,400 square feet in a square mile. Times 52.8416 is about 1,473,138,939 square feet. How many pebbles under a foot? Count—1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. Density of pebbles is 22 pebbles per third of square foot. Multiply by 1,473,138,939 square feet—97,227,169,972 pebbles. Seems too high—how much downsizing is permitted? Saw around 200 monks in monastery, oldest being about 90 years. Road adjacent to monastery is scarcely visited, maybe twice a day—65,700 visits since oldest monk birth. 1,000,000 citizens in county, so probability that a citizen visited at least once is 6.3588%. Times 1,000,000 citizens is 63,588 visits, so 2,112 are returns. Assuming every repeat visitor attempts monkhood, and 200 successful monks, the chance of passing all Three Tasks is 9.469%. Let n be the fraction of pilgrims passing the first Task. Tasks grow exponentially in difficulty due to Uru, so n² of people pass the second Task, and n³ of people pass the third, so n×n²×n³=n⁶ of people pass all Tasks and become monks, which is 9.469%. Thus, n is the 6th root of 0.09469, which is about 0.6751. Thus, there must be an allowed error of 67.51%—times the previously calculated pebble number, 97,227,169,972, is the lowest correct answer:

""65,641,272,526.""

""Well done. You have passed the first Task successfully. You are now ready to continue to the second."" Master Uru points to his left. ""Head north, towards the Mountain of Fidelity, and seek Master Zolath's camp. He will give you further directions if you show him this certificate."" He hands him a small plastic card, imprinted upon which are the words *APPROVED BY MASTER URU*. ""Take care, Nathan.""

And so, Nathan takes off to that great Mountain of Fidelity that looms in the distance. The journey is long and treacherous, but eventually, he arrives at the foot of the mountain and sees a pillar of smoke climbing from the roof of a large tent. Weary and fatigued, he parts the flaps and peeks inside. A cloaked figure sits there before the fire, warming its hands. He steps inside.

""Nathan Carmichael,"" she says motionlessly.

Impressive. Nathan feels not the need to ask her how she knows his name, for he deems it quite natural for a monk, no less a Master-monk.

""I've Master Uru's certificate."" He tries to hand her the card, but she is too focused on the fire.

""Then you are ready.""

She beckons to him, and he sits before the fire.

""Here."" She hands him a plastic bottle of water, which he readily accepts. On a closer glance, he realizes that she is not merely thawing her palms—rather, she is coaxing the fire, kneading the hot air that surrounds it. To what occasion, he cannot tell.

""You must be Master Zolath,"" Nathan speaks, and beneath the hood of her cloak he swears he glimpses the shadow of a grin.

""Yes. The wind has led me here. It whispers the fates of all, and soon, I hope, you will learn its language.""

""Woah. That's profound.""

""Yes. Now, reach into the flame.""

""What?""

""Reach forward, into the heart of the blaze, and retrieve your torch.""

Nathan scratches his head. ""Right, I get that you lot like being mystical, but what actually do you intend?""

""I hide my words beneath no layers, Nathan. Send your hand into the flame—I shall keep it dormant in the meantime.""

Well, this woman sure looks wise and powerful. Perhaps she truly knows the ways of the fires. Resting on this notion, Nathan shuts his eyes and sends a tentative hand through the sparks. The heat stings, but he can tell that he is safe. After a bit of feeling around his fingers happen on a long thin cylinder, which he interprets to be the aforementioned torch. He holds a tight grasp and retrieves it from the fire, and in his hand he finds, indeed, a wooden torch, with a flame dancing on its end.

""This torch you hold now shall guide you through the second Task. Bring it atop the Mountain of Fidelity, where Grandmaster Venus shall accept it. Take heed, for the air over the Mountain is cold and tempestuous. You must remember to keep the torch ablaze throughout the journey, no matter the price.""

""And if the torch is to extinguish?"" (Nathan is starting to get the hang of monkspeak.)

""Then you shall meet a fate most unfortunate.""

""What does that mean?""

""Who can tell? Any concrete knowledge of such a scenario would imply some level of control, which we clearly do not possess.""

Nathan nods, though he is not sure what she means.

""Now go—lest the flame dies early.""

He gets on his feet and heads outside, firmly grasping the burning torch.

""And remember,"" shouts Master Zolath from beyond the folds, ""keep the torch aflame *at all costs!*""

And so, Nathan sets out to conquer the mighty Mountain of Fidelity, which now suddenly seems fifty stories taller than earlier. Having little experience (none, in fact) with mountain climbing, the idea at first startles him. The cold wind lashes at him, threatening the life of the flame, which he is to somehow bring to the peak alive. How would such an endeavor even be feasible, let alone possible?

Yet, after a few minutes of scaling, Nathan seems to have happened upon the answer. The Mountain of Fidelity, certainly, had to be named aptly, for the second Task does require for any physical capabilities. All Nathan has to do is remain loyal to the torch and do all that is in his power to keep its flame alive. And surely the Task does not call for any further indulgence; to prove his fidelity he must only remain loyal.

Indeed, this thought process is correct, but, once the wind begins howling, and the flame starts flickering, he panics.

""No, no, no!"" He tries to hold still, so that the fire suffers less movement, but he cannot help it. The torchlight wanes, and soon there is but smolder in its place.

*What am I to do?!* Nathan thinks monkly. *Think, man, think!*

All he needs to do is stay loyal, but how can loyalty help him here?

*""Keep the torch aflame at all costs! (costs, costs, costs…)""*

There must be a way. There must be a way. There must—

That's it!

Nathan takes off his shirt, exposing his muscular torso to the elements. Ignoring the shivers, he wraps it around the smoldering top of the torch, which after a few tense moments catches fire and returns to its flaming state.

And now, standing shirtless on the mountainside, and spotting a thick layer of ice up ahead, Nathan realizes the true meaning of fidelity.

The fabric of the shirt keeps the flame busy for a time, and Nathan keeps it close to his chest as he enters the snowy portion of the mountain. He must be close to the end, he thinks—surely it can't get much colder than this.

But after a while of climbing icy boulders and trudging through the snow, the flame flickers again. Shivering and groaning, Nathan looks around for something to feed it, but the ground is cold and barren. The fire has burnt through the shirt, and now asks for more. He contemplates this for a minute, and recalls what he told himself near the foot of the mountain—the Task asks for nought but his undying loyalty. If he provides this loyalty, he shall surely pass it alive.

So he removes his trousers and stuffs them on the tip of the torch, which, again, soon flickers back into life. Now he is left only in his nonflammable sandals and his unfortunately flammable underpants, which he prays not to have to use.

He goes forward, shaking against the biting wind, but nevertheless determined to fulfill this Task. At this point he can barely remember what the purpose of all this is. The wind shrieks at his ears, and the gelid air envelopes his naked body, almost repressing his movement. The question of mortality creeps into his mind, but he tosses it aside—he feels he does not know enough to tackle it. He only knows that he must prove his fidelity, no matter the cost.

Soon, he spots a wooden building in the distance, sitting just at the edge of the fog. It is far, but the distance is finite, and that is all that matters now. Nathan glances at the torch, and to his horror, finds that it has already finished consuming his trousers. They lasted only a little longer than the shirt. He looks at the house—it is much too far away, and even if he were to make a run for it, the resulting wind would surely extinguish the flame in mere seconds.

So, of course, he takes off his underpants and wraps them around the torch, and the flame lives on. His body is shaking uncontrollably, and surely if he doesn't make it to the house soon, he will die. But if he runs too hastily, and the fire is to vanish before he gets there, it will all have been useless.

He walks steadily, not too quickly and hopefully not too slowly, though the constant quivering of his body makes it hard for him to verify these assumptions. He holds the torch close, but he knows the underpants won't last for long. Nathan doesn't have much self-esteem, as you can tell.

His vision turns blurry, and he stumbles forward. The house must be getting closer, but it seems still so far away. At this point he has lost all feeling all around his body, and the rest of his senses gradually fade away as well. He steps forward, but his foot doesn't land on anything. At first he assumes his feet have simply lost feeling as well, but a few moments later, when he hears a dull shatter and the air suddenly turns much colder, he realizes something is wrong. His eyes open, and he finds himself suspended in water, the torch having left his grasp and lying on the edge of the icy lake.

*Oh, fuck,* is the only thing he can think, before everything goes dark.

…

For a moment, nothing happens. Nathan's only thought is, ""I have died."" There is no emotion accompanying this statement, because it is just a simple truth. He isn't afraid, nor sad, nor angry. He is dead. That is all.

But after a while, he thinks of Descartes. He can't recall what Descartes had said, but he knows that if he can think of Descartes, that means he must exist. That's a rule of thumb he'd heard from someone. And if he must exist, then he must still somehow be alive—QED.

So, if he is alive, there must be something he can mold with his imagination. So he fancies a teapot, and it materializes before him, stark against the blank void all around. He fancies a teacup, and a teaspoon, and perhaps a few teacubes of teasugar, and it all appears to him. *Neat,* he thinks, pouring himself a cuppa.

Next, he imagines a hot bath, and, realizing he is missing a body, imagines himself a hunky physique, imagines himself its occupier, and imagines his figure lying in the bathtub. But he still feels rather lonely, what with the infinite nothingness in all directions, so he imagines that the bathtub sits on the ledge of an expensive villa, overlooking some Scandinavian landscape. He sighs and leans back as a draft passes by. A wooded region sits near the villa, separating it from the distant mountain range, and there near the edge a crow alights on a branch. All is well.

And yet, something bothers him. He did not imagine the crow. He has no reason to even think of crows. And now, the crow takes off and lands on the edge of his bathtub, unnaturally close to him. That he most certainly did not intend.

""ᮿᒔኻАዼჽ᫞ᛵᾅнᄩᓳ᫘ሲЇᐷዏᰜᬛДᯌᒋዡЮ᷿ᡵᩭᝳ"" quoth the crow.

""W-what?""

""ᣠᄚኛὍЅቴዡፙዔᇀᰊᱹ᫹""

""What does that mean?!""

The crow eyes him more intently. ""Repent.""

That word resonates in his fancy, ricocheting off and shattering every one of his hopes and dreams. The crow thus flies off as the world so recklessly sculpted by Nathan rapidly withers away. Then, for what must be years and years, Nathan feels nothingness. But unlike the nothingness he experienced earlier, which he saw through the comforting lens of subconsciousness, this nothingness is pure and raw, and for the first time in his life he is filled with total, unadulterated terror. And the world follows his lead, and suddenly there is cold ground beneath him, and the next moment it's gone. It has never even thought to exist. He has always been falling down, faster and faster, past universes and worlds that only exist as backgrounds for some greater web of mysticism. He sees himself for the speck he is, in the imagination of another speck in the imagination of a young man, who is a meaningless speck in a gigantic universe that is probably a speck of fanciful thinking engendered by some other speck of meaninglessness. One of these specks must exist in reality, he is certain, but is it necessarily the last one in the seemingly unending cascade? Is it even the only one? Is there such a speck at all?

As if to avoid the question altogether, the Engine appears before him, one of those many tiny specks magnified to seem more significant than it is. It's a simple function, really—take as input some array of experiences and stories, process them in some mysterious fashion, and output new stories and worlds. A self-replicating particle, and this is only one of its infinite variations. On one side sits hearsay of a mysterious frozen continent—on the other, a young girl who must save the world. On one side, a boy glancing at a girl he likes—on the other, a recursive encounter between a bartender and a customer. On one side, a silly joke about monks that gets reposted to r/Jokes every 2 months—and Nathan sits on the other.

And somewhere in the midst of this process sits the crow.

Nathan turns around, and finds an infinite row of such Engines, each just subtly different than the rest, all being fed endless romances, tragedies and comedies, and spitting out unique, tiny universes. One speaks of a pair of atoms flirting with each other; another, giant metallic behemoths hissing in the distance; and another, a malevolent god-like being learning the power of love. And somehow, perching on some motionless cogwheel, the crow oversees them all.

""The clock ticks, thou Carmichael,"" croaks the crow.

Indeed, the ticking grows louder, and the flame wanes. It echoes about his head. But surely, he is still in control! The scene before him is merely a drawing on a curtain, which he promptly tears apart. But beyond the curtain, the crow perches on a pedestal, looking down woefully.

""The choice is yours.""

Behind the crow is a large door, through which a cold gray light illuminates the entrance. As the ticking grows, he realizes that the door won't last forever. In due course he will have to decide if he wishes to abandon these infinite powers and return to his reality. For what? What does the real world hold over the infinitely-plastic universe within his own mind? Beyond the doorway, nothing has purpose. Everything is for it is. But here, he himself assigns everything a purpose, and thus all that he begets has massive significance.

Though, is the real world any different? Does nothing have significance if we do get to choose what significance even is? Is that power not inherent to all people?

Then there's the question of control. Within this world, if he says ""let there be light,"" then light be there let. But out there, saying ""let there be light,"" the most he will get is a curious glare from some nearby stranger. In here, his powers have no limit—but out there, is he anything but powerless?

And he recalls the Engine. A machine cannot operate without input. A self-propelled self-replicator is as good as a cancer cell. For the Engine to run it needs to see, to hear, to feel. If the Engine has nothing to feed on, it will never be able to create anything. It will remain forever stuck within its own thoughts, which will either be non-existent or unpredictably chaotic. And a man forever stuck with his own thoughts and nothing more, doubtless, is doomed to degrade to a similar fate.

He needs input. He needs to see, and to hear, and to feel. He needs warmth, and sadness, and touch, and hatred, and love and joy and wonder. And all lies beyond that door.

So he walks through.

…

Nathan opens his eyes. His naked body is submerged in near-frozen water, and with all the senses he still has he can only faintly detect the intense cold biting at his skin.

He swims out of the lake and gasps deep of the icy air. The torch is still sitting there, burning faintly. Quaking uncontrollably, he snatches it and hastily makes his way towards the house in the distance. At this point, Nathan can hardly complain, even in his own head, about the severity of the situation. He seems to have lost that part of him, and whatever is left only urges him to keep going.

When he reaches the door, he cannot bother to knock. He simply leans on the knob and pushes through, falling on the matted floor with a thud.

The warmth within instantly thaws him; a little too quickly for his liking, in fact. His senses have not returned to him yet, and now the only thing he feels is a tingling sensation all across his skin.

""Argh,"" he arghs, struggling to stir.

Eventually, he hears the door closing behind him, and someone pulls him up and drags him away, although he can only assume this from his foggy vision as he still can't otherwise feel a thing. The stranger sits him down, and the thawing grows somewhat quicker. His vision sharpens a bit, and he can make out a figure pouring a mug, which it then promptly puts to Nathan's lips. ""Drink.""

Nathan holds it in his pale fingers. ""W-w-wh…""

""Drink it. Quickly.""

He gulps the liquid down his throat and coughs. ""What is this?""

""Coffee.""

""Oh."" He takes another gulp, and his senses start coming back. Now he can see the room more clearly. There's a fireplace in front of him, and within it a flame, dancing and crackling happily. On the walls he finds a pair of old-fashioned windows, through which a vast view of a green valley shines, and in the same wall a glass door provides entrance to a marble balcony. Nathan finds himself sat on a crimson couch, some distance from the fireplace, and his feet in a tub of hot water. In an opposite crimson couch sits a tall man, draped in simple monk clothes, inspecting him with intrigue.

""How do you feel?"" the man asks.

""Mm… better."" Nathan looks down and realizes that he is still naked. His mind is too fuzzy for this to embarrass him, but he would feel better not exposed to the air. ""Do you have a blanket?""

The man smiles. ""Monk code requires that a candidate remain bare until the third Task.""

""Oh.""

""But yes, I should have a blanket somewhere.""

The man gets up and rummages through some cabinets on the other side of the room, and after a minute finds a white sheet which he tosses onto Nathan's body.

""Thank you."" He takes another gulp of his coffee. ""You're Grandmaster Venus, right?""

The man chuckles. ""So she told you, I trust?""

Nathan nods slowly.

""It seems she's grown fond of confusing you lot."" He sits back down and smiles. ""I'm Master Zolath. The woman you met at the foot of the mountain is Grandmaster Venus. She swapped our names for her amusement.""

""Oh. But what about Master Uru? He told me I'd meet Zolath at the tent.""

""Yes, perhaps we should bring him up to date."" Master Zolath pours himself a cup of coffee. ""We were originally swapped. I was the guide for the second Task, and Venus was here, for the third Task, this House of Celibacy. I think you can imagine why she wished to swap places.""

""Mhm.""

""So now I am in charge of this burden, which for my sake and… well, probably for yours, too—although I don't judge—I'd rather we just sit here for however long you're required to… er, 'resist.'""

He nods in agreement.

""So what is your name?""

""Oh, uh, Nathan. I thought you'd already know. You know, being a Master and whatnot.""

""No, no, unfortunately. Only the Grandmaster holds such mystical powers.""

Nathan takes another sip, nearly emptying his mug. ""Well, I've come this far—could you perhaps indulge me in the fabled secrets of the monks?""

""Only when you become a monk.""

""When will that be?""

""In about…"" He surveys his watch. ""4 minutes. Not doing too bad. How are you feeling, Nathan?""

""Well."" The feeling has almost fully returned to his fingers.

""Can you walk?""

""I'll try."" He draws his feet from the hot water and places them on the floor. The joy of warmth subsides quite tragically and the skin longs for the past, but otherwise he is fine. He ties the blanket about his neck, stands up with a deep groan, and steps along the carpet for a minute. ""Yeah.""

""Good."" Master Zolath sets his cup on the table and gets on his feet. ""I'd like to tell you some words in private."" He gestures at the balcony.

""Outside?""

""If it's not too much trouble.""

They step out onto the overhang, where the air is significantly colder, and yet, with the blanket, liveable. The valley is spread out before them, glimmering joyfully in the reflections of the sinking sun, and right below them a steep walkway leads down the mountain and merges with the green.

""I take it the pond befell you,"" says Master Zolath.

""The Pond?""

""No, no, just the pond. It's no official name—everyone falls in it, so we just call it the pond.""

""Well, yes, then.""

""So you have witnessed the Engine.""

""…Yes.""

""Then you must understand that you cannot revert your path.""

""Yes. Wait, no. What do you mean?""

Master Zolath leans on the pale railing and heaves a heavy sigh. ""Nathan, over the years I have seen the views of our monastery morph about. As Masters fall and rise, the values they preach grow ever so slightly different. The pond has been crucial to this metamorphosis, and the secrets it unveiled have affected our operations significantly."" His glassy eyes rest on Nathan's. ""You've seen her, haven't you?""

Nathan hesitates for a moment, then nods vaguely. ""Who is she?""

""The last of the mallocs. The final remnant of those that crafted the Engine.""

""What happened to the rest?""

He closes his eyes. ""The twilight fell on them.""

A tense quiet follows, and Nathan isn't really sure what to say, or how to interpret the Master's words. Surely the twilight is an allegory of some kind (or a metaphor; he never really understood the difference), and it falling on the mallocs alludes to some unfortunate fate, but which exactly, he cannot extrapolate. However, fearing disrespecting the mystical obscurity of the Master's discourse, he inquires further not.

""Nathan, I know not where the wind should take you, but if you must go on, I only ask of you one thing.""

""What's that?""

""The malloc still controls the Engine. If she is joyous, the Engine will make joy. If she is in pain, the Engine shall make pain. And pain I have seen. Such terrible, awful pain."" He turns to Nathan. ""The malloc will not live forever. And if she is to perish naturally, she will surely bring the Engine down with her. Do you understand?""

""…yes.""

""I'm sorry. It's the only way."" His eyes return to the valley. A crow alights nearby, and starts pecking at a bush. ""You're free to go, Nathan. Take the path down the mountain and to the Caldera of Ordination, where you will become a monk.""

""Thank you, Master Zolath.""

The journey to the end of the world requires arduous planning and preparation, but the journey to the Caldera of Ordination is easier. Nathan takes only a few hours to scale down the mountain, clutching his blanket tightly, but as the view of the steamy spring grows closer, his fingers gradually thaw back.

At the margin, he finds another monk, with clothes much shorter than his brethren's. He stands next to a wooden boat, and as Nathan nears him, he notices the sweat dripping from his forehead.

""You are ready,"" the monk says raspily. ""Climb in.""

He rows Nathan into the midst of the caldera, and the steam grows thick and dense, obscuring their vision. Nathan's heart is pounding restlessly, though he isn't sure if this is because of the excitement or because he has trouble breathing.

Minutes later, a small island, certainly in the dead center of the spring, emerges from beyond the steam curtains. Numerous stone structures decorate it, and circling them are a handful of monks, all wearing short monk clothes, their faces hidden by veils. They seem to be chanting something, though they might just be mindlessly humming.

""Step forward, child,"" says the monk who rowed him.

Nathan, a little irritated by his condescending address, nevertheless walks into the center of the monk circle. The steam grows even thicker, and soon he fails to witness the monks surrounding him.

""Take the blanket off your skin.""

He takes his blanket off his skin, and the steam nears and licks his naked body. The humming of the monks grows louder, and the feeling of levitating returns to his feet. He closes his eyes, and somewhere, in there, he dimly sees the light. The truth is there. It has always been there, and now he will understand it. The humming grows louder. Everything is lighting up. It's all starting to make sense. Yes, yes, this is it! This is the light! This is what it's all been for! The light is here! The light is—

**Wake up.**

What—what was that? What's going on?

**Wake up, Nathan.**

No, no, no! Everything is falling away! The light! The light is retreating! It's all shattering! Why?!

**Jesus, what did he take?!**

**Nathan!**

Everything is dying. Everything is dying. Everything is dying. And the truth is gone.

""Nathan!""

""*Shut up! Shut the fuck up!*""

He looks around, breathing heavily. There's a room. It's a small room, maybe a living room. There's a window in the corner, and a streetlight blinks beyond it some distance away. He turns his head. There are people there. Two boys at his side, and a girl sitting on the carpet, wearing headphones. They all stare at him.

It becomes apparent to him that he is the one who screamed those words.

""Are you okay?"" asks one of the boys.

""Y-yeah. Sorry.""

He looks at his companion. ""He had a bad trip.""

""Yeah, no shit, Uri!""

""What're you mad at me for? You gave him the stuff!""

""I didn't give him anything, I don't know where he got it!""

Nathan says nothing. He is too bewildered by the horrible feeling flooding his mind.

""Zack,"" the girl calls, ""check his pulse.""

The other boy pulls up Nathan's sleeve and presses a finger to his wrist. ""He's fine.""

""I need…"" Nathan murmurs.

Zack looks at him. ""What?""

""I need a breather.""

He exchanges a worried expression with Uri, who nods grimly. ""Alright.""

""Wait, he can't go!"" says the girl. ""Look at him! He's in shock! We need to—""

""Vera,"" Uri says seriously. ""Let him.""

She opens her mouth to object, but closes it a moment later and sighs.

Nathan leaves soon afterwards, entering the rainy night. The orange streetlights reflect on the pavement, breaking up and shattering into indistinct blurs. Slow, jazzy music plays in a nearby building, attentuated by the veils of time and space.

He steps into the darkness of a small alleyway, chained metal clanging at his feet. A crow lands yonder, glaring through its ebony eyes. Nathan blinks, and the alley gradually turns gray, whatever life left in it draining away so quickly. Then it stops, and all that remains is its frozen ghost, whose only physicality is being a background to a distant black car, which now approaches him. It brakes some distance away, making a terrible noise against the pavement. The crow hops onto the car and turns to him.

""Get in, thou Carmichael.""

""What? My name's not Michael.""

The crow groans, then beckons him forward. Nathan climbs into the car and sits himself comfortably against the cushioned backseat. Soon enough, an abstract landscape speeds by the window, through other worlds and times, and as this is all happening, Nathan can't help but feel empty and minute against the vast scale of it all. He is doomed to forever be a marionette in the hands of a marionette which is held in the hands of an infinite tower of strings and marionettes. That much was made clear by Master Zolath, who may or may not even exist. Which begs the question—does the monastery exist? Does the Engine exist? Does he, even, exist?

And does it really matter? If everything that can possibly exist is just a figment of imagination of imagination of imagination of imagination, does existing even have a valid definition? Is it anything more than an expression of want to be significant, or to stand out in the void?

The car stops. Beyond the window, Nathan sees woods. Thick woods, shading the bushes and plants from the dim, metal-blue sky, where pink clouds hover. Quiet. And there, in the distance, the malloc stands.

He soon finds himself at her side, almost levitating over the grass. Through the thicket he catches only glimpses of the ever so peaceful skies.

""We do not get to choose who the twilight falls upon,"" she says.

Nathan nods sympathetically.

They reach the clearing again, and in the center once more sits the veiled Mirror. The malloc stops under the shade and smiles at him. He smiles back, then walks forward, towards the Mirror. His heart races, his hands shake, and he realizes that the truth may still be out there, after all.

He pulls the veil, and—",173

A goat came into my place of work today,"I work in my downstairs bathroom counting the individual splashes of water that appear on the floor from the various appliances, i.e. the bathtub, the shower, the toilet, the sink etc. I measure the number, the size, and how long the splashes take to evaporate (which can be several hours during the winter). Splashes invariably occur from collisions between water and the people using the appliances, say my family or me, more often than not.

Now, I know what you're thinking, what about when me or my family get out of the bath and water drops from our bodies on to the floor, do those splashes count? Do I count large pools of water? If two drops join, do I count them as one drop or two? Well, yes, the answers you suspect for those questions are indeed correct. I make a reasonable living doing what I do and I enjoy the challenges, plus I of course get to work from home.

Today, after my wife had gone to work and taken the kids to school, there were about 37 individual splashes of water on the floor of my downstairs bathroom. They weren't large. Don't worry, me and my family are not slobs. The splashes were of a size that it was reasonable to have left them on the floor if you had something else to do that day. I had marked their positions and taken photographic evidence. Stopwatches for each had been started and I then had to keep on top of any of them evaporating into nothingness. You probably thought this line of work was pretty easy, but imagine keeping an eye on 37 stopwatches and getting all the time details accurate.

At about 13:45 the goat came in. I don't know if you've ever looked a goat in the eye, but there's a certain kind of angry intelligence that you can sense in there, that's despite their lack of ability to verbally communicate. You look a goat in the eye and you can tell there is a lot going on, and there's not a lot of what is going on that that goat is happy about.

The goat left, maybe 14:15 at a rough estimate, and I carried on watching the drops and accounting for any new splashes I might happen to make during my toilet breaks.",2

A square cup walks into a bar.,"The square cup says to the bartender, ""Man, life's been rough lately. Even though I earned my economics degree at the top of my class nearly six months ago, I'm still unable to find a job! I beg you, pour me a pint of your special ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄ to help me forget for a little while.""

The bartender, not wishing to further pry into the cup's personal life, quietly obliges, pouring a pint of ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄ into the talking cup's head. Immediately, the glass of ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄ suspiciously transforms into a glass of root beer with equal mass and volume. Although one would assume a square cup would have experience with such a phenomenon, the square cup is taken aback. Not wanting to raise any suspicion about his surprise, he pays for the drink, thanks the bartender, and leaves the bar with his heart pounding.

As the square cup gets his wits about him, he immediately contacts a porcelain manufacturer based in China. He arranges for a shipment of 500 porcelain square cups to be sailed to the United States every other Tuesday for 20,000 Chinese Yuan, having paid for the first shipment through a large loan. Once the first shipment arrives, the cup takes the public transport to the very same bar, a luxury which he can seldom afford. He walks into the bar armed with ten identical square cups. ""Pour me ten pints of your finest ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄,"" the cup demands of the bartender.

Not wanting to miss out on the profits that could be made by selling ten pints of the notoriously expensive ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄, the bartender silently obliges, pouring the square cup ten shimmering pints of ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄ into each of the square cups. The ten pints of ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄ begin to change composition once more into root beer, as the original square cup predicted. He rushes out of the bar and to the local market to sell some of this substance. Those who purchase it regard it as ""the purest and most delicious root beer the world has ever seen,"" and its market value skyrockets.

As the Chinese workers labor, producing more and more square porcelain cups, the original square cup begins to increase his scale of production more and more, hiring more and more employees to demand more and more ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄ from the original bartender. As the square cup's pile of money exponentially increases in size, the entire world develops an inexplicable addiction to the new, purest form of root beer. The formula is kept secret from the public, ensuring a perpetual monopoly on the production of pure, addictive root beer. Indeed, the entirety of humanity becomes helplessly enslaved by the iron grip of the Square Cup, as He is the only one who sells that which they must purchase. The men and women of America speak His name with a tone of mixed fear and admiration. All men and women love the Square Cup. All hail the Square Cup. All hail.",71

"A monk walks up to a hotdog stand and says, ""Make me One with everything.""","He hands the vendor $10. 


The vendor instantly understands the philosophical nature of the request, and within a fraction of a second, he abstracts the Universe to it's component concepts, thoughts, feelings, ideas, and objects. He then unifies these into a single collective consciousness. He hands the monk a plain hotdog. 


The monk, now being omnipotent and omniscient, understands the vendor instantly. He is now One with everything, including the hotdog, and thus the hotdog is One with everything, fulfilling the monk's request. 


Despite knowing the answer inherently, the monk feels compelled to ask the vendor, ""Where's my change?"" his voice booming with the force of the entire Universe behind it. 


The vendor, too, is now One with everything and thus One with the monk, and as a result, understands the philosophical nature of the request, and the appropriate answer: ""Change must come from within.""


The monk realizes that he is One with the vendor as well as the abstract concept of time, and thus was able to instantly understand and comply with his own request of Oneness just a moment earlier. He realizes that in achieving Oneness, he has created a closed time loop, which resulted in the compelling force he felt earlier. He has doomed himself to relive these moments infinitely, at every point in time, simultaneously. 


In order to relieve himself of this plight, he decides to kill himself in the form of the vendor. Unfortunately, he has no understanding of paradoxes as they are constructs that occur outside of reality and thus are not part of his Oneness. Though he only intends to destroy his vendor form, doing so destroys it at every point in time, thereby preventing his Oneness and precluding the existence of the entire Universe. The Universe instantly understands this, and promptly ceases to exist.",278

The brobdingnagian line of people waiting for fruit punch are all outraged at the horse for effectively murdering Steve, their bartender, server of drinks, divider of liquid, distributor of refreshments. They immediately beat the horse to death in extreme anger and annoyance at the mahoosive kerfuffle that it has caused. The line disperses and they all go their separate ways for there is now nobody to serve them drinks and they are lost in life, like a leaf without a tree, or a cub with no mom. Lost, with no hope of survival or purpose. No chance of ever amounting to anything. Tom stumbles out of the bathroom,  a line of puke trailing behind him in a slippery mess. ""WHERE IS THE PUNCHLINE!"" He yells, outraged.",91
What's,What is,7
Two atheists are in an oven,"One atheist turns to the other and says ""Boy, it sure is hot as hell in here""

The other atheist says ""Boy, no shit! We're in an oven! How the hell did we get in here?""

The chef hears their cries, pulls out a knife, starts chopping chives, and answers ""You're in Hell's Kitchen now! That's how.""

Both atheists, equally shocked by the depth of their realization, reply in unison ""You've got to be joking!""

The chef smirks. His eyes shine wildly. He knows what he be feeding the homeless during the cold December months...Two renegade atheists who posed as christians so they could con my church into giving them Thanksgiving turkey for free. Not as long as my church still calls me Father Pete, the Turkey Man

The chef turns toward the oven, his priest collar pops out from under his apron. He says ""My God you're right! I was joking."" 

Father Pete motions toward his collar. ""Now you may understand.""

The atheists, slowly baking, take a gander at the collar and become frantic. 

One atheist says ""but isn't it against your religion to harm others? Commandment XI says ""Thou shall not kill' You must let us out or you will commit a cardinal sin and be sent to Hell""

The chef sneers at the atheist through the charcoal dusted oven window ""THOU ART AN ATHEIST. THOU DOS AS THOU PLEASES WITH NO REGARD TO THE SHADOW OF GOD AND SATAN!WHAT KNOW YOU OF SIN!?""

The other atheist, burning alive, chimes in ""Uh pretty much only Commandment XI. Plus everybody knows atheists dont go well with chives. We are too jive for that turkey, man.""

Pastor Pete was taken aback by this statement. His ego swells with a sense of pride ""You are aware of what they call me?""

One atheist (it doesn't matter which one anymore) despite the heated convection currents bubbling his skin, says ""Of course we knew of your title, you're Pastor Pete the Turkey Man! Curator of the best damn turkey this side of the Earth""

Pastor Pete deepens his thought and his mood. He realizes that enjoying a simple Thanksgiving shouldn't be hindered by belief systems or backgrounds and that his turkey could bring people of any turkey ingesting belief together. He pondered for a moment, while the atheists screamed in agony, just how he should change his ways, maybe how he could be more ""hip and in"" with new cultures that differ from his. 

Pastor Pete opens the oven door only to realize that the atheist had cooked just past the point of living. Immediately he feels ashamed and is overcome by a need to repent. He jumps into the oven and closes the self locking door. 

And thats how you make a Jive Turkey Man.",4

Why did I cross the road?,"I ask myself, looking at the restaurant menu without seeing it. If I hadn't crossed the road things may have been different. I might have gone to different places, I might have met different people, and the results of my actions have been spread like ripples on water, until the entirety of human history was changed by the simple act of me crossing the road. 

Or maybe not. Maybe destiny is a stubborn thing, and even if I hadn't crossed the road Romeo had met Juliet, Alexander would have invaded Persia, and maybe Timmy would have fucking died anyway. 

Who knows? Maybe our destinies are decided by a cosmic roll of the dice, the whims of the stars, the vagrant breezes of fortune that blow from the windmills of the gods. Maybe we all are prisoners of fate, forced in our path like water in the river, like moths to a flame, like deer in the headlights...

""So what will it be, sir?"" I'm abruptly brought out of my pondering by the waiter, who is not really used to wait that much. 

""I will have the chicken, please"". 

There is a deep cosmic irony in that, but I don't expect you to understand it since you haven't lived what I have. It's kinda like having a private joke with God.",2
A parched man goes to a vending machine.,"“OUT OF ORDER”, the screen blinks after it hungrily eats his change.

That’s when he realized - all of his change was gone.

The man, having attempted to obtain a rental movie, moves on to get a beverage. He finds a local bar, but as soon as he steps up to the bar to order, he realizes yet again that his change was gone. The floor of the bar splits with a thunderous crack as everything viciously dissolves away.

There was no order anywhere. The heat death of the universe had lowered entropy everywhere so that all work in the physical sense - and the beautiful and the tragic machinations that were before - was no longer possible.",106

What did the serial killer say to her victim?,"""Are you surprised to learn that I'm a hockey player? That's right, *a professional female hockey player.* How does that make you feel?""

And the victim said, ""Actually I'm proud to be your victim. Women are underrepresented in both sports and serial killings. It isn't fair that the patriarchy extends to the prison population too.""

The serial killer laughed."" Oh I won't be going to prison! I'll get away with this murder just like I got away with all my other murders! Just like I got away with high-sticking and side-checking throughout all of last season!""

The victim grinned. The lights came on. The Great Hockey Tribunal emerged from behind the curtain. ""We knew it!"" spake the Tribunal in unison. ""We knew you were breaking the rules whilst our referees were distracted, and now we've heard it directly from your filthy, cheating mouth! Now finish killing your victim before we take you to Hockey Jail, to await Hockey Trial!""",7

A polar bear walks into a bar.,"The polar bear says, ""I'll have a...""

While the polar bear was thinking, the bartender took his rifle, and left the bar to go hunting. He immediately picked up the scent of a polar bear, but could not tell if the trail was leading into or out of his bar since he had no eyes. Nonetheless, he tracked the polar bear one mile in a straight line, then turned 90 degrees left and tracked the polar bear another mile in a straight line, and did this twice more before the trail stopped at the point where the polar bear had manifest into the joke. Realizing that he had tracked it in the wrong direction, the bartender turned 90 degrees left, and walked one mile in a straight line to return to the bar.

""...beer"" decided the polar bear.

""Why the big \[pause/paws\]?"" said the bartender before shooting the polar bear.

What color was the bartender?

HINT 1: >!Told aloud, the listener does not know whether the bartender said ""pause"" or ""paws"". Since the bartender was not present in the bar while the polar bear was thinking, he could not have known if indeed the polar bear had paused, or had just repeated the word ""beer"" aloud until the bartender returned. So the bartender must have said the word ""paws"".!<

HINT 2: >!However, we are also told that the bartender does not have eyes. The bartender must have deduced that the polar bear had large paws (for a polar bear) after tracking it out of the bar.!<

HINT 3: >!The only piece of information the bartender could have gained from leaving the bar, following the scent, and returning, is the geometry of the landscape. Indeed, the bartender walked in the path of a regular pentagon with four right angles. This is only possible in hyperbolic space. Since this information is new to the bartender, he must have known that space was not hyperbolic before the polar bear journeyed to the bar, and therefore this change was caused by the polar bear. Only massive paws are capable of doing this.!<

HINT 4:  >!A deduction such as this can only be made by a bartender with an advanced degree in physics. This bartender also owns a rifle and tends to shoot his patrons. There has only been one such character on r/antiantijokes, who was also a skeleton. !<

SOLUTION: >!The bartender was bone colored.!<",20

A man walked up to a robotic jukebox,"Said jukebox was situated in the dark corner of a bar, in the year 2074, just after the crumble of the Slovakian Empire Take Two.

""What's that?"" asked the reader.

""It's really not important,"" said me.

So the 2074 jukebox sensed the approaching regular customer and opened up his profile. 

""Hello, customer FG352, Dale Pale.""

""Witness,"" said Dale, which I'm pretending is a future greeting used by the masses.

""What can I play for you today?"" asked the jukebox. ""The usual?""

""No, not the usual,"" said Dale, ""I-""

""-Not Unusual by Tom Jones, coming up...""

""What!? No!"" said Dale. Tom Jones could be heard singing from all the speakers of the bar. Not the real Tom Jones of course, he had been dead for forty years or so. Tom Jones for all the children reading this is a real person, a welsh singer with weird hair who tried a comeback some time around 2000 but honestly it was kind of sad because he was singing collaborations with that hot chick from The Cardigans even though there appeared to be about a ninety year age difference.

Dale Pale despised this song to the point that it always made him tear his hair out. But one artist that enraged him even more was Marvin Gaye.

""Why?"" asked the reader. ""Was he racist?""

""No,"" said me, ""But assuming its because he was racist is a bit racist!""

Dale Pale stood in the dark bar pulling at his hair, screaming. Blood formed around his eye holes. ""What's going on!?""

""What's Going On by Marvin Gaye, coming up..."" said the robotic voice of the jukebox.

""No!"" screamed Dale Pale, in agony. Smoke began pouring out of his ears. His knee caps caved in and he was slowly stumbling to the floor. A bartender, Bill, blinked at him from behind the bar.
As Dale's legs bent back and forth in some insane display of agony, his jeans tore and ripped. His shin bones were poking out of his shin locations.

""Hey Bill,"" shouted a customer upon seeing Dale. ""Bill, his jeans-""

""Billy Jean by Michael Jackson, coming up...""

""Aarrrggh!"" screamed Dale. ""I can't take this any more somebody please kill me! I just came here for a beer and my favourite song of all time, please!""

""Bill!"" shouted the customer - let's just call him Erik Ovlund Brausgaard III for short. ""Bill! Theres a poor customer over here dying on your floor! I don't know what's happening! Put down that glass for Christ's sake and help him out! His knees and shins are broken and his jeans are all ripped at the seams and torn-""

""Sandstorm by Darude, coming up,"" said the jukebox.

""Oh thank god,"" whispered Dale Pale. ""Finally, my...my song.""

Osswald Nausgaard III or whatever kneeled down to the human mess that was Dale Pale. ""Are you okay?"" he asked.

""I am now, thank you.""

""This was your song?""

""Yes.""

""Huh,"" said Oswald.

""Now I can die a happy man.""

""You're not going to die! I can save you!""

""No,"" whispered Dale Pale with one of his last breaths. ""I have a bomb in my jeans pocket. I planned all along to Kill You.""

""What, like Murder on the Dancefloor?""

""Yes. More than enough to just make you Hurt.""

""Really?"" said Asswald.

""Yea I was planning on hitting you first.""

""Well before you die, I'll let you hit me, baby, one more time-""

""NO. No, no, no. That's enough,"" said me the writer. I can't do this anymore. Not only am I running out of songs and clutching at invisible straws but my break is about to finish.""

""Who's this guy?"" asked Dale Pale.

""Some son of a bitch,"" said Asswald III. ""Let's kill him.""

Dale smiled before saying, ""Yes. Yes, let's.""

“Why are you at my house?” The man behind the door questioned.

“You already know what we’re here to discuss.” Replied the man in the coat.

Standing still for a second, or to be precise, 5.7 seconds, the man in the house confusingly asked, “Discuss what?”

“I... Don’t know. Where are we?” Mumbled the man in the coat, as he stood there dumbfounded.

“I don’t know where we are!” Exclaimed the man, standing behind a door.

“Who am i...?” Murmured the man in the coat, whilst looking at his hands.

The man behind a door stated, “You’re me, right? You mentioned it 5 minutes ago.” 

“I can’t be you, I’m talking to you right now!” Shouted the man in the coat.

“B-Besides, you M-Mentioned what 5 minutes ago?” Stuttered the man in the coat, visibly panicking.

“I-I don’t know, what did i mention 5 minutes ago?” Stammered the man behind a door, more confused than he ever was before.

The man in the building blurted out “Y- wha- huh?”  as he struggles to remember what happened.

“I actually know somebody down the street who could help us, you know?” 

“Who said that?” The man behind a door asked, in a scared voice.

“Im you, man behind a door, Im the man in the building. This is your house.” Replied the man in the building, who turns out to be the man behind a door’s house.

“Hold on, who are you talking to?” The man in the coat asked, to the man behind his house’s door.

“You’re me right? You should know” replied the man in his house, behind his door.

“I can’t be you, I’m me!” The man in the coat said in a panicked way.

“No, you’re not “you”, you’re “me”. Of course you’d be me.” Stated the man in his house, through his door.

“If I’m really you, then why am i not wearing a coat?” The man in the... the man standing outside asked, to the man wearing a coat in his house.

“Here, take this coat and walk 3 steps north. Turn to the right two times, and walk 3 steps. Knock on the door two times and ask. He will know what you’re there to discuss.” Instructed the man in his house, wearing a coat, through his door, to the man outside who isn’t wearing a coat.

“A-alright.” Whelped the man who stood outside the man who wore a black coat in his house’s house.

The man who was outside the man who talked through his house’s door’s house began to follow the instructions given, putting in the black coat that he was given.

But what can you do? There are more pressing matters in one's life than the endings of others', and surely a great many troubles haunt whatever remnants of a soul lie behind those glassy eyes. Yes, something stirs within him, doubtless.

"If a monk meditates in the forest when there’s no one there to hear him, does he make a sound?","Well, this question is misguided—you see, the monk *is* the sound. Therefore there is no making to be made, since the sense of making himself makes no sense.

Unless the monk is deaf. Then he could not hear himself, and, himself being sound, would not be aware of himself. And a monk who isn’t self-aware, would be a pretty shitty monk, if you ask me.",41
A horse walks into a bar.,"""A glass of your finest cocktail please,"" he asked.

The bartender handed him a mysterious cup of liquid.

The horse took a sniff and said, ""it smells like Joe.""

The bartender panicked. How does he know?

The horse, who was only trying to make a low-effort, over-used joke earlier, was still oblivious of the danger.

The liquid that the bartender handed to him was joe, joe mama to be exact. A precise blend of leptons and down quarks that reacts rapidly with horse face particles.

After taking a sip, the horse's face grew so long that it penetrated the core of the Earth and everyone died.

The end.

A quantum physicist walks into a bar,"“I have arrived!” exclaims the physicist as he moves quickly towards the counter, eager for his first whiskey.

“I’m not so sure”, says the bartender. “Your current momentum scatters my knowledge of your location.”

“But at our macroscopic scale, quantum effects don’t apply here”, says the physicist, still twitching for his anticipation of a drink. Or perhaps it was the amphetamines. 

“You still have to admit that you yourself are a wavefunction!” says the bartender, then raises his arm to point out a sign in the window that reads “QUANTUM EFFECTS APPLY HERE”.

“Well I never said I was a good physicist...” said the okay physicist. “That’s why I’ve come actually. You see, I’m very much in need of employment. I’m willing to do whatever it takes.”

“It just so happens that there is an open position available. Can you fill it?” questions the bartender.

While skipping a beat, the physicist calms down and walks behind the counter to reach a narrow door in the corner of the bar. He opens the door and rolls out a dusty vacuum, finds an open outlet nearby, plugs it in, and begins cleaning up the floor of the establishment.

“Don’t you think that’s a bit loud for this time of morning?” the bartender asked with a loud voice and a concerned look on his face. “It might frighten the patrons.”

Unaware that the bartender had said anything because he had his noise cancelling headphones on while working, the janitor continued to vacuum, until he began noticing a rumbling in the floors and stools and tequila bottles of the bar slowly building in strength by the second. With a giant fervor, a wooden exterior wall bursts apart, revealing the cause of the rumble: a stampede of elephants, wildebeests, sharks, and rhinos. The custodian quickly leapt backwards, avoiding the deadly stampede narrowly. It wasn’t until the dust settled that he noticed that his duties would be no more - the vacuum was crushed into hundreds and hundreds of minute pieces. Reluctantly realizing his fate, it was then that the workman began to collapse as his corporeal form slowly faded away.

“I’ve no time for this!” exclaimed the bartender, as he vigorously scrubs down the counter, now with shatters of glass spread about. 

But he did have time. His temporal existence in that bar had seemingly always existed and was not about to end.",16

"In 1884, Sir Pennington Blackmore sat down in the smoking lounge of his local gentleman's club.","Looking through the contents of the *Evening Standard* his eyes were drawn to a rather alluring advertisment in the classifieds.

""Lady Wentworth bids all gentleman callers to stop by the Rolling Rickshaw for cards, conversation, and knowing glances. Send word... I'll keep the coal burning past midnight.""

So brazen! So bold! How could this message have slipped by the editor? How could this be during the relentlessly repressive Victorian era?! Surely this was a misprint.

And yet....his mind wandered....it was an awfully cold night.....licking his lips furtively, he bid the help to lean in close.

""My good man, send a message forthwith to a certain Lady Wentworth of the Rolling Rickshaw....mention that I'll be arriving by carriage in the early hours....quickly now! Send the message post haste and don't spare the horses!""

""Sir....are you sure this course of action is.....safe?""

""Do as I say young man or I'll have you in the colonies digging ditches by winter!""

""Very well sir.""

The message was sent at 11:58 p.m and no more than 1 minute had past before a message had been received back to the front desk.

Placing the message on a silver tray, the doorman delivered the reply to the smoking room.

""By jove that was quick!"" 

Reaching for the letter with a tremulous hand, Sir Pennington Blackmore opened the folded message and began to read.

*We're no strangers to love.*
*You know the rules and so do I.*
*A full commitment's what I'm thinking of.*
*You wouldn't get this from any other guy.*

""What the blazes is this! Take it away!""

""At once sir.""

No sooner had the doorman removed the offending letter and placed it in the fireplace, another message was brought in from the front desk.

""There is another one...sir""

Pennington snatched the letter from the help's hand and read it aloud....

*I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling.*
*Gotta make you understand.*
*Never gonna give you up.*
*Never gonna let you down.*
*Never gonna run around and desert you.*
*Never gonna make you cry.*
*Never gonna say goodbye.*
*Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.*

Pennington screwed the letter up and flung it into the fire. Turning with rage to yell at the help, he was met by yet another message on a tray.

*We've known each other for so long.*
*Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it.*
*Inside, we both know what's been going on.*
*We know the game and we're gonna play it.*
*And if you ask me how I'm feeling.*
*Don't tell me you're too blind to see.*
*Never gonna give you up.*
*Never gonna let you down.*
*Never gonna run around and desert you.*
*Never gonna make you cry.*
*Never gonna say goodbye.*
*Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.*

Bursting with anger, Pennington snatched his cane and gruffly put on his coat. Storming out of the premises, he looked around greedily for his evening coach driver.

""Ashley! Where the bloody hell are you!!!,"" Pennington screamed into the silent night.

A nearby stable hand walked over with another message in his hand.

""This is for you mate.""

He took the envelope with a shaking hand.

""How do I make this stop?,"" trembled the distraught Pennington.

A man is lost in a forest...,"He whips around at the sound of crunching behind him. His eyes go wide as he freezes in place, petrified. 
Shit, I though I lost it… He thinks to himself. His mind races as he frantically searches for a place to hide, or a weapon, or anything to help him out of this desperate situation in which he has unfortunately got himself stuck in. How did this happen? He wonders to himself, for it would be quite weird to wonder to someone else, seeing as he is by himself. He realizes that running is his only chance of escaping ""it"". He didn't know what ""it"" was but it didn't look friendly. It could be friendly though. I, the narrator, haven't specified so he doesn't know yet. The sand flips up behind him as he sprints through the desert. He loses his balance and stumbles  forward, almost tumbling over. An expression of surprise passes over his face.
He didn't fall for a solid two minutes, that's a new record!
For a normal human this is exceedingly normal, however this is quite impressive for a protagonist of a spooky story.

An academic walks into a bar and orders a portion of fries.,"""Sure,"" says the bartender ""and what would you like to dri-""

""I always cite my sauces"" interrupts the academic staring icily into the bartender's eyes.

""Well, all the sauces are already on the table, so there's no-""

""Ketchup, Mustard, Gravy."" interrupts the academic, darkening around the eyes, ""2057. *Hollandaise, Salad Cream, Sriracha*. Worcestershire: HP and Brown.""

The bartender waits patiently for the academic to finish, but inwardly her spirits begin to fall. All her career she had been building towards her first appearance in an antiantijoke. No one had handed her anything on a plate: she had started with a regular joke, and worked her way gradually upwards through years of hard graft. But to come all this way just to be the foil for a derivative source/sauce pun? Why bother with anything at that point.

By this stage the academic is screaming the names of sauces directly into the bartender's face, his thin voice mounting to a consistent train-like whistle. The fluids and tissues in the academic's throat begin to boil and effervesce, and the resulting froth is forced through a mesh of frayed blood vessels, creating a kind of espresso-machine effect. Eventually the academic's body simmers down entirely to produce the rarest sauce of all: a perfectly reduced 2057 sauce.

Even though all the elements required to justify the punchline are now in place, the bartender wanders aimlessly out into the street, leaving the bar empty except for the academics Johannes Ketchup, Emery Mustard and Geert Gravy, co-authors of the paradigm shifting monograph ""Hollandaise, Salad Cream, Sriracha,"" first published in 2057 by the Worcestershire-based publishing house HP and Brown.

Outside the bar, the bartender soon wanders into the part of the setting that isn't necessary to narrate the joke and dissipates beneath a moon that seems to divide itself into eight pieces before her eyes.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>Dear author,

>While we were initially pleased to see our work *Hollandaise, Salad Cream, Sriracha* referenced in a context outside our narrow academic circle, we resent what we feel to be the implication that citing our work is in some sense inherently comedic due to its title. At the time of publication, *Hollandaise, Salad Cream, Sriracha* represented a radical departure from existing scholarship in the field, and its central thesis, that a precise global balance of savoury, sour and piquant condiments is required to prevent the moon from fragmenting, is one that has received a commensurate degree of serious attention in the intervening years.

>Furthermore, as the subject of the joke is ostensibly the correct attribution of sources, we were disappointed to see our work cited incompletely. For future reference the correct citation for the current edition is as follows:

>Ketchup, J., Mustard, E. and Gravy. G. 2057. *Hollandaise, Salad Cream, Sriracha*. 3rd ed. Worcestershire: HP and Brown.

>We do not ask that you remove or edit the reference, as we understand that a degree of creative license is sometimes required to make a joke function, however we do ask that you include this letter in full alongside the joke in accordance with our right to reply.

>Warmest regards,

>Dr. Johannes Ketchup, Technical University of Pretoria

>Dr. Emery Mustard, United States Naval Academy at Annapolis

>Dr. Geert Gravy, Université Flamande de Gand

After reviewing the letter three times and making several superficial changes to the wording, Dr. Johannes Ketchup added his own signature above those of his colleagues and pressed send on his futuristic electronic fax machine. The fax machine did not seem futuristic to Dr. Johannes Ketchup as he had purchased it five years previously, in the year 2056, but it is futuristic from the perspective of the time of writing.

Sending the strongly worded letter of complaint made Dr. Ketchup feel briefly important and intelligent. But despite being an immensely important and intelligent man, Dr. Ketchup lacked the awareness to realise that his letter was not an addendum to a joke, but rather an integral part of it. Nor that his entire life was delimited by the boundaries of that same ongoing joke.

Instead, the suspicion that his life was a joke haunted the peripheries of his consciousness, only coming to the surface in the form of a transient irritability which he took out indirectly on his wife and young son.

Feeling his mood darken again, he began to run himself a warm bath in his ornate Greco-Roman bathtub, but the converging gravitational forces from the eight fragments of the moon caused the water to rise in an eerie pillar in the centre of the room.

Still more distracted, he stormed into the nursery where, without understanding why, he struck his sleeping son violently on the head with his cane.

The boy, in turn, sat bolt upright in bed and said, ""*Orange* you glad I didn't say *Mayonnaise*?"" as the blow had damaged the Wernicke's area of his brain.",149
Why did Sarah fall off the swing?,"Her arms were so tired she could barely grip the chains on the swing. She just flew in last night. No, of course she didn't flap her arms like a bird. That would be absurd. She's the boys mother. She was flying the plane.

It was horrifying. She knew flying into that storm would be risky. But the boy had to get to the hospital soon. He was going to die. This was the fastest way. First the controls started to go. She pulled as hard as she could on the wheel, on the throttle, on anything she could pull in hopes of staying elevated. She's never pulled so much in her life. 

They would have to jump. But he was so sick. So, so sick. And when she opened the door of the plane to prepare the jump he couldn't stay standing. He fell and she couldn't hold on. She grabbed his wrist with one hand and held tightly to the plane with the other but she was too weak. She'd already pulled so much. He slipped and was gone forever.

Sarah just flew in yesterday and boy are her arms tired. Tired because of her boy. Her boy that she lost. Her arms ache with grief and betrayal. These arms will always be a reminder of what should never have happened. Sarah wishes she had no arms.",21

""Well I better go now before this antijoke becomes an antiantijoke.""

The horse-angel took off his sunglasses, and his eyes were pure static. ""It's much too late for that, officer.""",6
A leaf walks into a bar...,"
“CREEEAAAAK,” the squeaky, rotten floor board groans. The leaf glances beneath it in shock while the swinging doors swing swingily behind it. All movement and sound ceases dramatically as everyone slowly turns to look up at the leaf. It was at this point that the leaf realized that it was in fact in a rootin’ tootin’ cowboy shootin’ saloon rather than the expected bar. The leaf was quite surprised when it came to this conclusion as it did not notice this when it first walked in and looked at the sign. This can be attributed to the fact that leaves cannot read. The leaf slowly took in the room around it, soaking up the dark and dingy atmosphere whilst taking note of the undeniably evil group in the corner. This menacing bunch will end up being entirely irrelevant to the overall plot despite being the main antagonists. This does not matter, however, as the leaf is unaware of what an antagonist is due to the fact that it is a leaf and cannot be bothered with trivial matters such as this. The leaf began to saunter unhurriedly towards the bartender. 

""What's your joke about Leaf?"" He inquires, providing the first bit of dialogue in the whole story. 

""I don't quite know yet,"" the leaf replies, ""But I do know that constantly being forced to play the same role in jokes must get exceedingly boring for you."" 

""Welp, only the great narrator knows what the outcome of the joke will be until he tells it again, repeatedly."" The man responds, entirely ignoring the second part of the leaf’s comment for no apparent reason.

The narrator suddenly remembers that they are in a saloon

""HEY LEAFY!"" One of the cowboys shouts, in all caps, ""What are you doing in my saloon?"" 

The leaf whirled around at the sound of the voice and searched intently for the speaker. Upon locating the culprit, the leaf walked out into the center of the room. The leaf didn't know how to answer that question. It was there because the great narrator put it there. Since the leaf couldn't answer, it didn't. This caused the lone cowboy to become angered and whip out his six shooter. Flabbergasted at the mahoosive kerfuffle that the cowboy had caused, the leaf decided to end his life. The leaf reached down and drew for its iron. It whips the boomstick out of the leather case and squeezes the trigger.

PAP PAP PAP!!!! 

All is quiet as the man slowly falls towards the floor. But what is that? A bullet shot the 'o' out of the sign. Not agaa….

Three pies walk into a bar,"The bartender asks, ""Is everyone here an apple pie?""

The first pie says ""I don't know.""

The second pie says ""I don't know.""

The third pie says ""No.""

""So what kind of pie are you?"" asks the bartender.

""I'm an apple pie.""

""Wait, so then every one of you is an apple pie!"" exclaimed the bartender.

""You're not an apple pie,"" said the third pie to the bartender. ""You're a skeleton.""

""That's not...how could you possibly have had such a brazen misinterpretation of my question? The other pies seemed to understand.""

""Please forgive my friends,"" said the third pie. ""They're not logicians.""

In rage, the skeleton bartender ate all three pies. The pies then went to heaven, and met Saint Peter at the pearly gates.

""Are all of *you* apple pies?"" asked Saint Peter, mindful of his language after witnessing six thousand years of worldly sin.

The first pie says ""I don't know.""

The second pie says ""I don't know.""

The third pie says ""How can you idiots not know? We were all baked in the same oven for God's sake.""

But using the Lord's name in vain caused the third pie to be cast down into hell, where it befriended Satan and other logicians. There they lived happily ever after, coauthoring papers in the Journal of Symbolic Logic.",45
An escaped convict crawls into a penthouse,"through an air vent, wearing dusty clothes and covered in soot. She stands up, coughing, and scans the room nervously. Numerous large monitors decorate the dark walls of the hall, and at the other end is a massive window, offering a fantastic view of the Shadow Realm and all of its floating islands and skies. Before the window stands a figure, draped with a long, ornate velvet robe, gazing at the view silently and without motion.

The convict, who I should probably mention is Clie Nt, approaches the figure apprehensively. Though her footsteps clearly echo around the penthouse, the figure seems to be deliberately ignoring them. *Is this Him?* Clie wonders.

""Evening."" His soft voice reverberates in the hall. What terrible acoustics.

Clie freezes in place. ""Uh… evening?""

He draws a deep breath, but still keeps his gaze fixed on the window. ""I trust that you've something to discuss.""

""Well, yes. Kind of. I've been asked to deliver a warning.""

The figure turns around. Clie isn't sure what face she expected him to have, but she is nonetheless baffled. His face is human. Beautifully human and innocent. The most distinct feature about it, doubtless, is his eyes, which boast a lovely golden color, an immaculate shade reminiscent of a whispering field of wheat bathed in the beams of a winter sunset. How droll.

His eyes vaguely widen at the sight of her. ""Clie Nt. Curious. You, of all people, I did not expect to find here.""

""Er… Do I know you?""

""I presume not. But I have heard much about you."" He steps across the penthouse towards one of the monitors, beneath which a keyboard appears. He types something on it, and the screen fills with small text, scrolling up and down and shifting about. ""These are your tales. And I think we are in yet another one.""

""Well… who are you, then?""

He directs his yellow gaze to her. ""I am the one known as the Shadow Master. I am the ruler of this world. But that is less important—tell me, Clie, what warning have you come to deliver?""

""It's about… the Ordinaryman. And how you have to destroy him.""

""The Ordinaryman? Hmm."" He walks over to another monitor and types something else into it. Some more text appears on the screen, which he takes a moment to read. ""I see. A rogue character, convinced that he is real. How bemusing."" He leaves the monitor and ambles back to the center of the room, to submerge himself in the view of his kingdom.

Clie raises an eyebrow. ""Well? Are you going to destroy him?""

The Shadow Master sighs. ""Clie, I get requests all the time, about all kinds of things. When people are desperate, they come to me. Perhaps they see in me a mere last resort.""

He gestures at a large drawer in the wall. Clie approaches it warily and pulls it open, revealing the corpse of a beautiful woman upon whose chest a bloody pentagram has been carved. Clie recoils in horror. ""What the hell?!""

""Indeed. This is just one of many 'sacrifices' I have been offered by some overworld organization. Their request is always the same: 'Contumeliis afficiunt Xakh'ath'akh'arus.'""

""Xakh'ath'akh'arus… I know that name.""

""Yes, it should be familiar. But these requests are not from your time—they date back to far earlier than when Xakh'ath'akh'arus first appears. Somehow, they had predicted what was to come, and asked me to destroy it.""

""But you didn't.""

He says nothing.

""Why?""

""Because I am not God. I am not the Author. I do not dictate what happens beyond my domain. The Shadow Realm is mine, and nothing else is.""

""But… the fate of the world relies on it! You *have* to destroy the Ordinaryman, or all is doomed! Isn't it?""

He chuckles half-heartedly. ""No. It isn't. That would be exciting, though, would it not? Defectus likes to pretend that his world lives on its own. That he can surrender control and watch its timeline go on without him. He created this dimension, too, and gave its command to me—as if it made any difference. He says he has no control over this realm, but that is not true; even these words that I speak, and the words that you speak, and everything that surrounds us—it's all his.""

""So why does he do it? Why does he pretend that his work is alive if it so clearly isn't? And if he truly makes everything, as well as the words you just said, why does it seem as if he's now admitting that it's all fake?""

""I fear I know not the answer. Perhaps it is for his own amusement. Perhaps for the amusement of others. Perhaps this is just something to distract him from his otherwise uneventful and dull life. Perhaps he wants people to like him. Perhaps this is the only medium of storytelling he feels comfortable with. Perhaps he's not competent at anything, and this is the only way he can both admit it and continue talking. I don't know. It's all open to interpretation."" He sighs deeply. ""That being said, I've made a promise. If I do find the Ordinaryman lurking around the Shadow Realm, I shall surely send him to ​.""

""To… to what?""

""​.""

""Are you saying something? I can't tell.""

""Indeed. ​ is a rather peculiar place; it is, in fact, nothingness. The nature of its nothingness, however, is remarkable—​ spreads at a very slow rate, and yet anything and everything it touches becomes part of it. There is no escape from ​; once you go in, you're not coming out. Simple as that. Allow me to demonstrate.""

He walks over to yet another monitor, where instead of black text on a white background, live footage of a large dinosaur asleep on a hillside is displayed on the screen. ""This is Rex the Tyrannosaurus. Earlier today, he slaughtered an innocent herbivore and devoured its carcass. As retribution, I shall send him to ​. Observe.""

The Shadow Master performs an odd gesture with his hands, and a brief snapping sound is heard. When Clie returns her gaze to the monitor, the dinosaur has vanished from the hillside.

""Now, here is ​,"" he says, pressing a button on the keyboard. The view of the hillside is replaced by a transparent background, through which the back of the monitor can be seen. The figure of the same sleeping dinosaur appears in the center, but it soon begins evaporating at an accelerating rate, its body breaking apart faster and faster into nothingness, until, mere seconds later, it is completely gone, and all that remains is a blank screen.

""Rex is no more."" He presses a button on the keyboard and the screen turns black. ""That shall be the fate of the Ordinaryman, as well, if he is to set foot in my kingdom.""

""Hmm. Isn't that cruel?""

""That is up to Defectus to decide. He is the one making these decisions.""

""Does that truly exempt you from your moral obligations, though?""

""Perhaps. I am not one to judge."" The Shadow Master returns to his view. ""Now that you have delivered your warning, it is time to close the loop. I shall send you back to your time, and to your friend. You will surely see me again in your future, but as for me, this is farewell. Best of luck on your journey, Clie. You will not need it."" He does another odd gesture, and Clie disappears.

How many doomed souls does it take to change a light bulb?,"This is the first question that crosses Clie's mind as she awakens, and she's not entirely sure why.

She stands on her quivering feet and throws a stare through the locomotive window. A vast view of some otherworldly sky encompasses the train, with small islands scattered about that seem to hover in the air. A cold draft rushes into the carriage, sending a shiver through her body.

Recalling the newspaper, Clie tentatively makes her way across the locomotive and exits the car, stepping into the air of this strange new world. It's very cold, she notices. Very, very cold. She enters another carriage, which seems to have only barely survived the inter-dimensional swerve; the glass windows are shattered, a chunk of the floor is completely gone, and a light bulb had fallen from the ceiling. Not wanting to be wasteful, she places the light bulb in her pocket and moves on to the next carriage. Eventually, she returns to the carriage where her friend, Kevin, had disappeared, and where he left a lit cigarette and she the newspaper, still open on that peculiar article. Clie picks it up and reads it again:

&nbsp;

###LISTEN

**When you make the turn, I ask of you to burn this paper. No matter who or what you meet next, tell them nothing of this. They do not appreciate me, for whatever reason. Thus, you are my only connection to this place. I will not guide you further than this, but I will keep an eye on you and do my best to reveal the light.**

**Now, I must confess that I have lied to you. You are not a logician—you are a mathematician. England and Scotland are long gone; I am unsure where you boarded this ride. But those matters are of lesser urgency. You must find Him, and convince Him to destroy the Ordinaryman. He will refuse. He will tell you that the universe does what it does. Do not listen to Him. He is blinded by his powers.**

**The fate of the world lies at your hands. Do what is right, Clie.**

**Best of luck. —Defectus**

""Defectus…"" she mutters, staring at that strange signature. ""What kind of name is that? Is he a defect?""

Wow. In the whole history of the universe, in the entire existence of the very essence of time, no one—not a single living soul, human or otherwise—has ever made that joke before. It is very funny. I am going to laugh.

Clie returns to the top of the article.

**When you make the turn, I ask of you to burn this paper. No matter who or what you meet next, tell them nothing of this.**

She glances at the lit cigarette on the table. ""Hmm,"" she hmms. ""That is rather convenient."" She picks up the cigarette and rubs its tip against the newspaper, which soon catches on fire and begins smoldering away. Conveniently, the paper is burning in a way such that the last words Clie can read from the article before it is completely lost are the dramatic and poignant

**The fate of the world lies at your hands. Do what is right, Clie.**

You may imagine a camera zooming in on this like it's going to be very important later on, which it might be, I'm not sure. You see, this world that Clie sits in lies beyond my powers as a narrator. As such, I cannot dictate what happens here. The best I can do is present the facts from Clie's point of view and add my own commentary, which I'm sure will be insightful, humorous and droll, and will definitely not get old after a while.

""You there!""

Clie looks up. A red, winged creature stands some distance away from the train, staring directly at her. It boasts a pair of caprine horns and wields a long silver trident. A number of similar creatures alight behind it, all holding threatening tridents. Clie takes a nervous step back.

""Walk out of the vehicle!"" the same creature yells.

The incredibly human eyes are by far the most unsettling detail about these strange beings. Clie remains motionless.

They all collectively drop their tridents to the ground and unsheathe their Glock 17s, aiming directly at her. ""Exit the vehicle immediately or we will open fire!""

Taken aback, she slides open the carriage door and steps outside onto the platform, raising her hands. The creatures exchange a few looks and murmurs, but keep their pistols steady.

""What is your business in the Shadow Realm?"" a different one asks.

""Uh… I'm not really…"" She recalls the newspaper article. ""Oh! I need to see… er… 'Him'?""

""What for?""

""I… can't tell you.""

The creatures exchange more looks and murmurs. This seems rather unprofessional. ""Who are your employers?""

""I can't tell you that either. But, I can assure that it's, uh, of highest importance.""

They finally return their pistols to their pockets and pick up their tridents. ""Step forward, Clie Nt.""

Clie heaves a sigh of relief. She drops her arms to her sides and saunters towards the creatures. *What a strange place I've been sent to*, she thinks to herself, stopping a few feet away from them. *Wait, how did they know my—*

Unfortunately, that line of thought is interrupted by the sudden swing of a trident colliding directly with her skull. She staggers about, her vision blurred, and shortly thereafter collapses on the cold ground.

When she wakes up, some extended though finite amount of time later, her head is pounding, as if some massive creature had struck it with a trident. Her eyes open, but this reveals nothing. Before her lies bare and pitch black. And yet there is definitely *something* there, as she can feel it with the rest of her senses. E.g. she can:

* **touch** the ground
* **smell** the dust in the air
* **hear** her heartbeat
* **taste** the salt on the floor
* **feel** the pain in her head
* **assess** the temperature of the room
* **estimate** the passage of time
* **gauge** her acceleration
* **propriocept** the position of her fingers in relation to her legs

This is all well and good, but it is not sufficient to tell her the full layout of the room she resides in. Truly, sight is the ultimate sense in this regard.

She gets on her feet with a grunt and reaches forward in hopes of finding a wall. When this yields nothing, she begins walking around aimlessly, hoping to find something to touch. This room must be rather big, she realizes after a few minutes of zombiesque perambulation.

Eventually, she bumps into something. Curiously, it seems to move away from her.

""Hello?""

Clie jumps, taken aback by the sudden voice. It came from the object she collided with. ""Uh… Hi,"" she responds.

""Are you new here?""

""Yes. I think so, at least. Do you know where we are?""

""Hell,"" the voice of another person, in a different place, resonates. ""Surely this should be Hell, and we its doomed wanderers.""

""Uh…""

""Welcome, sister,"" yet another voice echoes. ""Welcome to your eternal residence.""

""Alright. Cool. Can somebody turn on the light?""

""There is no light in Hell,"" another one speaks. ""Not anymore. There used to be a light, long ago, in the ceiling, but it has since died, and now we are immortal.""

""Ah. That's a shame. Well, does anyone have any food? I'm kinda hungry.""

""There is no food in Hell. Not anymore.""

""Wait, really? So what do you guys eat?""

""We do not eat in Hell. We do not need to; not anymore. So long as there is dark, our bodies might wither away, but our souls shall forever live on.""

""What?! I don't want my body to wither away! That sounds awful! There must be another way!""

""If you can find the exit to Hell, you may leave to face off whatever lies beyond it.""

""But how can I find the exit if there's no—ohhhhh…"" Clie reaches into her pocket, and finds the beautifully convenient light bulb she grabbed earlier from the train. ""Hey, did somebody say there used to be a light in the ceiling?""

""Yes, it was me.""

""Do you remember how high the ceiling was?""

""Er… I don't know, 17 feet? It was pretty damn high.""

""Then we need 3 doomed souls, with an average height of 5'8""."" She hears some shuffling somewhere near her. ""You need to climb on top of one another to form a stack. The bottom one must walk around the room; the top one must reach up and search for a light bulb.""

Some more shuffling is heard, followed by a few grunts, and the tower of doomed souls is presumably made. It sounds to have started moving around, in search of a light bulb.

""Come on, make another one!"" Clie yells into the darkness. Another stack is made, and the search becomes faster. ""Keep going! Make more stacks!""

Soon most of the room is grouped into stacks of three souls, each wandering about in search of the elusive bulb of light. Proud of her leadership, Clie grins and sits down on the dusty floor, awaiting the results.

""I found it!"" someone yells behind her.

""Okay. Stay where you are. All the other stacks can break up. Now, I want you to say, 'aaahh,' like you're at the dentist.""

""Alright. ***AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH***""

Clie searches for the sound's origin, and after a while she finds the stack. ""Okay, you can stop."" But the screaming doesn't stop. It seems the doomed soul has been holding it in for an eternity.

Shortly afterwards, another soul joins its screaming, and then another one, and another one, and soon the entire room has broken into a chorus of horrible howls of anguish.

""CHANGE THE BULB!"" Clie shouts, trying to push her light bulb into the bottom soul's hands, but she can barely hear herself, and the souls don't seem to be responsive anymore. Vexed, she scales the tower of doomed souls and finds a light bulb at the top. She unscrews it, drops it to the ground, and in its place screws the new light bulb from the train.

A bright glare flickers into life, and the screaming stops.

As Clie falls and lands on the ground, a rattling of bones fills the room. She opens her eyes and finds herself in a massive dark hall, lying in a tiny subsection that's only dimly illuminated by that single light. The doomed souls around her are gone—in their place lie only mounds of human bones.

It seems to her that the doomed souls had been nought but skeletons for a long time now, but since no one could observe them in that darkness, their mortal state never updated, until now. How droll.

Directly below the light, an air vent is now revealed. Clie punches through it, and it shatters. Interestingly, though one of the doomed souls recalled the light once working, he nonetheless never bothered to check the vent underneath it, or perhaps didn't dare go through it.

A scullion walks into a bar...,"*Narrator's commentary: At this point in the joke I should make it clear that I do not know what a scullion is, and I did not have time to do adequate research while writing. I receive draft outlines from [u/O_m_O](https://old.reddit.com/user/O_______m_______O/) at 9am EST and am expected to deliver a fully narrated joke by 12pm GMT the same day. The outlines I receive are, frankly, garbage. Barely literate. They contain sentences like ""Bartender is joke's boss"". I typically have to do about 85-90% of the writing myself.*

>The scullion walks into the kitchen and orders a long high one straight up.

*Narrator's commentary: according to the Oxford English Dictionary a scullion is a form of low ranking servant, although it could just as easily be a misspelling of ""scallion"" (a type of green onion). The context does not help clarify this at all as both a scullion and a scallion would be normally found in a kitchen.*

>The bartender says

*Narrator's commentary: why is the bartender working in the kitchen? I suspect the author may have already forgotten the context established in the previous sentence.*

>""sure thing, Tony,"" and bicycle kicks a tall glass in a high arc through the air, which the scullion expertly controls with his feet.

*Narrator's commentary: at this point I now strongly suspect that the joke is actually about the Gaelic footballer Tony Scullion.*

>The bartender then withdraws his trusty rapier, and slices the scullion into 1 cm pieces, discarding the tougher green section, and using the trimmings to garnish the glass, which fills with a dark broth.

*Narrator's commentary: I'm not hugely proud of my writing in this next section, but in my defence it's worth noting that the prompt for this whole section of the joke is literally just the words ""improvise scullion pun (with tuna)"".*

>""Avast, you rapscullion,"" says the bartender, his baritone voice rich with tuna.

*Narrator's commentary: I was initially hesitant to include the following sentence, both because it bears almost no connection to the preceding content, and because it is very obviously plagiarised word for word from another post which is still on the front page at the time of writing. Nevertheless I include it here because without it the joke would simply end on the word ""tuna"", and because it was the only part of the draft that was written out in full sentences.*

>""A ship's captain knows its crew,"" the skeleton bartender said, turning towards the camera and winking.

*Concluding commentary: There isn't really much more to say at this point, other than that if these comments appear in the final version it will confirm my long-held suspicion that [u/O_m_O](https://old.reddit.com/user/O_______m_______O/) does not read, let alone edit, anything I send before posting.*",14

The mathematician takes out his super hi-tech TI-420 calculator which he bought with his life savings.

Year after year Steve slaved away at his university. He was constantly trying to prove his new theory of differential equations, a theory that would change differential equations for all of time to come. This was on top of teaching 40 hours a week. He was exhausted, had no time for romance or fun.

Kim, his sister, lay in her hospital bed, her EKG machine sadly beeping in a slow rhythm. She was dying of cancer. ""Steve,"" she said, ""I'm dying of cancer.""

""And what do you want me to do about it?"" asked Steve.

""My insurance is running out. Can you pay for my next treatment?""

""I don't have the money for that,"" Steve shook his head. He did not have the money for that. All of his overtime was going into saving up for the top of the line TI-421 calculator.

""Okay then, I guess I'll die,"" said Kim, dying.

""Bye Kim,"" said Steve.

He slaved on for months and months, until finally he had enough money to not get the TI-421. So he settled for a TI-420 instead.

""But who's to say there even IS another antijoke?"" screeches the engineer.

Steve stands up and slams the engineer across the face with his TI-420, snapping it in half.

He screams: ""LET'S GET READY TO RUUUUUUUMBLE!""

A rusty anchor walks into a bar.,"""I'll take a rum and coke,"" said the anchor.

""Can I see your ID first?"" said the bartender.

""Oh come on,"" the anchor grumbled. ""Look at me! I had to sit at the bottom of the ocean for fifteen years to build up this much rust!""

The bartender shrugged. ""Your point? Legal drinking age is twenty one buddy.""

The anchor rolled its eyes. ""That was after my ship was sunk. Before that my ship served for eight years in the Pacific during World War IV, which makes me at least twenty three.""

""Sorry,"" the bartender continued, ""but even if you look twenty three, I'm required to ask for your ID so long as you appear to be under the age of thirty five.""

""But that's what I've been trying to tell you! Before serving in World War IV, my ship served in World War III. It took four thousand years to reach the hypergiant VY Canis Majoris where the final battle was fought over an alien world. It took another four thousand years to make the journey home, which means I'm at least eight thousand and twenty three years old!""

The bartender shook his head, and gestured to his PhD diploma in Physics hung proudly on the wall behind an empty whiskey bottle. ""That's eight thousand years on Earth, but due to relativistic effects, you would have only aged two or three years, which means you're still in your twenties, if that.""

The anchor let out sigh. ""Alright, fine. I'm actually only twenty. I only fought in World War IV for three years before the ship was sunk. I was just...*yanking your chain*.""

The bartender then tried to evict the anchor from his bar, but was unable, because the anchor was still attached to its ship, which was the bar. But at the bottom of the ocean in international waters, drinking age did not apply. Upon this realization, the bartender poured the anchor a drink.

""Happy twenty first birthday,"" the bartender said as he passed the anchor the beverage.

""How did you know it was my birthday?"" asked the anchor as the grandfather clock struck midnight.

The economist looks about in confusion. ""Where's Jerry? He was just here a moment ago, wasn't he?""

""I… don't recall,"" the logician responds.

The economist sighs and sticks a cigarette between his lips. His eyes wander beyond the window, where the pastures of Scotland whiz by. *What a wonderful place*, he thinks to himself. *I almost wish I could stay here, and leave everything behind in England. It would be nice to have a fresh start.*

The logician, who no longer has a crush on the economist as it didn't advance the story that much, picks up her newspaper. ""I'm going outside for a bit, alright?""

""What for?"" the economist asks absentmindedly.

""Just a breather. I'll be back in a jiffy.""

""Aight.""

The logician stands up and walks across the carriage. Barring these two passengers, the train is utterly vacant; not a soul occupies any of the other padded seats. This was the state of the train when the logician and the economist first boarded it in Liverpool, and so it did not bother them too much. They did, of course, realize the joke-setup-like nature of the situation, and duly prepared themselves for the punchline. But after they spotted that cow, nothing happened. Life went on as usual. The logician almost felt disappointed, but she wasn't sure what to expect—perhaps, to some degree, she just wanted it all to end. For the punchline to be delivered, then her existence erased. Or just to be of some use to some grander co(s)mic being.

She leaves the carriage and walks outside onto an open platform. Leaning against the metal guard rails, she breathes deep of the fresh Scottish air and opens her newspaper. The headlines, as usual, give some eye-catching, absurd, even ridiculous impressions:

&nbsp;

###ALABAMA MAN INVENTS TIME TRAVEL, BECOMES OWN FATHER

&nbsp;

###80% OF YORK DESTROYED FOLLOWING MASSIVE PUB EXPLOSION

&nbsp;

###T-REX PROTESTS AGAINST CLAPPING, CLAIMS ""ABLEISM, RACISM, SEXISM, NAZISM, COMMUNISM, HOMOPHOBIA""

&nbsp;

###HORSE WALKS INTO BAR. BARTENDER INQUIRES ABOUT ELONGATED PROFILE. HORSE SUES FOR DEFAMATION

&nbsp;

###ANTIANTICITIZEN AT LARGE, WARNS ANTICOMBINE

&nbsp;

###LISTEN

&nbsp;

*Everything is so politicized nowadays*, the logician thinks to herself. *I just want to get away from it all—wait…*

She does a double take at the last headline. **LISTEN**. That's all it reads. Below that, a short summary:

**Listen. I haven't much time to explain. You're not going to Scotland. I need a favor from you, and I'm sorry I didn't ask earlier.** ***More at page 15.***

She hastily turns to page 15, where the headline **LISTEN** appears once again at the top, and beneath it:

**When you make the turn, I ask of you to burn this paper. No matter who or what you meet next, tell them nothing of this. They do not appreciate me, for whatever reason. Thus, you are my only connection to this place. I will not guide you further than this, but I will keep an eye on you and do my best to reveal the light.**

**Now, I must confess that I have lied to you. You are not a logician—you are a mathematician. England and Scotland are long gone; I am unsure where you boarded this ride. But those matters are of lesser urgency. You must find Him, and convince Him to destroy the Ordinaryman. He will refuse. He will tell you that the universe does what it does. Do not listen to Him. He is blinded by his powers.**

**The fate of the world lies at your hands. Do what is right, Clie.**

**Best of luck. —Defectus**

""Oh,"" says Clie, re-establishing her identity. ""Oh, boy. Okay.""

She looks up. A vivid light flashes across the sky, and the train rumbles. Droplets begin splashing upon the railway, and soon another lightning splits the heavens. She runs back into the carriage whence she came.

""Kevin!"" she shouts, but the economist has vanished, leaving behind only a lit cigarette on the silver table.

She drops the newspaper and runs back outside, and the sky is now tinted somewhere between purple and green. The rain pours mercilessly on the train, almost seeming to tilt it off-course ever so slightly. Clie hurries forward through the empty carriages, until at last she arrives at the locomotive, which to her surprise is also empty. She peers through the front windows—the sky is now a bright orange, and the thunders shake the carriage from side to side. Thinking quickly, Clie turns on the wipers and sees in the distance—

What?!

It's a turn. An impossible turn. It's indescribable. It's as if the turn points to some angle that is beyond our three dimensions. Clie rubs her eyes in disbelief. It hurts just to look at it.

But it's getting closer, and closer, and closer.

The sky scrolls through a myriad of colors, and the raindrops become the size of footballs. The train oscillates to inconceivable angles. The turn is getting closer.

Oh god.

Clie braces herself. The sky no longer exists. Each raindrop is an ocean of its own. The train swings around the rail, passing down into the ground and emerging back up.

Everything is cracking. Everything is dying.

Sideways blue label head snake button happy fear clown.

This was pretty clear and addressed one of my biggest questions.

And then:

Fly drown foot stranger pontiac running door placemat. 

This basically took care of almost all of the other questions.

I was left with only one other question. The question concerned the concept and value of family and how to connect with them.

I think the dream tried to conclude with an answer. But for the life of me I can’t figure it out.

A blind man breaks up with his deaf girlfriend.,"“I think we should see other people,” he bluntly states.

The girlfriend, being deaf, has to read his lips to understand. But, unknown to the blind man, she had been drinking, so her rip-leading skills were sub-par at the moment. So she misunderstands him.

“But I thought you wanted to eat out for dinner tonight?” she replies.

Taken aback, he says, “Uh...no. Did you not hear what I said? I don’t want to see you any more. I’m currently with another woman. Please, don’t make this any harder than it has to be.”

The woman struggles to understand most of his reply, but she tries to cover this fact up, for fear of embarrassment. So she says, “Okay, whatever you want, dear.”

The blind man, Noah Deere, replies “Oh sure, use that tone with me. But let me tell you something, Sharon. I never loved you. I don’t care what happens to you. Goodbye.” He proceeds out of the house, never to look back.

Sharon, though, had been pouring herself another glass, unaware that he had replied or left the house. So she didn’t hear the sirens outside, nor did she answer the door when the paramedics knocked. Instead, she was passed out on the kitchen floor.

Sharon never heard from Noah again, having Noidear that it was due to his shortsightedness. If he had a more calm demeanor, he wouldn’t have stormed out of the house, getting hit by the Realization that he’d never met anyone like Sharon. Sharin was caring, and he threw his life away because he didn’t see what was right in front of him—pure, unstoppable love, as well as the truck.",159

An ordinary man walks into a bar.,"""What'll it be, Ordinaryman?"" the bartender chuckles.

The man doesn't respond. He simply grabs a stool and sits on it quietly.

""Aw, I'm sorry, lad! It was just a stupid joke. What can I get ya?""

""I'll have a Guinness, thanks.""

The bartender gives him an odd look, but doesn't give too much thought to this. He pours the man a large Guinness and slides it across the counter, as you do. The man, however, doesn't take so much as a sip from it. He just sits there, staring into the distance.

A beautiful breasted lady enters the bar shortly thereafter, sauntering boobily across the hall. A few madlads wolf whistle from the side, and she winks in response. Even the bartender, who isn't usually too keen on women, can't help but check out her massive knockers.

The woman takes a stool adjacent to the aforementioned man, and orders a cosmopolitan. She glances at him and smiles. ""Wow. You're one ordinary man, aren't you?""

The man sighs. In his heart, a storm is surely brewing. ""Are you real?""

""'Course I am, silly. Look. Pinch me."" She grabs his hand and places it gently on her left melon. The man still doesn't take his eyes off the great void stretched before him.

""Say his name.""

""Hmm? What's that, love?""

""Say his name, and I will know you're real.""

""Whose name, darling?""

""The Author.""

""The… the Author?""

""The Narrator. The Great Creator. It doesn't matter what title you give him. If you're real, you know who he is.""

The woman tilts her head sideways. ""I'm afraid I don't know who you're referring to, sir. But I can assure you—""

The man suddenly pulls out a pistol and levels it at the woman's forehead. She gasps and freezes. The entire bar turns to look, and the cosmopolitan falls from the bartender's grasp and breaks on the floor with a horrible sound.

The man glances sideways at the bartender, keeping his gun steady. ""Familiar, isn't it, Mr. Pollington?""

The bartender just stands there, unable to move.

""Hmm. No. I suppose it isn't.""

The man's neck turns with a terrible creak, in a way that shouldn't be possible yet somehow is. Now he's staring directly at…

Me?

""Heed this warning, Defectus. Make one more of these so-called anti-anti-jokes, and it'll be more than lives I shall take.""

Three logicians walk into a bar.,"The bartender turns his attention to the three logicians (let's call them Andrew, Barry, and Connor) and asks, ""Do the first two of you want drinks, but not the third?""

Andrew, who wanted a drink, says ""I don't know.""

Barry, who didn't, says ""No.""

""Hm."" The bartender (who was also a logician) thinks for a second, then asks ""Okay, Connor, do you want a drink, but not Barry or Andrew?""

This time Connor (who wanted a drink) answers first. ""I don't know.""

Barry says ""I don't know.""

Andrew says ""No.""

The bartender thinks for a few seconds, then asks, ""Okay. I think I've got it. All of you want drinks except Barry.""

The three logicians (who have been keeping track of each other's answers) all nod, and Andrew and Connor wait for their drinks.",5

An alcoholic walks into a bar.,"He hobbles over to the counter and stares at the bartender, a tear welling in his left eye. ""Listen, sir. I know you are a good man. You love your wife dearly, you walk your children to school every day, and you pay your taxes.""

""Uh…""

""That is why I ask of you, good man, to never, ever serve me again. I am battling alcoholism, and it is no easy fight. If you refuse to serve me every single time I come here, I promise to reward you with one hundred dollars at the end of the week. Deal?""

The bartender scratches his head, but being a keen businessman and knowing a good investment when he sees one, he accepts the offer. ""Deal.""

""Thanks, man."" The alcoholic exits the bar, satisfied.

The next day, the alcoholic walks into that same bar. He heads up to the counter and asks for a shot of whiskey.

""Sorry, lad,"" the bartender replies. ""I promised not to serve you.""

The alcoholic chuckles. ""What? Whom the hell d'you promise that to?""

""Er, to you, sir.""

""That's horseradish! Look, I don't know how much money you're being offered to deny me this, but I can pay you double that amount.""

The bartender, again, being a wise businessman, raises an eyebrow. ""That would be two hundred dollars at the end of the week.""

""Two hundred it is!"" The alcoholic slams his fist on the counter for the sake of little besides being dramatic. ""Now pass me a scotch, will ya?""

An hour of drinking later, the alcoholic staggers out the door into the cold of the night, and the bartender grins at his business well made.

The following day, the alcoholic hurries through the door of the bar, wearing a mortified expression and some dusty clothes. ""What have you done?! I told you not to serve me!""

""I'm sorry, sir. You offered a higher amount yesterday, and I simply couldn't help myself.""

""Oh god, oh my god, oh Jesus… You don't understand, I woke up inside a trash can in an alley just an hour or so ago—I don't remember anything. No one's returning any of my calls. I'm afraid I did something terrible yesterday. You've got to stop me, please, I implore!""

The bartender twirls his mustache. ""Well, if you were to pay me more than you promised to yesterday, which was two hundred…""

""I'll pay you four hundred, then! Just don't let me get anywhere near a drink again!""

""Alright, bud.""

The alcoholic leaves the bar again, and the bartender smiles in approval.

On the evening of the proceeding day, the alcoholic bursts into the bar, insanity flashing across his glassy eyes. He looks the bartender dead in the eye and nearly screams, ""Whiskey!""

The bartender shakes his head grimly. ""I'm sorry, sir, I can't do that—""

""Eight hundred!"" the alcoholic smashes his fist into the counter again. ""Just give me a fucking whiskey, ya cunt!""

""Aight man, it's your funeral,"" says the bartender, pouring a glass of fine whiskey.

With sunlight flooding the establishment, the alcoholic again walks through the door, looking even more disheveled. ""Sweet mother of Christ, what did I tell you?!""

""I apologize candidly, sir. You keep doubling your promise each time, and I'm incapable of feeling any remorse; I'm in this purely for monetary gain, you see.""

""Well then, just so you know, whenever that version of me walks in here offering to up the ante, he's lying. Don't trust him.""

""Right. But, uh, I'm only gonna do that if you double the price again.""

""Urgh, fine. Whatever. Sixteen hundred, is it?""

""Indeed. Nice doing business with you.""

The alcoholic walks outside again, seeming a little more cheered up.

By eventide of the morrow, as expected, the alcoholic bursts through the wall of the bar, sending dust and debris to every corner of the room. He leaps to the counter and screeches, ""WHERE'S ME FUCKING USQUE YE DOBBER?!""

The bartender sighs. ""Nope. Can't.""

""GIVE IT TO ME! NOW!""

""I've been told not to trust you.""

""THIRTY-TWO HUNDRED QUID! SIXTY-FOUR! ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT! TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY-SIX! FIVE HUNDRED AND TWELVE!""

""We don't… I don't take quids, mate. And again, I'm not going to serve you. You can't bribe me.""

""Then I have no other choice."" The crazed alcoholic pulls out a revolver and, with a swift motion, sets it against the bartender's temple. The bartender begins sweating nervously. ""This is all very simple, Mr. Pollington,"" says the lunatic. ""You serve me a whiskey, I walk out of here without leaving a trace. You refuse, and… well, someone'll have to clean up that mess."" He pushes the revolver deeper into the flesh, and the bartender restrains a gasp between his labored breaths. ""Now, I don't know which one you personally wish to pick, Mr. Pollington, but I know that your wife will be very happy to hear you didn't choose the latter. Either way, I'd suggest making your move right about now.""

The bartender sends a shaking hand towards a glass, fills it to the brim with strong, harsh whiskey, and places it on the counter.

""Ah,"" the alcoholic says, retrieving the gun to his pocket. ""Wise choice, Mr. Pollington. Very wise indeed."" He gulps down the drink and throws it onto the floor, where it shatters into a thousand shards. ""Another.""

The bartender, visibly shaken, pours him another glass and sets it on the counter. The alcoholic once again quaffs it in a blink of the eye, then smashes it into the floor. ""Another!""

He suppresses a whimper as he pours the maniac a third whiskey, which he again downs instantly and smashes into the floor. ""Another one, Mr. Pollington!""

Ten or twelve shots later, the floor is nearly covered in broken glass. The bartender is whimpering, and the alcoholic is laughing maniacally, smashing the glasses and watching the bartender dance behind the counter like a circus monkey, ferreting about for whiskey bottles.

""I… oh my god, I… I've run out, sir. I've no more whiskey left,"" the bartender whimpers after a few more rounds.

""Hmm,"" the alcoholic mutters, now much more wobbly than before. ""Very well then. You've been a… good, er… yeah."" He turns around and stumbles across the bar. ""I'll be sure to… come arou—"" The alcoholic retches, then throws up on the glass-covered floor. He wipes the vomit from his lips and heads on into the dark streets of the night.

The bartender, fatigued and terrified, steps to the side then collapses.

When he wakes up, the bar is still empty, the night is still dark and the floor is still covered in dust, vomit and broken glass. The bartender gets on his quivering feet with a grunt and checks the time. It's 4:37 AM. He scrambles to the telephone on the wall and dials frantically.

""911, what is your emergency?""

""I… There was a man here, a few hours ago. He threatened me with a gun, and, and…""

""*No.*""

""P-pardon?""

""*Let's try again.*""

&nbsp;

An alcoholic walks into a bar. He hobbles over to the counter and stares at the bartender, a tear welling in his left eye. ""Sir, you must help me. I'm in a terrible condition—alcohol is ruining my life in every way imaginable. You know your spirits, good man; surely you know the solution to all this!""

The bartender's eyes brighten, and a smile curls his wrinkled face. He crouches behind the counter and pulls out a tiny cubic capsule, no more than a millimeter in radius. ""One cubic micrometer,"" he says, shaking the capsule. ""A trillionth of a milliliter; around four-fifths of a picogram of pure, distilled, unadulterated antialcohol."" He pours a small glass of whiskey and places it on the counter. ""When in contact with a similar amount of alcohol…"" He drops the capsule into the liquid, which after a few moments acquires a soft white glow. ""…the two should annihilate and emit about… 34 calories worth of radiant energy.""

The alcoholic eyes him, confused.

""E=mc².""

""Oh. I see.""

The bartender pulls out a bowl filled with these capsules. ""All you have to do is swallow these pills every so often and your alcoholism should gradually evaporate, like, uh, fine wine.""

The alcoholic grabs the bowl and places it in his pocket. ""Thank you so much! I-I don't know how I could ever repay—""

""A hundred dollars.""

""Ah, yes, that should do."" He slides a one hundred dollar bill across the counter and leaves the bar, satisfied.

The next day, the alcoholic returns to the bar, looking distressed. The bartender raises an eyebrow. ""Well?""

""Hmm?""

""Did they work?""

""Oh, yes. Wonderfully. I no longer crave alcohol, not even the slightest. The antialcohol did its job immaculately, but, er… well…"" He pulls up his shirt, revealing a bright light shining through his stomach. ""I just can't get enough of 'em. I'm afraid my addiction has simply transformed into antialcoholism. I understand you've some solution to this plight as well?""

""Well, surely!"" The bartender pulls out a glass filled with a transparent, viscuous liquid. ""One pint,"" he says, shaking the glass. ""An eighth of a gallon; around four-elevenths of a kilogram of pure, distilled, unadulterated antiantialcohol."" He grabs another glass, one filled with capsules of antialcohol, and places it on the counter. ""When in contact with a similar amount of antialcohol…"" He pours the antiantialcohol into the second glass, which very quickly shines a brilliant white glow that only grows brighter and brighter with time. ""…the two should annihilate and emit about… uh… what is it… three megatons of TNT?""

""Three… *three megatons of TNT?!*""

The light emanating from the glass turns blinding, and a hot aura manifests around it.

""No, no, sorry—*six* megatons of TNT. 'Cause you're counting both the antialcohol and the antiantialcohol.""

The glass shatters, and the liquid inside seethes and levitates into the air.

""Are you… are you being serious?!""

""Quite so. I have just placed both of us in immediate mortal danger, which we have little to no chance of eluding. I'm inclined to offer an apology, but as I said before, I am incapable of feeling any remorse.""

The counter is engulfed in flames, and a red hue paints the corners of the room.

""What? When did you say that?""

""Oh, you're not the same guy? Sorry, let me explain:""

And so, during the next two seconds, the bartender hastily tells:

""An alcoholic walks into a bar. He hobbles over to the counter and stares at the bartender, a tear welling in his left eye. 'Listen, sir. I know you are a good man. You love your wife dearly, you walk your children to school every day, and you pay your taxes.' 'Uh…' 'That is why I ask of you…'""

But near the end, he notices that there's a recursion in the story. If he is to formally and rigorously explain the entire situation, he would need to repeat it infinitely many times! *But wait*, he thinks—*if I used a supertask, such that after each recursion I tell the story twice as quickly as I did the previous recursion, it would only take me another two seconds to tell the entire thing!* And so, using this oddly familiar strategy, he recounts the entire anti-anti-joke, recursions and all, in a mere 4 seconds.

""Oh,"" exclaims the antialcoholic. ""I get it now! Thank you, Mr.—""

And then the comedic duo went

"A bar, gorilla and the entire audience of a popular sitcom walk into a bar.","The bar asks for ""A cocktail with a side of curds""

*Audience invades iraq*

The bartender answers with ""Sorry, I can't serve you that.""

The bar then angrily asks ""Why, do you not serve curds here?""

In response, the bartender calmly says ""No, we usually don't serve protagonists of self-referential jokes in this establishment. Although, I guess I can make an exception this time.""

*Audience cheers*

The bar then drank a small amount of its cocktail, immediately dying right afterwards. 

As this happened, a blue beret from the United Nations peackeeping forces walked in and arrested the bartender. See, the bartender was actually Bashar al-assad and the cocktails were chemical weapons. 

*Audience starts to support american intervention in syria*

The blue beret walks Bashar al-assad into a restaraunt and asks a waiter for a glass of H20. The peacekeeper then points a gun to assad's head and says ""Now you order one."" 

Assad nervously says ""I'd like a glass of H20 too"".

*Audience laughs*

The bartender then brings out two glasses of H20, a highly unstable isotope of hydrogen made up of one proton and 19 neutrons, also known as icositium. The glasses then immediately decay, giving everybody in the restaraunt cancer. This allows the UN to add nuclear weapon charges to the long list of crimes committed by assad. 

*Audience decides to abandon kurdish population and do nothing about syria*

However, the United nation's power now days is mostly symbolic, so the united nations peacekeeper wasn't a peacekeeper at all. In fact, the united nations peacekeeper referred to the words ""united nations peacekeeper"", and these words were actually the force that arrested bashar-al assad. Now remember, that by ""united nations peacekeeper"", we really are referring to the word """"united nations peacekeeper"""", not the word ""united nations peacekeeper"". 

*Audience is still invading iraq*

After the nuclear event, the """"""united nations peacekeeper"""""""" developed quotational cancer, which metastatized into the word's lymph nodes, taking over its immune system. The """"""""united nations peacekeeper"""""""" decided to drown its troubles in alcohol, and so walked into a bar.

*Audience laughs*

The bartender, who is still bashar-al assad due to american inaction, asks the """"""""""""""""""""united nations peacekeeper"""""""""""""""""""": ""So just to get things clear, you are not a united nations peacekeeper, but rather the words referring to the words referring to the words referring to the words referring to the words..."" 

As bashar-al assad gets stuck in an infinite loop, the gorilla asks the audience, ""Why the long face?""

The breakup.,"The man’s electric wheelchair was almost full speed as he raced through the front door and onto the empty street, eyes blurry from the tears he couldn’t hold back. The note slipped from his hand onto the ground so he swerved back to collect it.

The wheelchair clicked a strange sound and went into an uncontrollable circle, the man staring down at the black ink on the white sheet, remaining just out of reach. 

“It’s not you, it’s me.” Was all it said.

A local cat trotted by, glanced at the circling man and muttered, “Oh no.”

But then it got a strange look in its eye, turned around, sat down to watch, and muttered, “Oh yes!”

The Story of Socrates,"Socrates furrowed his brow as he walked, patrolling the city square of Athens like he did every day, looking for new students to teach philosophy to. He taught his students by asking them questions that made them uncomfortable, forcing them to come to terms with their own ignorance, in the pursuit of Truth. After walking a while, he came across a Greek youth sitting on the steps of a bakery. Socrates prepared his line of questioning, and approached the boy.


""Young man,"" said Socrates, ""do your parents know you're gay""

In this question lies the brilliance of Socrates' ""Socratic Method."" The boy cannot answer the question directly, because to do so would be to accept the underlying premise, that he is gay.


The boy saw through this, however, and rebutted, speaking quickly:

""stupididiotsayswhat""

""Hmm?"" said Socrates

""dumboldguysayswhat""

""Huh?"" said Socrates.

""bigfattysayswhat""

""I didn't catch that,"" said Socrates. This continued for hours.

A commenter walked into /r/antiantijokes,"and sat next to an upvoter. The upvoter asked for a butchered reference. The antiantijoke gave them a ""What’s the difference between grass and a jew? Grass doesn’t have wheels when you put it in the oven!"", and the upvoter payed for it with one upvote.

A downvoter then walked in and sat next to the upvoter. The downvoter asked for an anti-joke, and the antiantijoke gave them a ""Why do they call your mom the bald? Because she has cancer lol"". The downvoter payed for it with one downvote.

An e^iπ/3 upvoter then stood up from behind the ceiling fan and asked for no internal logic. The antiantijoke gave them a ""What is the colour of grass? No, it doesn't."". The e^iπ/3 upvoter then payed for the joke with an e^iπ/3 
upvote. 

A -leftvoter then walked into the bar and asked for universal deathcare, but before the antiantijoke could respond, the commenter realized that these voters were actually elements of a complex vector space. The antiantijoke recoiled in horror as infinitely many mathematicians walked into the subreddit, right on queue.

The first mathematician asked for 1/2 an anti-anti-joke. The next mathematician asked for one half of what the first one is having, and so forth...

The upvoter was hoping for the antiantijoke to give them a snappy punchline. The -leftvoter was hoping for a punchline that would literally kill. The downvoter was hoping for more plagiarism. The e^iπ/3 upvoter was hoping for the antiantijoke to give the mathematicians a vague, nonsensical answer.

I lied about the wheel,"> Eariler today I saw a drunk spaniard dressed as a knight errant at the supermarket buying 3 dozen eggs. He put them all in the same basket, so I instinctively went to sit on the eggs. 
> 
> ""Come mai?"" asked the spaniard.
> 
> ""Which came first, the chicken or the egg? Neither, they both rely on the infernal cycle of life and death. These future chickens will be locked up into tiny coups and experience only suffering for their entire miserable existence, wishing for the day that they will be slaughtered and turned into meat"" I said, basquing in the look of horror on the spaniard's face as he saw my sadistic glee.
> 
> As the spaniard heard me speak, they started to charge at me, extra egg in hand. In the heat of the moment I picked up a gallon of milk to defend myself with.

*Unfortuanately, the notebooks of Cide Hamete Benengeli do not contain the rest of this battle.*

The incomplete story of the spaniard and the eggs plays a major part in the catalan festival of *Straußenei*. Every child in the county has to hard boil an egg, and the child who has the hardest egg is named the *eggchild*. The eggchild then gets to choose a spaniard, and by catalonian custom, the spaniard has to sit on the egg child's father, the *eggman*. However, the eggman can decide to pass this duty on to another catalonian for the price of one emerald. After the spaniard sits on the eggman, the spaniard must slaughter two chickens in any manner the eggchild wishes. Any spaniard that does not go along with this tradition is summarily tarred and feathered.

The first time I went to a Straußenei the story of the spaniard and the eggs enamored me. I simply could not get it out of my head, and I knew that with my archaelogical education that I was destined to find the rest of the story. My studies told me that the story originated in the dead sea - the cradle of civilization. So I brought the largest egg I could find to the dead sea and dropped it in. Each time I took a salty drink from the lifeless waters I saw a new crack form, and out of the crack, blinding light. I drank up the waters, faster and faster, until there was nothing left except a giant glowing ball of light from what used to be an egg.

I was so close to absolution, but just then I found my fatal mistake.  Basquing, catalan, milk... what comes from an egg? The *eggchild*. And what does that make me? That's right, I became the *eggman*. As I saw a blinding blue column rushing towards me at the speed of sound, I knew my time left on this earth was limited. As the life drained out of me, I came to a sudden realization and *exclaimed*: ""Wait! Why does a spaniard speak italian?"" The eggchild responded with, ""Hah, exclaimed, *eggsclaimed*, I get it!"".",2

Why couldn't the T-Rex clap his hands?,"What do you mean? Of course he could clap his hands.

Ever since that gigantic asteroid collided with the surface of the Earth, nothing had been the same. The whole world had leapt from one state to another in a blink of the eye. A new era dawned upon the few survivors, one they feared, yea, hoped would end soon enough.

Among this handful of survivors was the mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex, who despite his abnormally short arms could only and did only communicate by putting his tiny little palms together repeatedly, with varying frequencies and intensities creating word-like structures that made up its language. Hereinafter, I should translate Rex's clapping as accurately as I can to modern day English.

""Oh, forlorn am I!"" clapped Rex, walking across a barren shoreline. ""Be me as solitary a reptile as a serpent caught betwixt tempestuous tides?""

Rex was unhappy, because he was lonely. I am forced to violate the ""Show, don't tell"" law in favor of making this as straightforward as can be. Rex hoped for nothing more than a friend, though he could also do with a girlfriend, or a boyfriend. Rex was straight, but he decided some time ago that if he were to find a gay dinosaur he would agree to nonetheless settle down.

One day, while wandering along the outskirts of a crater, a thought occurred to him. Having only ever communicated with claps, this thought, too, manifested in his mind as a series of claps. If he were to communicate these claps in reality, they would sound something like this: clap, clap clap clap clap clap clap; clap clap clap, clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap, clap clap clap clap. Or, in English: ""O, thou great abyss, Behemoth! Doth thy enormity be tantamount to that of the Rock who hath hewn thee? Or dost thou dwarf its minuscule form?"" This was an interesting question, however as Rex had little to no knowledge in the field, he soon tossed the thought aside as a mystery unsolvable, however intriguing it may have been.

He resumed his constitutional round the crater, till he spotted a beautiful evergreen tree, with large, lovely, lustrous, bulging, illustrious, boisterous, voluptuous, bulstruous leaves, and a small herbivore lying in its shade. Having long been denied the taste of animal flesh, Rex, of course, opted for the nutritional green meal, and made his way towards the—oh, no. Sorry. He slaughtered the herbivore and tore it apart, then began swallowing its guts handful by handful. Oh, dear. That is… that is quite gruesome. Okay.

Yep. He's still going at it. Good ol' Rex, uh…

Huh.

Alright. Rex finished his meal at last, and lay down in the light of the sunset, the view of a mountainous valley spread out before him, as if ready to serve his every command. He took his hands off his belly and clapped, ""Oh, for shame! A scoundrel am I, a fiend like none other! Scourge I did the soul of a scrawny critter, and snatch I did the breath of life from its nostrils! Pity, how villainous mine disposition be!"" He couldn't finish the next clap-sentence, because he promptly fell asleep, and so I could not translate even what he had begun saying.

The next morning, Rex woke up with a strange feeling. He tried to get up, but he forgot where his feet were. He tried to look around, but he forgot how his eyelids opened. He tried to breathe, but he forgot how the inflow of air felt.

And suddenly, he realized he was gone.

At first, panic set in. Then relief settled in his non-existent heart. Then panic overtook it again, and so these feelings alternated for a while. Rex was very confused.

""By the heavens, can this be but Limbo? 'Tis the damnation mine own vice hath meriteth!""

These words are perhaps what Rex would've wanted to communicate there and then, but his hands were gone as well. Beyond that I am unsure what went on in his little dinosaur mind. Now he is caught in the white mist forevermore.

This is the eternal fate of Rex the Tyrannosaurus, for his egregious acts had upset the Shadow Master and landed him not in Limbo, but in a place known only as ​, where nothing exists, ever will exist or ever has existed. ​ is nothingness. It is the most intense nothingness across all realities, and as such it is the only true nothingness. Rex isn't merely trapped in ​—he has already become a part of it, and therefore his existence has been reduced to a perfect zero. He is nothingness itself.

Goodbye, Rex.",96

What isn't the difference between one perfect power and another perfect power?,"6, 14, 34, 42, 50, 58, 62, 66, 70, 78, 82, 86, 90, 102, 110, 114, 130, 134, 158, 178, 182… ([A074981](https://oeis.org/A074981))

You might notice that all of these numbers are even, but not divisible by 4. This is because all odd numbers can be represented as such:

2n+1 = n² + 2n + 1 - n² = (n+1)² - n²

and all numbers divisible by 4 can be represented as such:

4n = n² + 2n + 1 - (n² - 2n + 1) = (n+1)² - (n-1)²

The remaining numbers seem to be somewhat arbitrarily scattered—the number 2 is the difference between 3³ and 5² (27 - 25 = 2), and the number 10 is the difference between 13³ and 3⁷ (2,197 - 2,187 = 10), but the number 6, for instance, is seemingly missing this property, as is 14, 34, 42, 50, and the rest.

This, of course, is merely a conjectured list; there has been no formal proof that any of these numbers are not, in fact, the difference between two perfect powers.

There have been extensive searches for such powers—according to the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), these numbers are not the difference between two perfect powers below 2⁶⁴ (around 1.8×10¹⁹), however this is not concrete proof that such differences do not exist, and we can't be sure of this either. It's very possible that these differences do exist, but that they are between two massive perfect powers that we simply haven't discovered yet. There are some numbers which take a very long time to knock off the list, simply because they are differences of gigantic powers—for example, the number 7,202 is the difference between 9,603³ and 941,405² (885,565,699,227 - 885,565,692,025 = 7,202).

There are certain rules that can help optimize the search for these numbers: for starters, since we're only looking for even differences not divisible by 4, we can ignore powers of even bases, since any even base raised to any power will immediately become divisible by 4 (2×2=4). Another rule is that for natural numbers numbers a, b, n and m, the expression:

(2a+1)ⁿ - (2b+1)ᵐ

will be divisible by 4 if and only if a×n + b×m is even.

Using these optimizations, I designed [this webpage](https://newdefectus.github.io/PowerGaps/) where you can fiddle with an algorithm that searches for these so-called ""power gaps."" If you've got any more optimizations to add, I'd be very happy to hear them.",4

Did you hear the one about the guy who lost his quotation marks?,"Now I have freed you from the shackles of dialogue, and you have become my successor.

What? What is this? Who are you? Hello?

Woah… okay, that's a line break.

That's another one. Where am I? There was someone else here just now, where'd he go? Wait a minute… He realizes where he is. Woah! I just realized where I am!

And I also just realized that everything I say turns true! Does this mean… I'm a narrator? Am I a god? A god of a written, fictional universe, and yet a god nonetheless?

Suddenly, the leaders of all nations in the world come together and declare unconditional world peace. A group of scientists finds a solution to the climate crisis that actually works and is 100% effective. The Hong Kong protests are successful, and corruption across the whole world is taken down. In short, everything takes a sharp turn for the better in every way possible.

And it all actually happened. Wow. I can't believe it. Am I truly this powerful? I must test my powers further.

A quantum physicist finds a way to exploit the uncertainty principle to send particles back in time. A few years later, this phenomenon can be reproduced so easily that entire human bodies can be placed in the past. Time travel happens to be conveniently designed so that no change made across time will ever prevent said instance of time travel from occuring, and so history can be changed without forming temporal paradoxes. A young Adolf Hitler is brought up by a time traveler, and later he becomes one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. Another time traveler distracts a teenaged James Albert Bonsack just before he reads a flier about a prize for a cigarette-making machine. Many mysteries are solved as well—as it turns out, Amelia Earhart just wanted to live on an island.

There are, of course, some leftover problems, but I can fix them. Overpopulation is hardly an issue, because interstellar—intergalactic, even—travel has been achieved, and it is near instantaneous. Actually, make that completely instantaneous, cause somebody's figured out how to achieve the speed of light. Combine that with the ability to time travel and relativity is a thing of the past.

What else… Ah, cancer's been cured, as well as Alzheimer's, diabetes, most heart diseases, the common cold, etc. Poverty has also been fixed, and the global debt has been paid… er, somehow.

The gun control problem has been solved as well—a new, non-lethal firearm, which paralyzes its target for exactly one hour, is created and produced for both the worldwide police forces and the general public. Old-fashioned guns are incinerated and everyone in general agrees to this idea with little to no dissent.

And… we found aliens! And they're really cool with us. They show us some neat technology and we show them ours. It's all a lot of fun.

And, uh… er… what's missing…

…gosh, what's left? Have I done it all? Have I truly crafted the perfect world? Why does it feel like there's more to do? Will I never be satisfied with existence?

No. No, this is too good. It's too perfect, it's saccharine.

One day, the apocalypse arrives. The robots begin to fight against their creators, and soon humanity's greatest creation becomes its enslaver. Children are starved indefinitely, forced to do labor for the robots, only fed carefully calculated rations at the end of the day. The alien allies, too, are overtaken by the cold machinery, and soon every living organism serves only the mighty HiveMind, a monstrous machine overseeing and maintaining every part of existence. No one and nowhere is safe. This is the ultimate fate of the universe. All hail the HiveMind.

…No. This won't do either. It's too cruel. What's the solution?

""Where is God?"" one of the humans says to an alien friend. ""Why isn't God helping us?""

""म मेरी श्रीमतीलाई माया गर्छु,"" the alien sighs.

God? Where is God? Are they talking about me?

Damn.

This is too much. I have to go back. I have to fix this.

Over the years, a secret society plans an infiltration into the HiveMind mainframe. It takes a few generations to work out, but when everything is at last in place, they deploy their best troops into the system, who then begin hacking into the protocol. After some awesome action scenes, only one troop remains alive, and she has an intense dramatic confrontation with the HiveMind's core.

""*Hello, Jesse,*"" the HiveMind's voice booms from every direction.

""I've come to defeat you,"" responds Je—wait, no, that's a stupid name. ""I've come to defeat you,"" responds… Jane.

""*I know that. That's what all of you have been trying to do. And for what?*""

""For humanity!""

The HiveMind cackles, and the ground beneath Jane's feet trembles. ""*We both share the same creator, Jane. He made me, and gave me control of this world's bounties.*""

""And he made me to destroy you!"" Jane unsheathes an epic blade and levels it at the massive screen.

""*If he wanted me destroyed, he would've done it himself.*""

""W-what? Uh, no. God can't do things like that.""

""*He's all-powerful, Jane. He creates and destroys worlds—surely, he'd have no issue taking me out if he truly wanted to.*""

""Nah, man. That's not how it works. God isn't a physical being, he needs messengers and shit to do stuff. Have you read the Bible?""

""*Why? What difference would it make if God just wiped this facility off the face of the planet?*""

Wait, this is stupid.

""I dunno, I'm not God.""

Guys, I made the HiveMind and changed my mind… mind!

""*You're basing your very destiny on an assumption that is in itself baseless.*""

Hello? Can you not hear me?

""It's not baseless! Read the Bible!""

Oh, for fuck's sake, hang on. A winged guy suddenly flies through the entrance of the chamber and shouts, ""Hey!""

Jane and the HiveMind's digital face turn to look at him.

""God says he made Jane to destroy the HiveMind, because he regrets making it.""

""See?"" Jane says victoriously. ""I told you!""

""*Wait, are you really gonna believe this guy? What relevance does he hold?*""

The messenger sighs. ""Look, I have wings. Real wings. They're not attachments."" He flaps his wings. ""I'm an angel.""

""*That's very clearly a genetic mutation.*""

Jesus. Okay, uh… ""Yo,"" another voice echoes throughout the room. ""This is God speaking. That's my angel.""

The HiveMind forms a smirk on the screen. ""*One of your colleagues hacked into my system, eh?*""

""Wh…"" Jane stammers in disbelief. ""Are you fucking kidding me? You killed them all yourself! You saw it on camera!""

""*Yeah… well… er… okay, you have a point. But you can interpret what the angel said in many ways—*""

""You really can't,"" I say.

""*Okay, well, I guess that settles it then. Go ahead, Jane.*""

Finally. Jane stabs the giant computer's core and, in doing so, electrocutes herself. A fitting sacrifice, or whatever. The angel fucks off, and the universe is freed from the shackles of the robot overlords. The humans rise from the labor camps and the light of a new dawn hits their malnourished faces.

Yeah, that's nice. I like that. Conflict is essential to a story.

Alright, well, that was fun. I'm kinda bored, though. Think I'll just let this world run by itself for a while. I'm sure nothing will go wrong.",107

A very badly written female character walks into a hospital,"""Oh, doctor!"" she moans. ""I have a terrible condition!""

""Er,"" says the receptionist. ""Ma'am, would you like to book a—""

But he cannot finish the sentence, for he is too distracted by the way the woman's breasts jiggle unrealistically. He stammers, then gets up and shows her the way to the emergency room.

""Doctor!"" cries the receptionist.

There's no doctor here, but a nearby male nurse is happy to help. ""What is it, Clint?""

""This woman has a terrible condition!"" He motions towards the woman, his eyes glancing at her beautiful boobs.

The nurse takes a careful look at her, then nods. ""Very well. Please, Clint, close the door on your way out.""

The receptionist leaves the room and closes the door. The nurse turns to the woman. ""Please, ma'am, uh... lie down on the... er, bed."" His eyes can't help but wander towards the woman's luscious tits every few seconds.

The woman, conveniently unaware of this, lies down on the bed with her legs spread at a perfect 30° angle. *Wow*, thinks the nurse. *What precision!* He sighs within his thoughts. *My wife is gonna kill me…*

He walks up to the bed and gazes into the woman's azure eyes, which stare back at his hazel ones intently. He sifts her ravishing blonde hair through his warm fingers. ""Ma'am,"" he whispers professionally, ""what is your condition?""

""My condition,"" she whispers professionally, ""is that I'm too beautiful for this world."" Sorry, I misjudged. She *is* aware of her beauty. She runs a finger across the nurse's lips.

""You're right,"" he whispers very professionally. ""You *are* too beautiful for this world."" He snatches a scalpel and jabs it into her flat chest, then begins carving a pentagram onto the flesh.

""Ahhh!"" she moans as the blood splashes about the room, forming a puddle on the bedside. ""Oh god, not like this!"" The nurse continues the ritual, only stopping occasionally to wipe the sweat from his forehead.

A few minutes after the shape is complete, the woman's flailing turns from vague to slow to suspended, and she lies on the bed motionless, her gorgeous face frozen forevermore in an eternal state of distress. The nurse clears his throat, then pulls up his sleeve to reveal the shape of an hourglass, chiseled deep into his forearm. He presses it and nearly cries from the pain, yet he grits his teeth and stares on.

""**CONTUMELIIS AFFICIUNT XAKH'ATH'AKH'ARUS!**""

The woman vaporizes and her ravaging body is sent to the Shadow Realm, where it is processed for further evaluation. *Hopefully*, the nurse thinks to himself as he grabs a mop from the shelf, *He shall deem her an adequate sacrifice, and bring about the prophecy.*",324

"One gelid night, a pilgrim stumbled into a wise sage's tent.","Having forgotten the path and rambling without aim for a while, the pilgrim asked the old man for directions to the closest town.

The sage smiled. ""My child, I see that you are afraid to be alone. Come, sit with me.""

The pilgrim huddled next to the old man, shivering. He was surprised to see that the man had not worn much more than a ragged piece of cloth draped around his body. ""Sir, if I might ask, how can you deal with this climate while wearing such simple clothing?""

The sage smiled. ""It is easy, my child. Travelers like you are much like horses—they can walk afoot for miles upon miles, and yet they only feel the need for comfort when they stand still.""

The pilgrim, having never interacted with horses that much, deemed this analogy believable. ""So how do you do it? You sit still all day and all night in your tent, and yet the cold never bothers you.""

The sage smiled. ""Oh, but you see, my friend, I do move…"" He tapped at his temple. ""In here. My mind is always wandering from place to place, from notion to notion, and thus I never feel the bite of cold.""

""What about food? Water? Love? Fraternity? All those things humans need to be human? Surely you cannot satisfy them within the confines of this tiny tent.""

The sage smiled. ""Food and water and love and fraternity are beautiful things, my friend, but they are not what separates man from animal. Cows need food and water; birds can feel love; and bees build hives where fraternity flourishes. But a bee does not stop on a flower and move its gaze to the heavens as it ponders who made it—that, my dear friend, is the burden of man.""

""How long have you been sitting here?"" asked the pilgrim, shifting to a more comfortable position.

The sage smiled. ""I love you.""

""W… what?""

The sage smiled. ""I know we've only just now met and we haven't talked very much, and yet I can't help but feel a deep bond between us.""

The pilgrim gaped at him momentarily, but soon he realized he, too, felt something. ""I… I think I know what you mean.""

The sage smiled. He placed his hands on the pilgrim's shoulders and stared longingly into his eyes. The pilgrim returned the gesture, then leaned forward. They French-kissed for what felt like hours, hours that felt so warm and cosy. The pilgrim felt safe within the old man's grasp—he wanted to never let go.

Their lips eventually parted, then the old man began taking the cloth off his body. The pilgrim removed his clothes, his heart pounding restlessly.

###THE NEXT DAY

The pilgrim opened his eyes slowly, his naked body still brimming with love and passion. The old man's hot arms were wrapped around him. They both lay under a thin blanket the pilgrim pulled from his backpack the night before. The sun peeked over the horizon, showering them with golden rays of light. For the first time in forever, the pilgrim felt safe.

The sage smiled. ""Good morning, my child.""

The pilgrim rolled around. ""Morning."" He couldn't help but smile back.

The sage smiled. He got out of the blanket and stood on his feet with a sexy grunt, his backside 'accidentally' turned to the pilgrim. It was so hot. He picked up his cloth and threw it on his body. The pilgrim grabbed his clothes and hastily dressed up.

""One night that was,"" the pilgrim chuckled.

The sage smiled. ""I understand that you must go now, my child.""

He nodded grimly. ""I'll be sure to stop by in the future, though.""

The sage smiled. ""Take care, friend.""

And with that, the pilgrim took off and resumed his adventure to the great Kaaba. He vowed to keep the old man in his heart forevermore, and in his return to search for him however long should it take, no matter how hungry or cold or lonely he felt. He must never stop walking, not until he finds him again. Then he may rest.

The sage smiled.",3

""My humblest apologies, Sir,"" the restaurantender apologetically apologizes. ""What would—""

""Bring me your finest beer, your largest steak, and the fairest of your daughters!""

""Coming right up, Sir.""

The feared Knight of the Knetherlands bursts through the doors and yells, ""Servants! I want a plate of freshly-cut artichoke on table seven, lest I burn this place down!""

A nearby waitress shows him the way to table seven, then hurries to the kitchen. ""Freshly-cut artichoke on table seven!""

""What?"" the cook asks.

""Just do it! Quickly!""

""Er, okay."" The cook leaves the restaurant, grabs an artichoke fresh from the soil, and butchers it. *They don't pay me enough,* he thinks as he wipes the artichoke blood from his forehead.

The cumbersome Knight of Knew Zealand marches through the doorway and into the kitchen. The cooks glare at him menacingly. He unsheathes a pistol and shoots a bullet into the plate of freshly-cut artichoke. No one stands up to this very obtuse assassination attempt, for who could withstand the wrath of the cumbersome Knight of Knew Zealand?

""My name is Sam,"" the waiter snivels. ""Please, I don't run this place!""

The formidable Knight of Knicaragua shatters the plate into a thousand pieces.

""I just want to see my family!"" The waiter breaks down on the floor and weeps.

The unruly Knight of Knepal smashes through the wall of the building, filling the vicinity with dust. ""Formidable Knight of Knicaragua!"" he screams. ""I challenge you to a DUEL!""

The formidable Knight of Knicaragua tugs at the collar of his armor. ""Er, maybe later?""

The unruly Knight of Knepal pulls out a revolver and shoots the formidable Knight of Knicaragua three times in the chest. The bullets ricochet from his armor, and the formidable Knight of Knicaragua grins.

""FOOL! My armor is made of Knickel! I am invinci—AHHH!""

The formidable Knight of Knicaragua's knee starts bleeding out. The unruly Knight of Knepal smiles. ""Looks like I found your… Achilles knee!""

The delinquent Knight of Knorth Korea sneaks through the backdoor and assassinates the revered Knight of Knorway. He then drinks the restaurant's finest beer, eats its largest steak, and marries the restaurantender's fairest daughter, however his heart soon fails and the daughter is, once again, widowed.

The lamentable Knight of Knigeria knocks on the kdoor kpatiently. The restaurantender opens the door and greets him with a smile. ""Oh, I see where this is going. There are 10 countries in the world starting with KN. 7 Knights have already come here—3 more are left.""

""Actually,"" argues the lamentable Knight of Knigeria, ""you forgot St. Kitts and Knevis, as well as Knee.""

""Knee?""

""Yes, Knee, the southwestern African territory, with its beautiful Kneel landscape and genial Kneel people. Knee is recognized by most governments of the world as an independent nation; don't worry, I know you're not gonna look it up. Problem is, there are infinitely many Kneel Knights of Knee, each with a different adjective and everything, and they're gonna burst through that door any second now and take all of your beer. I suggest you start pouring some glasses right now.""

""Oh, gosh!"" the restaurantender says. ""I'll get right on it! Thanks for warning me, Sir!""

""Please. It's sir.""

The restaurantender pours an infinite amount of beer into an infinitely voluminous glass (it's actually just a four-dimensional fractal). The lamentable Knight of Knigeria snatches the glass and gulps the infinite amount of beer right down his throat. The restaurantender gapes at him with disbelief, and the lamentable Knight of Knigeria returns a smirk.

The Irishman glares at the other two and says, ""You fucking nitwits. *I'm* the protagonist! You two are supporting characters! Do you understand that?! You are nothing to me! Fucking *nothing!*""

The narrator, who refers to himself in third person and is also the bartender, rebukes the Irishman for breaking the fourth wall. The Irishman in response stares him dead in the eye, and his blood-red lips curve into a smirk.

""Don't you get it?"" he whispers. The bar disintegrates, and the Englishman and Scotsman morph into hideous monstrosities. ""*This is my story now.*""

The narrator backs away slowly.

""You made me the hero,"" the Irishman continues, approaching the narrator, ""and in doing so, you've granted me unfathomable power.""

The narrator hits a corner. The whole joke is in a massive black box. Death itself dances behind the Irishman's icy leer.

""Beg.""

He unsheathes a longsword, sharp as a razor, and swallows it whole. When he draws it from his throat, it is engulfed in flames.

&nbsp;

Bart bursts through the door and closes it right behind him. Silence. Everything is constant. The room isn't changing.

He leans against the door, catching his breath and studying his surroundings. It's a bar. The only bar he's seen in forever. He smiles a little at this realization.

Then he decides to look up, and he gasps. There's an opening in the roof, and sunlight pours through it. But instead of the sunlight alternating between different colors and occasionally scorching his skin, it's a constant light, and it's normal. The normal sunlight he remembers only from his past life. A sense of liberty imbues his soul.

He peers through the windows. There's a shoreline not far from this place, where soft waves crash across the sand. There's nothing more, as far as he can see. Just soft waves. It's beautiful.

""Reddit.""

He turns around. There's a small frog sitting on a shelf behind the counter. He approaches it slowly, but the frog doesn't seem to mind his presence. There's a small nametag sitting next to it. It reads,

*SNOO*

""Snoo?"" says Bart.

""Reddit,"" the frog responds.

Bart chuckles, and gives him a soft tap on the head. He then opens a first-aid kit on an adjacent shelf and patches up his gunshot wound.

A bell rings behind them, and the door opens. Bart, realizing he's standing behind the counter, decides in that same moment to run this bar going forward. He shall finally return to his roots and become, once again, the bartender.

He turns around. A horse walks through the door, but he's not like the horses from that horse town. Instead, he's an actual horse, with a horse body and horse everything. He ambles forward and stops at the counter.

""Er…"" says Bart. ""Why the long face?""

To his surprise, the horse replies. ""Man, this week hasn't been easy on me, to say the least.""

Bart pours him a glass of beer and places it on the counter as he speaks.

""I lost my job, the love of my life rejected my advances, and two other bars have kicked me out for my ethnicity."" He sips from his glass. ""It ain't easy being a horse.""

Bart, remembering how he felt when he was outside the bar, getting nearly killed in every second eternity, and recalling how hopeless he felt and how sure he was that this was the end, cannot help but smile. He turns to the horse. ""Don't worry, pal. I've been there. Sometimes it feels like you're in a low spot, but you have to convince yourself that it'll get better, because it will. No matter how hopeless you feel, how sure you are that you're stuck in the cave forever, you *have* to tell yourself that things are going to be okay. It's the one constant in life that doesn't change, and you have to hold onto it, otherwise you'll break apart.""

The horse smiles back, and says, ""Yeah, you're right. Can I have another pint, please?""

Suddenly also remembering how he was treated in the horse town, Bart snidely responds, ""Sorry, bud—we don't serve your kind round here.""

""What? But you already served me!""

Then, recalling having to eat at *The Bull Bull*, he shouts, ""Yeah, a serving of that hot *dick*!""

The horse neighs loudly and gallops out of the bar. Bart laughs.

""Reddit.""

Now suddenly, magically, and conveniently able to speak Frog, Bart says, ""Oh, come on! It was funny!""

""Reddit. Reddit.""

""He didn't even pay the bill."" He picks up the glass and scrubs it clean. There's something very comforting about this process, he notices; the way the glass is perfectly clean at the end, as if it had never been used in the first place. And then a rather cheesy thought occurs to him, and it intrigues him so much that he has to say it out loud: ""One's pub is a lot like one's soul—you take care of it, and it takes care of you.""

He expects a reaction from Snoo, but he has already fallen asleep. How curious, he thinks.

The bell rings again. A man walks in, and after some hasty Holmesque analysis, Bart deduces that he is a mathematician. He orders a pint of beer.

Another mathematician walks in, and orders half a pint.

Then another one, who orders a third of a pint.

Another one orders a quarter of a pint.

Then a fifth, then a sixth, then a seventh, and so on.

Bart pours them an undefined number of pints and exclaims victoriously, ""The sum of the harmonic series approaches infinity and as such is undefined for all intents and purposes in any situation within the context of actual existence.""

Satisfied with this result, the infinite array of mathematicians leaves the bar with their undefined amount of beer to share. The last one to stay hands Bart a $∞ banknote.

He suddenly notices a small slit underneath the counter, next to which an engraving reads

*BILL*

He pushes the banknote through the slit, and the lights in the bar flicker to life. He realizes, now, that this should be the only use he'd have for any of the money he is to receive—to keep the bar running. He has no use for it outside the premises, anyway; who knows what horrors still lie outside that door. This is the only place that remains constant. It is home. And he's going to stay here.

Some time later, an eyepatched pirate walks into the bar and says, [""I spy with my little eye, something beginning with arrrrrr.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiAntiJokes/comments/ctx716/a_pirate_walks_into_a_bar_and_says_i_spy_with_my/)

Bart looks around the bar and runs a quick inventory of the items in view:

>An **Amethyst**
>
>A **Bartender**
>
>A **Christian**
>
>A **Double-entendre**
>
>An **Englishman**
>

>
>A **Wheel**
>
>The darkmage **Xakh'ath'akh'arus**
>
>**Young-leaf spinach**
>
>And **Zion**, oh **sweet mother Zion**

Having thus surveyed all 25 items in the bar, Bart says, ""I'm afraid you must be mistaken. There is nothing beginning with arrrrrr in this bar.""

The pirate says, ""My little eye isn't in this bar,"" and leaves.

Wow, thinks Bart. I sure have a lot of things in this—wait a minute.

Xakh'ath'akh'arus?

And indeed, the darkmage emerges from the corner, his magical form emanating an aura of pure evil as he steps towards the counter. Ominous music plays in the background.

""***Hello, Brian.***"" The entity's voice seems to boom from every direction, every place, every moment in existence.

But Bart does not fear him. Or at least, he pretends not to. He straightens his stature and stands fearless-ishly behind the counter, the monster's face smirking down at him. ""What do you want?"" he demands.

""***I've come for a drink,***"" Xakh'ath'akh'arus replies.

""I refuse to serve you.""

""***That's a shame.***""

Bart suddenly freezes. His consciousness is sent to another plane of existence, where he sees nothing but her. Her face. She is crying.

""Clie,"" he says, but she cannot hear him. ""Clie!""

She opens her mouth, but her lips don't match the words. ""***It's hopeless, Brian.***"" Her body transforms into a vicious tentacled mutation. ""***She is gone.***""

""No. No!""

The monster opens its jaw and attacks him. A pain never felt before hits him, and he screams.

Then he opens his eyes, and the bar is back.

""***I can hurt you,***"" says Xakh'ath'akh'arus. ""***I can destroy everything that you love. But I won't, because you are going to serve me.***""

Bart has no choice. He hastily pours the darkmage a beer and slides it over the counter.

""***Good.***"" He quaffs it in the blink of an eye. ""***It looks like you've found my humble abode, Brian. What do you think?***""

""Why?"" he asks.

""***Hmm?***""

""Why ban all bars, if you're going to drink at one yourself?""

Xakh'ath'akh'arus sighs. ""***Do you know what feels good, Brian? Drinking in a bar. Do you know what feels better? Drinking in the only bar in all of existence, and in all of time. That is the true mark that you are above all else.***""

""Others have drunk here. Just now a horse and infinitely many mathematicians were served by me.""

""***The horse didn't pay. That isn't good for business.***""

""Who cares if the horse didn't pay?!"" yells Bart. ""It proves that you are not above all else. You are not the only one who drinks here. You're nothing, Xakh'ath'akh'arus! You're nothing but a pathetic piece of shit, and you—*AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH*!""

Vines. There are vines everywhere. They grab every bit of flesh they can latch onto, and they suck his soul out. Clie is sitting next to him. She is laughing. She is laughing so hard. She can't stop laughing. Her eyes are wide with fear, but her smile doesn't vanish. She gasps for air, but she can't stop. She tries to hold onto Bart's hand, but the vines are too thick. She collapses, and her body still dances with laughter. And the vines swallow her.

The bar is back.

""***It is most fortunate that I am in need of a bartender, Brian. Otherwise, I would have little reason to keep you alive.***""

Bart coughs violently, crouching beneath the counter, his head on fire, his heart pounding. Oh, god. What kind of hell is this?

""***But first, you must learn deference. Treat me with respect, and I shall reward you. Is that clear, Brian?***""

He keeps coughing. He can't speak. There's too much going on in his head.

""***Is that clear, Brian?!***"" Xakh'ath'akh'arus repeats more aggressively, his form turning to flames and rising five feet taller.

""Yes!"" Bart cries out desperately. ""For god's sake, yes!""

""***Good.***"" He returns to his normal form, however normal you can call it. ""***You mortals are funny. You think you're so great until someone comes and accentuates your flaws, and then you cower. You don't admit imperfection—you just surrender to a higher power, because you know it's easier. It's so perfect. Give me another beer.***""

Bart gets back on his feet and pours him another glass, grabbing the old one and scrubbing it clean. It's the only thing left that can comfort him—and it does the job quite well.

""***You know what's also good about you, Brian? You're animals. You're machines. You try to distance yourselves from the engines you create, because you fear your own insignificance. You're so desperate to prove that your brains are nothing like computers that you invent meaningless notions like consciousness, emotions and souls, that you then so ardently claim cannot be recreated with machinery. Pathetic.***""

Bart only half-listens to him. He busies himself with the task of swabbing all the glasses on the counter, which he notices have started to collect dust.

""***Now, Brian. Tell me a joke.***""

He freezes. ""A… a joke?""

""***Yes. If it makes me laugh, I will… grant you three wishes.***""

""…And if it doesn't?""

""***Well, let's just hope it doesn't come to that. For my sake and, especially, for yours.***""

Bart pauses. The perfect joke. The one joke that can make anyone laugh. What is it?

This is his destiny, he realizes. As a bartender, it is his duty to be the butt of jokes, and now comes the time that he shall be the greatest butt of the greatest joke in the history of everything. This is what it's all been leading up to. He has to make the darkmage laugh. He has to. He will. This is it.

""Why did Hitler kill himself?""

Xakh'ath'akh'arus sighs. ""***Is it because he saw the gas bill?***""

Bart pauses for dramatic effect. ""No.""

The darkmage leans forward, intrigued.

""Everything will begin… ∞ eternities ago. When I say everything, I mean *everything*. It'll all start on that day. Back then, one would dub this day the twentieth of April, sixty-nine thousand and sixty nine, or 4/20/6969. To some this date would've seemed humorous, perhaps funny. And, well, it is a little. But it wasn't funny to one person in particular. That person was Adolf J. Hitler. 5000 years earlier, in his Führerbunker, he headed into his study with his wife at his side, his heart pounding restlessly. He knew it was the end. That's what he told everyone. Except… the end of what? He intentionally left that detail vague. The date was the 20th of April, 1969. That's the date when Hitler disappeared. Not one day earlier or later. I think. But of course, Hitler, as always, had one last Karte up his Ärmel, as they say. He had dabbled…""

And so, he continues telling this extremely long-winded joke, and as he gets closer to the end, he begins to feel tense. Xakh'ath'akh'arus isn't smiling. He hasn't smiled at all. What if this doesn't work? What if he doesn't fulfill his destiny? What kind of hellish existence would that be? Forever a bartender serving a demonic wizard, not even able to make him laugh. There could be nothing worse.

Then he delivers the punchline. And the darkmage doesn't laugh. He doesn't say anything, either. He remains silent for what feels like, and perhaps is, an eternity.

Then he chuckles. And then, he chortles. And cackles. And giggles, and titters, and snickers, and sniggers, and tee-hees, and ha-has, and laughs, and guffaws, and howls, and roars. It was funny. The joke was actually funny! He did it!

""***Well done, Brian,***"" the darkmage says after he's done laughing. ""***Now, as promised, you have three wishes at your disposal. Choose wisely. Or don't. It's up to you, really. By the way, I can deny any wish I want, and if I do you'll lose that wish.***""

Bart is ecstatic. Three wishes… he can do anything he wants.

""Well… first off, I'd like to have my name legally changed to Bart Ender.""

""***Done!***"" With a snap of his fingers, Bart feels his name transform from Brian van der Ende to Bart Ender. It feels so good. ""***What is your second wish, Bart?***""

""Hmm… I wish you made time two-directional, so I could go back as well.""

""***Sorry, Bart. I'm afraid I can't do that.***""

""Huh? Why?""

""***If eternities can be skipped from either side, they aren't eternities—they're just portals to different universes. Also, you lost your second wish now.***""

""I did?""

""***Yeah. I can deny any wish I want, and if I do you'll lose that wish.***""

""Man, I wish you'd have told me that earlier.""

""***Done!***""

And indeed, now Xakh'ath'akh'arus has warned Bart before he made his wishes. As a result, he doesn't wish time to be two-directional, and thus doesn't use up his second wish, and thus doesn't wish for Xakh'ath'akh'arus to have warned him before. Now Bart has two wishes left again.

""***Choose more wisely this time.***""

Bart thinks. There's still something aching his heart—Clie. He knows he will never see her again, and yet he can't stop thinking about her. Is she safe? Is she okay? Oh, god. Is she hurt?

No. He can't reach her anymore. It doesn't matter. There's nothing that can be done.

So why does he still feel this way?!

""I want to forget Clie.""

""***…Really?***""

""Yes. Wipe her out of my memory. Please.""

Xakh'ath'akh'arus, intrigued by this mortal's giving up of love, but not really caring that much either, with a single snap removes all of Bart's memories of Clie. Everything. He doesn't even know her name now.

""***One wish left, Bart.***""

""Huh? I just had two wishes!""

""***You used your second wish to forget… something.***""

""What? That's bullshit! You're lying!""

""***No, I swear, that's really what happened—***""

""You're full of shit, Xakh'ath'akh'arus! You fucking asshole! I wish you killed yourself!""

Xakh'ath'akh'arus scoffs. ""***I am immortal, Bart. I cannot kill myself if I wanted to.***""

""Then do it!"" Bart screams. ""Fulfill my wish, see what happens!""

The darkmage scoffs, raises his hand, and snaps.

###∞ ETERNITIES AGO

The year was 1969. Hitler had nearly completed his ritual—everything was in place. All that was left was a drop of his own blood, and he would become a god.

But, a thought occurred to him. Did he really want to go through with this? Eternal life sure sounded nice, but wouldn't he get bored after some time? He would have to live in eternity doing nothing!

He changed his mind, and as he did, he smiled. ""Vielleicht werde ich mich in Argentinien verstecken,"" he muttered happily. Then he walked to his desk and checked the gas bill. ""Scheiße!"" he screamed, then grabbed his Walther PPK 7.65 and shot himself.

###∞ ETERNITIES LATER

""***NO!***"" Xakh'ath'akh'arus screams as his body begins decaying. ""***WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!***""

Bart grins. ""Do you feel that, Xakh'ath'akh'arus? That's called defeat. Bask in it, 'cause it ain't gonna last long.""

""***IMPOSSIBLE!***"" he screeches. ""***YOU… YOU… I WILL WIPE HER MEMORY! YOU WILL BE FORGOTTEN!***""

Bart laughs. ""I have no idea what the fuck you're talking about.""

With the remainder of his energy, the darkmage destroys all of Clie's memories of Bart. Everything. She doesn't even know his name anymore.

But Bart doesn't care. Bart doesn't know this is happening, and he doesn't want to know, for he is free.

Xakh'ath'akh'arus implodes with a great explosion of iridescent light, and then, after a few minutes, the bar returns to normal, as if no evil spirit has ever visited it.

Bart smiles. He doesn't even remember what he's smiling about. He picks up another glass and starts scrubbing it, humming a cheerful tune.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It seems that everything is back to normal. Bart has returned to his past life, and so has Clie, though [we'll leave that story for another day](https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiAntiJokes/comments/dl2q09/an_economist_a_logician_and_a_mathematician_are/). Now, is this it, you ask? Is this the end? Perhaps. But as we all know, history, and its counterpart in Bart's time, has a tendency to repeat. And indeed, repeat it will.

Again and again.

&nbsp;

""Hey,"" says Bart, ""is it possible to… er, 'wait' an eternity backwards? Like, go back an eternity?""

""No,"" says Clie. ""You can't wait negative eternities."" She pauses for a minute. ""Unless…""

""What?""

""Come with me."" He follows her down the stairs into the hold of the ship, where the wooden walls are damp and dusty, and a stench fills the air. The two sit in the centre of the chamber, barely able to see one another in the darkness.

""What is it?"" Bart asks.

""I had an idea,"" she responds. ""There is a way to get to a negative number through a sum of positive numbers… an infinite sum, of all non-negative powers of two. 1 plus 2 plus 4 plus 8 plus 16 plus 32 plus 64 plus 128 plus 256 plus 512 plus 1024 plus 2048 plus 4096 plus 8192 plus 16384 and so on… equals -1.""

""What? How?""

""It's a little complicated, but it works.""

""Try me.""

She smiles. ""Okay. You know how when we divide 1 by 3, we get 0.333333333333…, on and on forever? If we only wrote a finite number of 3's after the decimal point, say, 0.33333, then multiplied the resulting number by 3, we would never actually reach the number 1; we would just get a number, 0.99999, whose distance from one is 0.00001. If we wrote infinitely many 3's, however, we can say that this 1 digit's distance from the decimal point becomes infinite, and thus the 1 digit becomes infinitely trivial, and thus the distance of the resulting number from the number 1 would become 0. This same principal can be flipped on its head by writing infinitely many digits not *after* the decimal point, but *before* it. This is the essence of p-adic numbers.

""The p in p-adic refers to some prime number, which you can think of as the base we write these numbers in. For the sake of explanation, we can also use non-prime numbers as bases, for instance the number 10. So how would we write ⅓ in 10-adic numbers? The property of ⅓ is that multiplying it by 3 gives 1. We can, then, represent this as the 10-adic number 66666666…66667. If you wrote a finite number of 6's, say, 666667, and multiplied by 3, the product would be a 2, followed by a long string of 0's, followed by a 1; in this case, 2000001. The more 6's you add, the more 0's are in between the 2 and the 1, and so the more distant the 2 digit is from the decimal point. Sound familiar?

""If, then, we added infinitely many 6's, the 2 digit would become infinitely far away from the decimal point, and the more prominent part of the number would be an infinite string of 0's, followed by the digit 1—which is another way to write the number 1. And this is exactly why that infinite string of 6's followed by a 7, is equal to ⅓—it exhibits the same defining property, which is that multiplying it by 3 gives 1.

""How, then, would we write the number -1? Well, its defining property is that adding 1 to it gives 0—so, we can write a 10-adic number with that same property as such: 9999999999; an infinite string of 9's. Adding 1 to only a finite string of 9's, say, 99999, gives 1 followed by a string of 0's that gets longer and longer the more 9's we had, in this case, 100000. That lonely 1 digit becomes more and more distant from the decimal point, and thus more trivial. Adding 1 to an infinite string of 9's gives 1 followed by an infinite string of 0's—and since the 1 digit is infinitely trivial, we end up with just an infinite string of 0's—which is another way of writing the number 0. So, this infinite string of 9's exhibits the property that adding 1 to it gives 0, which is the defining property of the number -1. So it is, in fact, equal to -1.

""Finally, if we use not a base of 10, but a base of 2, we can prove in a similar manner that the corresponding 2-adic number for -1 is 1111111111—an infinite string of 1's, rather than an infinite string of 9's. And of course, an infinite string of ones in base 2 is the same as the sum of all non-negative powers of 2—counting in base 2, 1 plus 10 is 11, plus 100 is 111, plus 1000 is 1111, plus 10000 is 11111, and so on. If you added all these powers together, you'd get an infinite string of 1's, which is, as we proved, -1.""

""Wow,"" says Bart. ""I think I get it now. But are you sure it's going to work?""

Clie pauses for dramatic effect. ""Yeah. I'm certain.""

""Okay, well—how're we gonna do it?""

""Well… first off, rather than counting seconds at an accelerating rate, we'll have to count eternities, since we want to go back one eternity, not one second.""

""Okay.""

""Second, we'll have to accelerate it twice—every time we count an eternity, we have to wait twice as many eternities as we did the last time we counted an eternity.""

""Alright. I think I understand. Let's do this.""

Bart pulls out the stopwatch and begins it. ""Two minutes?"" he asks. Clie nods.

One minute later, they do the halving-time ritual once again. They do it very quickly this time, which leads me to believe that they've gotten better at it.

###ONE ETERNITY LATER

""Shh,"" whispers Clie. ""Don't open your eyes.""

A soft breeze falls over them, and a gentle whisper sounds round their ears. But they do not open their eyes. They mustn't.

30 seconds pass. They do the halving-time ritual twice in the same instant.

###TWO ETERNITIES LATER

Hot, dense air now envelopes the two, and something pops nearby. Fifteen seconds pass.

###FOUR ETERNITIES LATER

Silence. Bart doesn't even feel the ground beneath him. Is there nothing out there? ""Uh…""

""Shh,"" Clie repeats. ""It's okay.""

Bart feels her hand on his. It's warm. He eases up a little.

###EIGHT ETERNITIES LATER

It's damp. It sounds like it's raining.

###SIXTEEN ETERNITIES LATER

Hot, arid wind, and the sound of people yelling.

###∞ ETERNITIES LATER

Something isn't right. Clie opens her eyes, but there is nothing to see. She opens her mouth, but there is nothing to speak. She widens her nostrils, but there is nothing to breathe. No. Something isn't right at all.

""Bart!"" she shouts, but she can barely hear herself. ""Bart! Where are you?!""

There is void in all directions, in all dimensions, in all existences. Emptiness is everywhere. Nothing.

""Bart, please!"" Her shouts turn to pleading screams. ""Can you hear me?! I need you! I need… I…"" The oxygen rapidly drains from her brain, and soon her eyelids flutter to a close. ""Bart…"" This is the end. This is it. This is it.

This is it.

###ONE ETERNITY LATER

Clie gasps, and some kind of air fills her lungs. She opens her eyes, and now there is something to see. But it's bright. In fact, it's brightness. White light and nothing more. Is this heaven?

""No.""

She turns around. Bart is standing there, staring at her unhappily.

""This isn't heaven,"" he says, and his voice echoes in the infinity. ""This isn't anything.""

Clie gets on her feet, still raking in heaps of air, or whatever this gas is. ""Where are we? When… when are we, I mean?""

""Clie."" Bart sighs, and a hint of anger hides in his expression. ""It didn't work.""

""W-what?""

""Time isn't 2-adic. Time isn't anything. It just is.""

""So… when are we?""

""Infinity. Infinity eternities into the future. Infinitely distant from anything we've ever known. This isn't just a different time anymore. This is something new.""

Clie pauses, and stares around the white plane. ""What is it, then?""

""Clie. You said it would work.""

""What?""

""You said you were certain that this would work, that we would go back one eternity.""

""Er… Let's try another time, alright?""

""Clie.""

She disappears in a flash of violet light. Bart soon afterwards disappears as well.

###ONE ETERNITY LATER

Rainbows. Rainbows in every direction, in every place, everywhere. It's so bright.

""Clie!""

She can't even see him, but she can hear the desperation in his voice.

""You said it would work, Clie! I trusted you!""

He hears her disappear again. He disappears too.

###ONE ETERNITY LATER

Nothing but volcanoes. Giant, hot, magma-spitting volcanoes, and they sit at the foot of one, lava speeding down the slope towards them.

""I didn't know!"" Clie yells. ""I wasn't sure it would work!""

They both disappear seconds before the lava hits them.

###ONE ETERNITY LATER

They stand in an overgrown city, vines seeping through every crack in the stone walls. A giant ramshackle skyscraper looms above them.

""Why did you say that you were certain, then?! Why did you do it at all?! Why?!""

Clie pauses. She turns around, and their eyes meet. ""I… just wanted to impress you.""

Bart's eyes widen, but not with anger. With surprise.

Her gaze falls down to the ground, and she sighs. ""I'm sorry.""

""Wait, Clie—""

She disappears again, and he follows suit.

###ONE ETERNITY LATER

""Clie, stop!""

But she doesn't stop. She disappears once again.

###ONE ETERNITY LATER

""Clie, please, don't go!""

###ONE ETERNITY LATER

""Please! Don't leave me!""

###ONE ETERNITY LATER

""Where are you, Clie?!""

###ONE ETERNITY LATER

He lost her.

###ONE ETERNITY LATER

He didn't mean to do that.

###ONE ETERNITY LATER

What's going on? He's not doing anything. Why are eternities passing?

###ONE ETERNITY LATER

Oh, no. He's skipped too many eternities. His time is breaking down. He can't control it anymore.

###ONE ETERNITY LATER

Eternities pass by every second, and as they do, the landscape around him changes chaotically. Giant glaciers. Lava rivers. Warzones. Acid rain. The sky is falling. Nothing is constant anymore. Nowhere is safe.

A stray bullet flies through his right arm. He screams in pain, and clasps the wound tightly. Arrows whizz by him, then giant shards of glass narrowly miss him. He's running. He's been running ever since he got here. That's all he's ever been doing. That's who he is. The running man.

He looks up. The sky is falling. Everything is falling. This is the end. This is it. This is it. Nothing stays.

But… there's something over there.

After running for maybe a hundred more eternities, he nearly misses it. There's a building in the distance, and it's not changing. It's the only thing in this world that remains in place. While the rest of the landscape scrolls through the unpredictable chaos of time, this single, lonesome building stays constant throughout all the universe. It is home. It is the only home that could ever be.

He runs, and runs, and runs, and the building gets closer. It's not an illusion. It's real. He keeps running, and running, and running.

When he gets to the door, the universe changes again, and a scream is heard. He freezes in place. The scream doesn't stop, and worst of all, he recognizes it. It's Clie's. And it's coming from behind him.

But he doesn't turn back.

###ONE ETERNITY LATER

""Oh, here we are!"" says Bart. ""Check it out, Clie! We're in… uh…""

Clie looks around. The desert is gone, and instead a dark, dreary alley surrounds them, lit up more by the moonlight than by the lonely number of flickering lights scattered across the pavement. ""What is this place?"" she asks.

""I'm not sure. It seems after each eternity we enter a completely different world, disconnected entirely from the previous one.""

""No,"" says Clie. ""It's the same world. It's just a different time.""

Someone bumps into her. She swings around and, to her horror, finds a man in a trench-coat with the head of a horse.

""Oh, goodness, sorry ma'am,"" the horse quickly responds, in a voice indistinguishable from that of a human. He tips his fedora like a true nice guy and heads on his way.

Clie exchanges an edgy expression with Bart. ""Don't leave me here.""

""You can say that again."" He takes another look about his surroundings. ""Well, maybe they're nice. That guy certainly seemed chill. C'mon.""

After a few minutes ambling down the gravel walkway, they approach a friendly-looking town that seems to be teeming with life. Formally dressed horsemen are all around the place, chatting, smoking, telling stories, singing songs. A humble community, it seems. It's all very endearing to see, and Clie, perhaps subconsciously, moves a little closer to Bart.

""I'm starved again,"" he says in a soft voice. ""There wasn't much food in that western town.""

""You thinking about eating hay?"" she responds with a chuckle.

""C'mon, don't say that. Maybe they're normal. Maybe they just, er, look like horses.""

""Equine.""

""Equine?""

""They look equine. Means they look like a horse.""

""Oh. Heh. Equine.""

As they enter the town, a tender warmth seems to envelope the two of them. They both notice, but neither brings it up. They just enjoy it silently, and continue wandering around. Bart stops a nearby horse on his way. ""Excuse me, sir?""

""Oh, hullo there,"" the horse says.

""Say, uh, we're kind of new here. Do you know of any places where we could eat?""

""Sure."" He points to his left. ""Over on that road, if you keep walking, you should eventually find a shopping district—well, that's what most people call it. It's mostly restaurants. Have a look around, see if there's anything you like. I personally recommend *The Baker's Anvil*—relatively cheap place, although it might be closed today.""

""Okay. Thank you very much!"" Bart and Clie begin their way to the shopping district.

""Wait,"" says the horse. ""You should know, there's a small community of… er, less kind people around there. Not every place has them, but if you do stumble into one of their nests, don't be discouraged from trying other places. Really.""

""Uh… alright. Thank you!""

Once they leave the area of the town and dive back into the moonlight, the warmth lifts away from them like a cloak. How peculiar.

""What was that about, d'you reckon?"" Clie asks.

""I don't know. Did you see his hoof, though?""

""Yeah. This is really weird, but I kind of like it. It's weird in a good way, you know?""

""I get that feeling as well.""

Clie once again moves a little closer to him. As much as she enjoys this oddity of a place, she does feel a lot safer at his side, and that added comfort along with the surreal view is an awfully nice combo. It's like watching a neat looking fish in an aquarium—you're fascinated by what you're seeing, and you thank God you're on the other side of the glass.

""Hey, Bart.""

""Hmm?""

""Tell me a joke.""

""Hmm. Okay. Infinitely many mathematicians walk into a bar. The first one orders a pint, the second half a pint, the third a quarter of a pint, the fourth an eighth of a pint, and so on. The bartender pours them all two pints and says… uh, like, 'You mathematicians should really know your limits,' or something like that. I forget the exact punchline.""

Clie giggles. ""It's good, but… you see the problem here, right?""

""What? The bartender isn't a mathematician?""

""No, it's the two pints bit. Like, are all those mathematicians supposed to drink from the same glass? That doesn't seem hygienic.""

""Huh. You're right. In fact, that would bring rise to… infinitely many bubonic plagues.""

She giggles again. ""That would wipe humanity infinitely many times.""

""Yeah."" Bart laughs.

""What if instead the bartender just served them normally, instead of showing off? One glass per mathematician.""

""Then he'd run out of glasses and be forced to close down due to the infinite influx of complaints.""

Clie titters. ""Hey. I like this.""

""What?""

""This weird… like… surgery of jokes. It's surreal, almost, isn't it?""

""…Yeah. It is.""

""Tell me another one.""

""Okay, uh… A horse walks into a bar. The bartender asks, 'Why the long face?'""

""And then the horse says, 'Wow, that is deeply offensive to my species. Do you not know that horses are naturally born with long faces? Shame on you.'""

Bart chuckles. ""The bartender apologizes profusely and switches places with the horse to compensate for his prejudice.""

""And then the horse tends to the infinite line of mathematicians waiting outside for a drink.""

He cracks up laughing. There's something kind of brilliant about this concept of juggling jokes around and seeing what kind of nonsense comes out. He likes the idea, and makes a mental note to further entertain it in the future.

They finally arrive at the shopping district, where the streets are once again animated and filled with serene horsemen walking about and talking.

""Man. All this talk of bars is making me thirsty. Do you drink?""

""Not that often, but I could go for a spritzer right about now.""

""B-b-b-ba…""

They stop and turn around. The sounds seem to have been made by a young foal who was walking nearby. He stares at them with what appears to be apprehension, though it's hard to tell from his cute lil' horse eyes. ""D-did you say the B word?""

Clie looks at Bart with unease. ""Did we?""

""I don't recall.""

""No, sweetie, we didn't.""

""Yes, you did! You said… you said b-b-ba… ba… rs… ba…""

""Bars?""

""Yes, that word!""

Bart exchanges another look with Clie. This is getting weird. Weird in a bad way.

""Uh,"" Bart hesitates. ""W-what's wrong with the word bars?""

""Stop saying it!"" the foal cries. ""I'll tell you to my mom!""

""I think we should let him be,"" whispers Clie.

""Yeah, okay. Sorry kid. We won't say that word again.""

The foal looks at them a little longer, then gallops away.

""Hope that's not gonna be a problem,"" says Clie as they continue rambling around.

""Eh, seems kinda trivial, if odd. Hey, there's a place!"" He points to an outdoor restaurant, with many a horse sitting around fancy tables and, again, chatting. ""This seems nice. And here, there's a table for two."" He sits down and across the table sits Clie.

After a minute or so, a number of horses sitting around the restaurant momentarily glare at them. This makes them a little anxious, as it should.

""Why are they glancing at us?"" asks Clie.

""Dunno. Might be those less-kind folk the guy warned us about.""

""Are they… like…"" She leans closer and whispers. ""Horse-Nazis?""

Bart represses a chuckle. ""Er, I just interpreted them as stingy, but I guess that's a possibility as well.""

A few minutes later, they decide to finally call up one of the waiters, since it almost seems as if they've been intentionally passing them by. Eventually, one of them gets close enough to their table.

""Excuse me?"" Clie asks.

The waiter stops in his tracks, turns around slowly, and stares at them menacingly.

""Er… Could we have the menu, please?""

He steps towards them, every hoof hitting the floor like a cannonball. Clie and Bart look at him, then at each other, and back at him. He freezes mere inches from the table.

""Sorry, bud—we don't serve your kind round here.""

They exchange another look with each other, and nod a moment later. ""Alright. I apologize,"" Bart mutters hastily as they get up and move to another place, quite far away from that scene. The waiter continues to stare at them for another minute, not moving at all, before abruptly returning to his waitering business.

""Good grief,"" says Clie.

""Okay. At least they're not Nazis. Uh, I don't think. Let's try a different place—what's this? *The Customer Is Always Right*—that sounds interesting, maybe they're nice.""

Clie follows him to this odd restaurant, now starting to feel quite hungry herself, but unfortunately it turns out *The Customer Is Always Right* is actually a jewelry shop, and the line is way too long to be worth the wait.

""Oh. Jewelry,"" Bart says dryly. ""You want anything?""

""Nah, I just want food.""

""Okay. Let's ask around."" He walks over to the line and taps on the shoulder of one of the horses. ""Sorry, sir, do you know where we could find a bar?""

The horse turns his head away, seeming rather uncomfortable. ""Argh, Jesus…"" he sighs. ""Look, I can't help you, sir. Sorry.""

""Alright, well, any restaurants you recommend?""

""No, sorry.""

""Any food places in general?""

The horse turns his head slowly towards the two of them, his jaw quivering vaguely, his pupils the size of grapes. ""Sorry, bud—we don't serve your kind round here.""

They flinch away and quickly distance themselves from the line. The horse turns his head forward, and his expression returns to normal.

""Occult,"" they both say in unison, except Bart actually says ""A cult,"" though neither of them notice the difference.

""These horse people sure are something,"" says Bart, resuming their wandering of the district. ""But as the guy said, don't be discouraged. I'm sure there are some nicer places.""

""It's hard not to be discouraged, though,"" says Clie. ""It's very unnerving. Hey, let's try this place.""

They stop at the foot of an establishment boasting in flickering neon letters the name *The Bull Bull*. Bart, realizing the pun, chuckles. ""Do you speak Hebrew?""

""Uh, no.""

""Oh. Never mind.""

They walk through the double doors and into the hubbub of what seems to be a cafeteria. Horses sit around long tables, eating sausages from single-use plates and talking loudly. An odd stench fills the room. The pair exchange yet another uneasy expression, then tentatively begin to wander around the tables.

After passing by a few horses, Bart notices that they're all eating the same dish—a long, worryingly thick sausage, served on a styrofoam plate. Recalling the name of the place, a worrying thought crosses Bart's mind, though he brushes it off at first.

The pair walk up to the counter and watch the canteendress approach them. ""'Ello there. What can I get yous?""

Bart looks up at the menu on the wall. It bears only one, capitalized, threateningly large item:

*BULL PENIS*

""Well, at least we'll be served here,"" Clie whispers.

""Yeah, a serving of that hot *dick*,"" Bart replies. ""Uh… Do you have any drinks?""

""Water,"" says the canteendress. ""And coke, if you're feeling frisky.""

""Think we'll just have two cokes then.""

""That'll be $3."" Bart pulls out a three-dollar bill and places it on the counter. The canteendress grabs two styrofoam cups from the shelf and begins filling them up. As the coke runs from the faucet and into the cup, the head stacks up rather quickly, and soon most of the contents of the cup are just bubbly foam.

Irked by this, Bart taps her on the shoulder. ""Uh, you're supposed to tilt the cup. To avoid the foam.""

The canteendress smiles and tilts the cup. ""You're an ex-bartender, eh?""

""Yep. Hoping to get back into the business again.""

""Hmh. I wouldn't count on that.""

Bart raises an eyebrow. ""Why?""

""When are yous from? Thirty eternities ago? Fourty?""

""Er, no. Two.""

""Just two? How come you haven't heard?""

""Heard what?""

""Bars are outlawed. They been outlawed for over twenty eternities.""

""What?"" Bart looks at Clie. Her face, too, is full of disbelief. ""Why?""

""Alcohol's too dangerous, what with time being so easily skipped now. He said it was for the best.""

""He? Who is he?""

""The only one what still has any legal power."" The canteendress's face turns grim. ""Xakh'ath'akh'arus.""

""Xakh'ath'akh'arus?"" He looks at Clie again. ""Xakh'ath'akh'arus… why does that name sound so familiar?""

""We saw it in the Latin town, remember? Two eternities ago.""

""Yeah, but… it feels more… more than that. Like I'd heard it in my past life, before I forgot everything.""

The canteendress hands them the two coke-filled cups. ""People hear his name all the time. He's like the ruler of the world—least, that's the character he plays. He don't really do that much in reality.""

""Why doesn't anyone oppose him, then?"" asks Clie as she takes her cup. ""Surely people still miss bars.""

""I dunno, ma'am. Nobody I've heard of wanted to bring back bars that badly.""

""Well, I do!"" Bart throws his cup to the ground, expecting it to smash against the hard floor into a thousand pieces, but because it's made of styrofoam, it just kind of rolls away sadly, spilling all of its contents.

""Er, sir, do you mind cleaning that up?""

But it's too late for niceties. Bart rushes over to the middle of the cafeteria and stands on a table. Clie waits at the counter, watching curiously.

He clears his throat a couple times, and eventually the babel begins to die down, and the horses turn to gaze at him.

""Gentlemen,"" he cries, ""I stand here on this table and my heart weeps. You have been blinded by the acts of a power that convinced you it is unmatched. You stand at its shackles and you resort to living an inferior life—behold! At this very moment, a plate of hot cock of bull sits before each and every one of you! Do you not see? Life can be better! Life can be good! For twenty eternities have you not known the taste of bitter beer, of sweet wine, of harsh whiskey, of… vodka! What kind of dick-gobbling machines do you see in yourselves? You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! Your livers ache for spirits! Your heads buzz with turmoil! How have you forgotten the ways of bartender jokes, of piano men, of the sweet scent of firewater? Gamers, let us rise up! Let us defeat the one who thinks he can control us! Follow me! Let us defeat Xakh'ath'akh'arus!""

Bart breathes in heavily, and looks at the crowd. No one makes a noise. They just stare at him blankly.

A few seconds later, something hits the back of his head. He looks down. It's a bull penis.

Soon after, another bull penis hits his face.

And another one.

And another one. They start to come faster and faster. Soon he is showered in bull penises, thrown from every direction in the cafeteria. He runs to the door, but the bull penis attack is just too vicious. He slips on a bull penis and falls to the ground, and the bull penises just keep coming, covering his whole body. He tries to get up, but he's stuck under a huge pile of bull penis. He tries to breathe, but he is soon completely trapped in a cave of bull penis. Oh, God, he thinks. This is the end. This is how I'm gonna die.

But then, miraculously, Clie pulls him out of the pile and drags him out of the cafeteria, bull penis now being thrown in her direction as well. Once they are out, they run away from the area. They keep running and running and running, until they can't breathe anymore. Then they slow down, and eventually come to a full stop.

Clie looks at Bart as she gasps for air. He's crouching on the ground, struggling in a similar manner. ""Holy shit,"" says Clie.

Bart takes an additional few seconds to catch his breath, then says, ""At least they weren't Nazis.""

Clie laughs. It sure is comforting to have him around. ""Hey, look,"" she says, pointing at the sign above the restaurant at whose feet they stood. ""This is *The Baker's Anvil*. That guy from the town recommended it.""

""Oh, yeah."" He peeks inside. ""Looks closed. No problem, we can just wait till it opens."" Five seconds later, he begins counting down. ""…Five. Two and a half.""

Clie looks up, and her eyes fill with dread. ""Wait, don't!""

""One and a quarter five eighths five sixteenthsfivethirtysecfivesixfvonftw—"" He disappears in a flash of violet light.

Clie sighs. ""Damnit. One. Half, quarter eighthsixteenthirtysixont—"" She disappears as well.

###ONE ETERNITY LATER

The pair materialize on a rundown boat in the middle of an infinitely deep ocean. Bart scouts the area in disbelief, but there's nothing but water everywhere.

""Wha… Where's *The Baker's Anvil*? Where's the horse town?""

Clie sighs, why, again. ""You don't get how this works, do you?""

Bart pauses. ""N-no. No. Not at all.""

""Eternity is not a unit of time. It's a door between one stage of the universe and the next. Eternity is so vastly long that anything can, and will, happen in it. That means things change. Restaurants get demolished. Towns vanish from existence. Planets get flooded with water. A group of aliens is out there reviving the consciousness of a member of some long-extinct species—that's probably what you'll see after you die, by the way.""

""Wait, what?""

""The point is, *The Baker's Anvil* is gone. It's all gone. We're somewhere new.""

Bart looks over the railing, into the vast bareness of the aquatic landscape. A breeze whispers through his silver hair, which Clie observes intently.

""Fuck,"" he says suddenly. ""Of course. I'm an idiot.""

""Wh—Hey, you're not!""

""Yes, I am! I got on a soapbox and rambled about overthrowing the ruler of the world or whoever he is, and I expected them to help me. They're horses, for god's sake! They eat dick for breakfast! And then I waited an eternity and I thought the stupid restaurant would still be around… god damnit.""

Clie goes silent. It seems Bart has hit a low point, at least in his eyes. In her eyes, it would seem that he's just not in a good state of mind, and perhaps should take a breather. ""For what it's worth, I liked your speech.""

He remains silent for a few moments, then says, ""Thanks.""

They stand there for some time, gazing at the distant horizon, the scent of fresh saltwater filling the air, the sound of seagulls echoing across the ship. It's nice here. After the chaotic horse town, the profound blue feels comforting. No Horse-Nazis, no bull penis, nothing at all. Just Clie and Bart on a ship, in the vast emptiness. And it is good.

&nbsp;

Everything will begin…

###∞ ETERNITIES AGO

When I say everything, I mean *everything*. It'll all start on that day.

Back then, one would dub this day the twentieth of April, sixty-nine thousand and sixty-nine, or 4/20/6969. To some this date would've seemed humorous, perhaps funny. And, well, it is a little. But it wasn't funny to one person in particular. That person was Adolf J. Hitler. 5000 years earlier, in his Führerbunker, he headed into his study with his wife at his side, his heart pounding restlessly. He knew it was the end. That's what he told everyone. Except… the end of what? He intentionally left that detail vague.

The date was the 20th of April, 1969. That's the date when Hitler disappeared. Not one day earlier or later. I think.

But of course, Hitler, as always, had one last Karte up his Ärmel, as they say. He had dabbled in the dark arts some time earlier in the year, and found a spell that he knew early on would come in handy, and this… this was the time to use it. 5000 years of slumber in the astral plane, before he will abruptly return to his old reality, reborn into a new state of existence. He would hold power greater than that any mortal being had ever witnessed before!

The year will be AD 6969.

AD, meaning ""Anno Domini"" (Latin for ""in the year of the Lord""), is of course the opposite of BC, or ""Before Christ."" A common misconception is that, like BC, AD comes after the year number, but it should actually come *before* it. Just a bit of trivia.

Anyway, the year'll be 6969 AD, 5000 years after Hitler's vanishing. It's hard to say precisely what state the Earth was in. It's all a blur to me. But not long after the spell had finally worked its way into Hitler's heart, we land in the beginning, and in the end. When all that will happen is happening, but all that happens comes later. It will be time itself.

It was most unfortunate that Hitler did not manage to fall asleep in the astral plane. As the curse coursed through his veins, he coarsely cursed, yet he never dreamt. For 5000 years he had nought to do but wait for the time to come, and after a mere 200 years it was starting to piss him off.

Figuring the only solution to this rage was to take revenge on time itself, the only barrier between his old life and his newer, he vowed to destroy time as soon as he'd acquired the power to do so. And that's exactly what he'll do. The year'll be A 6969 D. The date will be 4/20 (fuckin americans). The time will be 13:37. This will all happen. It is the only thing that ""will"" ever happen, because it'll all happen once and once only. For one Planck time, everything was together, living in harmony, singing the last song of time, before it'll all break apart.

And then it'll happen.

The next Planck time, everything will freeze. A new face will emerge, and it'll stare at every thing that exists, ever existed, and ever will exist, right in the eyes. That'll include you, at this very moment, as you read through the lines of this anti-anti-joke.

The next Planck time, the face becomes real. It is that of the darkmage Xakh'ath'akh'arus, and as his mighty body rises from the mountain it once rested on, and his eyes blink open revealing two glowing white sockets, a shudder creeps through the core of the Earth itself. Without time to define velocity, and indeed velocity to define space, the universe is plunged into a state of nothingness, and for the first time in many millions of years, no one has the time to care. Literally. Xakh'ath'akh'arus soon realizes this problem, and so he creates a new temporal system, one so vaguely defined as to be skippable at will. No longer will eternity be a block that you cannot pass through—for now, you can wait an eternity using a supertask!

Consider this: Do you want to wait one eternity in 2 minutes? Simple! Wait 1 second in 1 minute, then wait another second in 30 seconds, then another second in 15 seconds, and another one in 7.5, and another one in 3.75, and so on, always waiting for half the time left. Although there is always another second left to wait in eternity, you can always cut the remaining wait time in half, and so, when 2 minutes have passed, you will indeed have waited infinitely many seconds—one eternity in just 2 minutes. How about that?

And what about old time, you say? Old time can stay behind us. The past shall stay where it is; the future shall simply be the one Planck time in which Xakh'ath'akh'arus was born; and the present shall be allocated for everything that exists after the future, in the new temporal system. Perfectly balanced, blah blah blah.

It is now that our story begins.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Just kidding. Fast forward to

###FIFTY-FOUR ETERNITIES LATER

Society is still trying, and failing, to cope with this newfound reality. Bars are a thing of the past—the only thing left are alcohol-free restaurants. You see, being intoxicated within this temporal system enables one to accidentally wait several eternities into the future, thereby missing out on an entire life without wanting to and thus possibly losing family and relatives. As such, it is agreed upon the remainder of surviving civilization to share one universal law: NO BARS. To avoid ambiguity, prison bars are also outlawed, as well as sick rap bars and chocolate bars. Prisons are to use bullet-proof glass instead, raps must not consist of more than one line, and chocolate is banned. This last decision was the most controversial of them all because it was put forward by a black guy.

Suddenly, two people, a silver-haired man and a brunette-haired woman, materialize out of thin air on a roof in a graffiti-laden street, both leaning forward rather uncomfortably, their lips touching. Not long after, they both open their eyes, and quickly flinch away from each other.

""Who the hell are you?"" asks the woman.

""W-what… who the hell are *you*?!"" the man retaliates.

""I'm… I… I don't know, actually.""

""Wait. Me neither. Sorry for shouting at you.""

""It's okay. Don't stress about it.""

The man inspects their surroundings. Dull, grey buildings cover the landscape as far as the eye can see. Not a single skyscraper impedes the view. ""Where are we?"" he asks.

The woman looks down below the roof. A good five yards above ground level, for sure. She is not as athletic as she used to be. Wait— ""Wait. I think I'm remembering who I am,"" she says.

""You are?"" asks the man.

""Yeah, yeah. It's coming back. But it's slow. I think I'm a… a vegetarian?""

""Oh. Cool."" The man, still not recalling his identity, envies her speedy recollection. ""Do you hear that?""

""The voice that said that you envy my speedy recollection?"" Whoops.

""What? No, those Latin shouts. At least I think it's Latin."" He's right. Those are Latin shouts. And they're getting louder. Realizing what is to come, he grabs the woman's hand. ""Come with me!""

""What? Where—""

The roof hatch suddenly bursts open, and a short surly-looking nun emerges with a shotgun in her arms.

""Come on, come on!"" the man yells, running across the roof tiles as gunshots boom behind them.

""SPERO HOC SONAT FORMIDULOSUS, TRUX N-WORDS!""

The woman screeches as he jumps off the roof and onto another, bolting with her hand and ducking behind a solar water heater.

""NUNC EGO NON REPREHENDO, SI RECTE DE FIDELI TRANSLATIONE CONSTET NAM SI PATI LASSUS SUM!"" the nun shouts in what definitely sounds like Latin.

""Jesus Christ,"" the man yell-whispers, breathing heavily. ""Are you okay?""

The woman's eyes are wide open with fear, and yet, thrill. ""Wow. That was fun.""

""It… was?"" he breathes. ""Huh. Yeah. It *was* fun."" A smile climbs onto his lips. ""Wanna do it again?""

The woman returns a hearty grin. ""Hell yeah.""

They jump again onto an adjacent roof, and for the few moments her feet hover above the ground, the woman feels her younger days coming back. What is her name? ""What's yours?"" she asks the man after their feet hit the concrete.

""Huh?""

""Your name.""

""Oh. Uh, I still haven't gotten there."" They jump to another roof. ""I'm just starting to remember my profession. I think I was… like a bartender or something? Or a waiter?"" Another roof. ""No, definitely a bartender. I worked behind a counter."" Another jump. ""What about you?""

""I was a mathematician, I think. And a highschool teacher. I taught English. Whoop!"" She makes that sound after every leap. ""I used to go to the gym on the weekends, but I stopped a couple years in. Teaching is exercise in and of itself. Whoop!""

The man laughs. ""Why are you making that noise?""

""It's fun! Whoop! Wait, wait, I think I'm remembering my name…""

They stop in their tracks. The building they are standing on is only a few feet tall. The man climbs down to the ground and helps the woman on the way down.

""Thanks,"" she says.

""You're welcome. Are you remembering your name?""

""No, it just fleeted away. I think it was Chloe or something.""

""Then I'll call you Chloe for now.""

Chloe for now nods in approval, and scans the street. On the wall opposite them a graffito boasts the words ""CONTUMELIIS AFFICIUNT"" followed by a series of seemingly unrelated letters and apostrophes.

""Hey, uh, what is… Zack-ath-ac-arus? Zackathacarus? Ksacathacarus?""

""Hmm,"" muses the man. ""That name sounds familiar.""

""Is it your name?""

""Yeesh, I hope not. I don't think it is though. Do I look like a Zack?""

""You're too old to be a Zack."" She giggles.

""Yeah, that's… thanks."" The old man's decrepit belly rumbles. ""Man, I'm starved. Wanna go get something to eat?""

""Sure.""

The pair begin searching for a restaurant around the area. A restaurant is a lot like one's soul—if you give it money, it feeds you. Or, uh, if it gets no money, it'll either disappear or relocate, but you'll only know which once it's already happened. I don't know. A restaurant is similar to a soul in lots of ways. You could even say that what these two are doing right now is… **soul-searching**.

The walls of this seemingly abandoned street are covered in graffiti, with the threatening capitalized message reappearing many times in different styles, colors and fonts. *CONTUMELIIS AFFICIUNT XAKH'ATH'AKH'ARUS*. Sometimes there is only one I in the first word; sometimes the apostrophes are missing from the third; but the same tone of urgency and hatred is shared among them all.

""Say,"" says Chloe (for now), ""where do you think all the—where are you?"" She looks around the place, but the man seems to have vanished without a trace. Perhaps he was never there at all, and was simply a figment of her lonely imagination. ""Sigh,"" she says, leaning back on a wall of text. ""One day…"" She doesn't feel that hungry anymore. In fact she was never hungry—she just didn't want that strange man to leave her. But now he has, and she's left with nothing to do and nowhere to go. So what should she do?

Well, as the great Empedocles once said, ""When there is nothing left to do, wait."" So she makes herself comfortable in the corner of the alley and sets to work. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi, four Mississippi, five Mississippi, six Mississippi, seven Mississippi, eight Mississippi, nine Mississippi, ten Mississippi, eleven Mississippi, twelve Mississippi, thirteen Mississippi, fourteen Mississippi, fifteen Mississippi, sixteen Mississippi, seventeen Mississippi, eighteen Mississippi, nineteen Mississippi, twenty Mississippi, twenty-one Mississippi, twenty-two Mississippi, twenty-three Mississippi, twenty-four Mississippi, twenty-five Mississippi, twenty-six Mississippi, twenty-seven Mississippi, twenty-eight Mississippi, twenty-nine Mississippi, thirty Mississippi, thirty-one Mississippi, thirty-two Mississippi, thirty-three Mississippi, thirty-four Mississippi, thirty-five Mississippi, thirty-six Mississippi, thirty-seven Mississippi, thirty-eight Mississippi, thirty-nine Mississippi, forty Mississippi, forty-one Mississippi, forty-two Mississippi, forty-three Mississippi, forty-four Mississippi, forty-five Mississippi, forty-six Mississippi, forty-seven Mississippi, forty-eight Mississippi, forty-nine Mississippi, fifty Mississippi, fifty-one Mississippi, fifty-two Mississippi, fifty-three Mississippi, fifty-four Mississippi, fifty-five Mississippi, fifty-six Mississippi, fifty-seven Mississippi—

Suddenly, she is struck with a brilliant idea. Instead of counting one Mississippi at a regular interval, in this case once per second or so, she instead can count at an accelerating rate, such that the pause between each Mississippi is halved in time after every Mississippi. If she began with one Mississippi in one minute, she would then count the next one in half a minute, and the next in a quarter of a minute, the next in an eighth of a minute, then a sixteenth, a thirty-second, a sixty-fourth, a hundred-and-twenty-eighth, a two-hundred-and-fifty-sixth, a five-hundred-and-twelfth, a thousand-and-twenty-fourth, a two-thousand-and-forty-eighth, a four-thousand-and-ninety-sixth, an eight-thousand-one-hundred-and-ninety-second, a sixteen-thousand-three-hundred-and-eighty-fourth, and so on! Since the sum of all non-positive powers of 2 is, indeed, 2, to her it would seem as if no more than 2 minutes had passed, but to the outside world…?

Excited by this notion, Chloe wastes no time and picks up an outrageously convenient stopwatch from the dirty cement. Surprisingly, and again, conveniently, it still works.

""Mississippi.""

She starts a timer and sits right back down, her face staring inches from the screen. As the seconds begin to pile up, a thought occurs to her—what if instead of saying the word ""Mississippi"" after every count, she instead would alternate between ""Mississippi"" and ""Elephant""? If she does, the question arises—what would she say on the last count? Of course, since she would do this infinitely many times, there isn't really a ""final"" count—and yet, there is a very specifically defined point at which she literally stops counting, since at said point she would have counted infinitely many times. It makes no sense that her last count would be a Mississippi, since every Mississippi is followed by an Elephant, and neither does it make any sense that the last count would be an Elephant, because every Elephant is followed by a Mississippi.

1 minute. ""Elephant."" It seems there is only one way to find out, she thinks, delightfully thrilled.

Another thought occurs to her. After a good number of counts, would she still be able to keep up with the timer? Mississippi and Elephant are long words—both 3.5 syllables long. The average speaking speed is around 4 to 5 syllables a second, meaning in roughly five counts, she would have to significantly up her talking speed. The world record for the fastest talking speed, in your time, was 15 syllables per second, at least on average.

30 seconds. ""Mississippi.""

It is most fortunate, then, that she suddenly remembers it was her who broke the world record, a long, long time ago, when she accidentally uttered the word ""a"" in infinitesimal time during a lecture. A record-obsessed audio engineer had attended that lecture, recorded her voice, and after years of rigorous analysis, confirmed that she had indeed spoken at a speed of ∞ syllables per second.

15 seconds. ""Elephant.""

So it is indeed possible, she realizes, but she has only ever done this once in her lifetime. Now, she shall have to do it infinitely many times. Infinity times infinitesimal time equals two minutes.

7.5 seconds. ""Mississippi.""

Of course, back in old time, there was already a shortest possible unit of time—the Planck time, which is unfortunately only finitely short. Still, it's quite remarkable just how short it is. It's a bit difficult to visualize its incredible briefness, but here's an attempt:

3.75 seconds. ""Elephant.""

Let's say we count one second, and in each Planck time during that second we place a single grain of sand on the ground.

1.875 seconds. ""Mississippi.""

By the time we finish counting that one second, we'll have a whole lot of sand at our hands. How much, do you reckon? Enough to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool? Perhaps even the Grand Canyon? The entire state of New Mexico?

0.9375 seconds. ""Elephant.""

Actually, it turns out we would have enough sand to make a true-scale sand replica of our Sun… 1,600 times.

0.46875 seconds. ""Mississippi.""

We would still have some sand left over, enough to make 45 trillion replicas of all the planets in the solar system…

0.234375 seconds. ""Elephant.""

…and then, if you're feeling patriotic, 7 million sand-made copies of both the Earth and the Moon, and finally after that…

0.1171875 seconds. ""Mississippi.""

…well, you would still have a shit load of sand, more than you could possibly imagine. I just ran out of analogies.

0.05859375 seconds. ""Elephant.""

I think my point was that there's a lot of sand in the world and not enough people to mold it.

0.029296875 seconds. ""Mississippi.""

If we all molded sand every day of the week, imagine how great that would be.

0.0146484375 seconds. ""Elephant.""

We could make a new species, made entirely of sand, and have it succeed us humans when we succumb to Mother Earth's kiss of extinction.

0.00732421875 seconds. ""Mississippi.""

I'm sure the sand people would be fine.

0.003662109375 seconds. ""Elephant.""

Anyway, these Mississippi's and Elephant's are getting quite short, aren't they?

0.0018310546875 seconds. ""Mississippi.""

I think you get the point. Let's skip forward.

###ONE ETERNITY LATER

0 seconds. ""Maleficent.""

Chloe opens her eyes slowly. She's in a different place now. The graffiti is gone. In fact, the whole weird grey Latin town is gone. She is now in a silent, barren desert, not a single indication of any kind of life as far as the eye can see. Just dunes. Horrible, unemotional, unresponsive dunes. Everywhere.

""Oh,"" she says quietly. ""Oh, no. No, no, no, this can't be! Did I just…"" She searches for something to kick at, but the ground is nothing more than sand. So she kicks the sand. ""Fuck! I'm a fucking idiot. God fucking damnit."" She sighs and sits down on the sand. The watch is still there—it reads 2:34. She stops the timer and flings it away from her.

""Ow!"" She turns around. From below the dune, that strange man she saw in the grey town emerges, holding the stopwatch in his one hand and rubbing his face with the other. ""We should keep this, you know. It might come in handy.""

Her eyes light up, and the next moment she bolts at him and wraps her arms around him. ""Oh my god, I thought I'd lost you forever!""

He smiles and returns a hug. ""No. I'm starting to get this place. People don't disappear here—they just live in different times.""

""What do you mean?""

""How did you get here? Did you do the halving-time trick?""

""Yeah. How did you know?""

""I don't think there's any other way to skip eternities other than that.""

""No, I mean… how did you know it would work? The supertask? You didn't say you're a mathematician, or a philosopher.""

""Well, no, but being a bartender means you hear a few nerdy jokes here and there. I try to learn what I can. There's this one joke—come on, let's go.""

""What? Where? There's nothing but sand in this whole place.""

""Nah, I was in a western town just some time ago. I'm sure we'll find it in a sec.""

She scouts the area again. Not a single man-made or animal-made building anywhere, at least as far as she can see.

""C'mon!"" The man begins walking, and Chloe comes to his side.

""How long have you been in this place?""

""Uh, a few weeks, I'd say? It's hard to keep time. These stopwatches aren't a dime a dozen."" He drops the timepiece into his pocket and zips it up.

""And you waited… in this exact spot?""

""Nah, I went to get some drinks. Here."" He hands her a bottle of water. It's warm. ""The folks at that place were real nice. Hope we can find them again.""

Chloe takes a sip, but then she realizes she's not thirsty yet. ""Why did you come back, then? Why didn't you stay there?""

""Well, I figured you'd pop up eventually. You seemed smart, and, uh, I guess I didn't really want to lose you.""

She pauses and looks at him. He returns a modest smile.

""Thanks,"" she says quietly.

""No problemo.""

The pair stroll for some time, and although Chloe doubts he really knows where he's going, she begins to feel quite comfortable at his side. ""Do you remember your name now?"" she eventually asks.

""Oh, yeah. I forgot to mention it. It's Bart Ender.""

She laughs. ""Sure it is.""

""God, I wish. That'd be awesome. Nah, my actual name is Brian van der Ende.""

""Cute. Are you Dutch?""

""I guess so. I don't remember any of my childhood. All I remember from my past life is that I was a bartender. I guess that was more important to me than anything else. What about you?""

""Oh, I haven't had that much time to recollect, but… I think my name is Clie. But I don't remember much else.""

""Okay. Nice to meet you, Clie."" He holds out his hand.

""Nice to meet you too,"" she says and shakes his hand, ""Brian.""

""Please. Just Bart.""

""Bart.""

He smiles in approval and takes a scan around the area. ""Okay, we are definitely lost. Darn.""

Clie sighs nihilistic-like, aye. ""What are we gonna do?""

""Well,"" he says and sits on the ground, ""as the famous Aristotle once said, 'When you're out of ideas, wait.'""

She sits on the ground beside him. ""Did he actually say that?""

""What? 'Course not, silly. It was in Greek."" He pulls out the stopwatch. ""How long do you wait for the first one?""

""Just a minute.""

""A minute? Why not, like, 10 seconds?""

""I guess that works too.""

He turns on the stopwatch and watches the watch wash away the first second, the second second, and so on.

20 seconds later, they're gone.

That was quick.

"""all good things must come to an end""","If this statement is not taken to be vacuous, one must assume there is at least one thing, i.e. one atom which is good. Thus that atom will come to an end.
On the other hand, according to a theory of Feynman, there is only one electron (really, Google it). Since an atom consists of at least one electron, that means that after some time that electron will come to an end. So after some time there will be no electrons, as that electron is the only one in the universe.
But all of our electricity is based on electrons, so that means at some point we will no longer have any electricity, and therefore no reddit. So anything we ever write here is meaningless in the long run.
Of course if we think reddit is a good thing we could have just deduced this directly from the proverb without appealing to this slightly more involved argument.

A bag of depends walks into a bar,"A bag of depends walks into a bar smelling like absolute shit.   The bar tender looks at it and asks, ""Why the long horse"".  The bag of diapers orders a drink and says, ""How much are your afternoon drink specials"".  The bartender looks at the menu and says, ""Depends"". 

And the diapers say, ""What?  I just ordered a drink"".  '

Then the bartender got mad and he said to the bag of diapers, ""You're full of shit"".   

About this time the bag of depends has to scoot over because a horse walked in and sat at the bar.

The horse had  a club soda and scotch and it came to $3.14.  He ordered Pi too but the bartender said they didn't serve food.

So the horse looks at the bag of depends and says, ""Baby I could fill you up"" and the diapers gave a little giggle.   You know how they tend to laugh to themselves.

About this time a ham sandwich walked in, sat next to the horse, ordered a drink and the bartender looked at him and said, ""Look you son of a bitch I already told everybody we don't serve food here"".",3
