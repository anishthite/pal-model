[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),Ingram was +16. We were winning with him on the floor. We were losing with Lonzo on the floor. Luke Walton is a dumbass. I guess featuring Lonzo is more important than getting a win.
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"Nah one game doesn't mean shit "
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"But the haters get to talk trading him after 2 games right? "
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),I'll gladly take L's like this if they play with heart and keep it close. The first half of the game was bloody atrocious

[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),He always starts out that way.  I saw a couple of times he hesitated and allowed the defender to close in on him.  Really limited him as an option.  We could have used him in crunch time

[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"Was fun while it lasted. They need to learn how to close. Teams too young still, they don't have the killer instinct yet. They press to hard and tighten up. They almost blew it against the suns too."

[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),Exactly. Clarkson after the timeout was stumbling and almost lost the ball. It's not on Lonzo. The comeback was crazy but it's not sustainable
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),Might as well try him and see how he does. It’s early season and Luke’s experimenting. He’ll never know what Lonzo can do if you don’t apply pressure
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),He wasn't doing that either.  He was passive midseason Ingram again
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),should not have brought lonzo back in and displaced clarkson as our point guard

[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),lol Lonzo -21 and shooting 3s over Davis and slowed the pace down which ruined the run they were having.... nah not Lonzo..... hahahaha
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"&gt; Nah man. No one would have blamed him for not bringing back guys that got us into that 20 point deficit in the first place and leaving in a squad w momentum.

"
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"The Suns are probably the worst team in the league. 

We didn't play good against the Pelicans btw. Defense is non existent. We went on one good run and that was it."
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),Pretty much made all the difference you spanner
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),Randle set a few good hard screens too

[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"Exactly. All these people are so quick to throw blame. Nelson and Moore, scrubs, made 2 miracle 3 pt shots with hands in their faces. Just not Lakers night is all."

[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"Kuzma played 30 minutes (24 last game I believe) and Clarkson played 24 (around the same last game, I think)"

[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),I mean I love Lonzo too but it's pretty safe to say someone didn't play well when he's -24 in 36 mins in a game we lost by 7
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"Damn ya throwing out stats I ain’t never heard of. Fuck I’m getting old. "
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"He held up the whole team for 60% of the game with 0 rest. These fans sometimes, smh ... "

[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"Yeah I think lukes rotations are just not that great and it comes down to experience. Most coaches know to ride the hot hand in a situation like that "
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),Because he was playing way too many minutes for a teenager. Luke needs to rest his players.
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),You'd be surprised how often that would happen last season but people would complain that D'Lo didn't get to finish the game still. He will never please everyone
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"You don't use timeouts in that situation to give players more energy, when it's your last one.

[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),... what?
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),He was consistent all preseason too. The hate Clarkson has gotten here as of recent has been unwarranted
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),No. This experiment will just lead to a Top 5 pick for the Celtics. We were winning the game but Luke just had to roleplay as a scientist.
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"Only criticism I’d give him tonight is his shot was off, but shit happens it’s his third nba game lol "
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"Any word on a kuzma injury? 

He was holding his hand/wrist after that last shot of the game. He seemed ok though. Gave some
High fives and didn't look concerned "
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),His last fw mins were ok playing wise but he should of been rallying the troops. Instead Bogut had to!
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"Holy shit this is depressing to read. 

Edit: are we really this terrible of a team? "
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),JC was probably so exhausted at that point.  He was maintaining that ridiculous pace for a while
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"Lol @ people blaming Lonzo for the loss. If it weren't for him basically generating all the offense in the first 2.5 quarters, they would've been down by 50. "
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),Well show me a 20 year old that isnt inconsistent. I'll wait....
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),Lol dude it's ok to admit Lonzo had an objectively bad game. He's a rookie it's to be expected
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),Everyone was -12 until we went on the run. Lonzo is our best player.
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),Yeah KCP missed a gimme midrange jumper that could've brought us back into the game and given us more confidence. oh well.
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),Lots of moments with Kuz talking to Clarkson.  I wonder what that was about?
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"tbh i dont think Walton has ever had good rotations. Agree though if that shot hit he is hero but misses it just looks dumb already being 0/4 and davis in your face.
"
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"Ur right this sub gets toxic haha. But what was your actual opinion. Squad should have stayed or that lineup change? "
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"He didn't shoot any 3s over Davis though. He shot a 3 with 3 seconds left on the clock over Nelson. That's a good shot to take. 

"
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"Lol He didn't have an ""objectively bad game"". He had 13 assists and led our team in rebounds. He wasn't perfect, that's fine."
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"I put this loss on Luke as well. Poor decision making down the stretch, no set plays, no subs, terrible usage of our last timeout"
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"I trust Luke. I wanted Lonzo to come in and finish the game off, I think he's our best playmaker. I wouldn't have complained either way though."
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"When did he shoot a 3 with Davis in his face? "
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"Ingram is really good today. Hell, Even defended AD with his heart. Part of the reason we got that almost come back run. I guess Luke should have kept him in the game after the 5th foul."
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"I’m calling you young because you sound young and ignorant; not worth replying further "
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"Great stuff from our team.

[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"People are quick to forget what happened early on in the game, we were absolute ass. 

He's a rookie, he'll have games like this. He needs to live and learn from these games."
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"Multiple posts and comments about Luke being at fault for the lineup change...Lonzo finished our last game well, it would make sense that he had the opportunity to close this one."
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"Even though we lost, it was still a good game. Crazy comeback until the last couple minutes "
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),People really blaming Lonzo when Mr. Untouchable was taking a nap in the lockerroom the whole game
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),yea exactly. we need our fair share of vet stars to come in and ground the team to avoid those types of mistakes. eyes on PG + boogie to drop everything and move to LA
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),Leadership?
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),Also... There was 3 second left on the clock when he took it. I think he knew he wasn't hot. It's not like he sprinted up and took a 3
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),dude we don't have our pick. the only people happy with this L are Celtics and Sixers fans.
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"... he also shot 23%, had 5 TO and the worst +/- on the team. He didn't play well and THAT'S OK HES A ROOKIE IT HAPPENS. Let it go brah"

[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"YES, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.


Some guys are trying to put it on Lonzo when he's not at fault."
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),Lonzo slowing the pace??? Are you for real lol
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),Playing with Hart and Heart are synonymous to be honest. That kid deserves much more playing time. He can shoot and defend very well
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"13 assist &gt; 5 TO is a pretty good ratio.

His shot wasn't falling, but he played well."
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"I blame him for not making a substitution earlier in the 1st when starters came out like trash "
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),I prob cant but pretty much any player thats deem un-trade-able are pretty consistent.
[Box Score](http://scores.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400974791),"And we had some open shots that missed. I felt okay about the loss. If we fight like that night in and night out, one or two big stars could see themselves changing those L's to W's."
