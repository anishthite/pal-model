Does Clinton accept now or wait until tomorrow?,"...and they shouldn't. "
"Who are the potential Labour picks? Can Labour stop the Brexit with the right leader? ","Unfortunately, yes. But the people have spoken. Hopefully a new Left politic can emerge and steer us through this time. I'm deeply concerned with the alternative of ultra-right nationalism. "
Who do you think will take his position? Do you think that this will cause further instability in the economy?,"I heard this was going to happen but I didn't expect this to actually happen. As an American I have to ask, who replaces him?"
"I mean, why is this trend happening now rather than, say, the early 2000s? What makes it appealing to some people?

They're probably referring to gun control."
"Just curious. Also, do his views align more with Clinton or Trump?","Maybe I'm just not seeing it, but I think the potential for Johnson (especially him at 10%+ in polls) is really overblown. I'd be surprised if he even got over 5% in November."
Who do you think will take his position? Do you think that this will cause further instability in the economy?,British Isles isn't a continent

"I'm not an American so I can't exactly 'feel' the mood regarding today's terrible events, but will what happened today cause more people to turn to Trump?

I heard Harry Reid is promoting Warren for Hillary's VP. Will her far left positions turn off moderates or anti-trump conservatives?,Kaine looks like the best bet. Smart and solid. This election won't be about the vice presidents.
Could Clinton use this to shift the focus towards the harmful effects of homophobia? How could Trump respond?,"Really only true of Abrahamic faiths.  Buddhism, Confucianism, Hinduism and Sikhism do not demonize and shame LGBT people."
Does Clinton accept now or wait until tomorrow?,If that's where you want to hang your hat be my guest but nothing so far indicates any type of criminal charges will be pursued.
I haven't seen any polls or anything. But he's starting to get national attention (CNN) and being funded by Sanders supporters. Does he have a realistic chance or not?,"I know of a lot of people, myself included, who are not sanders supporters who do not want her as DNC chair. I don't want her to lose her seat, just not be chair. "
Does Clinton accept now or wait until tomorrow?,"I'm still going out tomorrow in California and do my duty by voting.

For John Kasich.

Or Ben Carson for giggles. Haven't decided."
"Who are the potential Labour picks? Can Labour stop the Brexit with the right leader? ","200,000 Labour members chose him.

The Labour MPs who have called on him to resign represent far, far more Labour voters."
How does this change the email situation Clinton has on her hands?  Is it still a security review?,"It what way? And how do you make that observation from an improperly filed FOIA request? "
"I mean, why is this trend happening now rather than, say, the early 2000s? What makes it appealing to some people? And will it last, or is it just a fad?","Which is funny because Elon is a libertarian that leans left in the US. "
"If the GOP had to remove Trump as their nominee before or at the convention, how would they do it?","I don't see how that's relevant when ""not Trump"" got even more votes."

Does Clinton accept now or wait until tomorrow?,California voted in February in 2008...
I heard Harry Reid is promoting Warren for Hillary's VP. Will her far left positions turn off moderates or anti-trump conservatives?,Well Obama was also young and inexperienced and he was a smash hit in 2008. Booker also provides alot of benefits for Clinton which i cant see anyone else matching.
Does Clinton accept now or wait until tomorrow?,Perfect response but she'll still get vilified for something that the AP did
"Assuming she cannot appeal to both, which demographic would she have an easier time winning over?","Yes.  And even if it wasn't, foreign policy is only one of many planks."

"Today essentially all basketball fans think of MJ as the greatest to ever play. Before this, who was the GOAT. Was there an overwhelming favorite?","It wasn't a consensus.  Bird was among the candidates, and immediately after he won three MVPs some argued he was the greatest, but it was far from a consensus."
What do you think the c's do tonight? Keep their assets in a potential marginal free agent period? Go after a Noel type player with #3?,Cause Isiah Thomas is 5 foot 9.

where would Harrison Barnes fit into the 2012 Draft if it could be redone now?,"crappy on defense, never in shape, inefficient... not much to like honestly"

Do the points get reset? Will he be suspended again?,100% guarantee it will be brought up on podcasts almost whenever this hypothetical Cavs championship is brought up. Even in 10-20 years. Mainly because Draymond is on track to be a HOF
"Why is this man getting a max again? ","25 points on 21 shots isn't horrible, but he can certainly play better."

What do you guys think of a potential Butler-for-(Ingram) trade? Would Ingram be more valuable than Butler for the Lakers?,"If they're really Laker fans, they'd know that we haven't actually signed any big free agents since Shaq. "
Who would you rather have going forward?,"We haven't seen how he plays against NBA talent while we've seen KAT undoubtedly succeed in his first year against NBA talent. Simmons may pan out to not have MVP talent. "

"I think the answers will be pretty one-sided, but I'm interested to see. Also, you get The Admiral or Timmy D for their entire career. Which do you take?","Jordan and Duncan all day "
"Who has the worst shot selection in the league? I can only watch limited games (cavs and national tv games), so my answer has to be JR Smith of course. ","I feel ya. It becomes more noticeable at the end of games too, when he and Durant try to go Kobe mode to bring their team back."
Anyone have a video of the fan running onto the floor?,He must've really let go of himself since the California primary
This was brought up on The Ringer and it really got me thinking how we've always been buying in on his potential but have yet to really see it pay off. What do y'all think?,"Millsap can score, rebound, pass and defend. Irving can score. Personally, I'm taking the versatile guy."
