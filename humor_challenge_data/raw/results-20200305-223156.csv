"I'm not a Lakers fan, but I just wanted to ask your opinion. Which number do you think best represents Kobe? I.e., if only one could be retired, which one and why?","I should've guessed that answer from your flair. "
Are brainfarts common? 2 days in.,OH YES!!! Some simple things seem like I am relearning them as I got.  Very strange feeling but I vote normal..
"What are some of the problems London has, but the media never addresses?

What do you think deserves more attention?",This is what I mean. London is not too bad. People in Germany smoke far more than people here.
Just drove past this odd billboard in walthamstow. Tried googling it but the website just seems like conspiracy ranting.. Any idea what the what it's about?,hooray for freemen of the land! they make dull court visits interesting!

"So I don't really care for the brightness of my lights, and want to replace the lights only. Any one else go through this, and have suggestions ? 2015 3i touring here

And which movies should have received an opposite rating?,"The fight between Morpheus and Agent Smith is kind of brutal, but its really no worse than Batman vs Superman."
And why?,"Stoner Comedys. I can sometimes enjoy the weirdness and campyness of them. I liked Dude Wheres My Car and Harold and Kumar. But most are just ""weed is funny"" jokes."
"Looking at critical acclaim, it's easily one of Abram's best.  What's with the hate all over the Internet? Are people seeing something professional critics didn't?","Wow. That's a refreshing opinion "
"Disney seems to make some large acquisition every few years, and its coming time for a new one. What could it be?",Paddington showed how it can be done.
Watched Daredevil Season 2 and the ideological differences between Daredevil and Frank Castle were amazing. Are there any movies like that?,*The Sunset Limited* is pretty much exactly that. It's extremely dialogue-based but it's an absolutely riveting film.
"I'm not gonna lie, I say ""You just don't get it, do you?"" too often.",Just a bit outside...
"Such as ""Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?"", ""I'm the king of the world!"" or ""Begone, before somebody drops a house on you, too!""",Never mind. It's Clerks.
"Are there any bits of gold out there I don't know about?

Bonus discussion: What movie or movies had the absolute WORST CGI?","Would have to agree, at the time of its release there were few effects that could compete with the t1000 melting through the steel bars."
"Everywhere on the internet, I have seen a ton of hate for the movie. Where did it all come from? It's not like the X-Men franchise was shite for the last few films.","First Class is the only one of those that comes *close* to Winter Soldier in quality. "
"For me it was ""The invitation"" recently. 
Almost an hour and I dint know shit about where the film was going and what's the fucking plot. 
It was almost frustrating.
What is that film for you??","Fuck, Now I have to watch the entire episode. "
Do campy movies exist anymore? Or has postmodernism killed that genre?,These sound awfully similar to some softcores that 12 year old me would watch on HBO
What are the best examples you can come up with?,"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory

Many Bollywood films where the songs aren't random and have a connection to the plot. 

"
"Have there been any period films (non parody/comedy) which have included modern slangs, phrases, etc by mistake?","I don't know, that one sounds to me like it could have been around then."
"Not necessary the biggest, but which is your favourite? I remember seeing Independance Day for the first time and the way the aliens blew up the Empire State Building was just epic. ","When ""The Big One"" exploded in *Toy Story*. The most epic moment in the entire movie follows immediately after wards."
"Could be because the tech now would make it possible/better looking, or the original was ok, but more could have been done?","I'd like to see some of the Marvel properties from the 90's or early 2000's like Blade or Ghost Rider remade, but this time as part of the MCU."
And which movies should have received an opposite rating?,"I mean, Pirates are pretty rapey and all this Disney stories that take place in medieval times have a bunch of serfs and shit offscreen."
Just a quick question. Is there a certain order you would recommend?,"I started on Rebecca, but it might have been easier for me to get in that way because I'm rather campy and interested in the Fontaine/de Havillands."

Psycho

Sunset Blvd.

In the Heat of the Night

Metropolis

Streetcar Named Desire

Bambi

And which movies should have received an opposite rating?,Minority Report was a pretty hard PG-13.
We all know about Vader being Luke's father. What are some others?,"Yeah it was my fault, but maybe for next time say the title first, was it a good movie tho? Planning to see it. Cheers!"
"Mine's Cool Hand Luke, what's yours?","Such an incredible movie, it's definitely a contender to my in my top 5 of all time."
"For me its 2001 a space oddyssey. Long, slow, and boring for little payoff. No idea why its so highly acclaimed.
you guys?",2001: A Space Odyssey and The Shawshank Redemption
Why is it necessary for a sequels to maintain the same rating? It would be cool to see a series getting more and more mature each movie.,I think the original title works fine here.
"Everywhere on the internet, I have seen a ton of hate for the movie. Where did it all come from? It's not like the X-Men franchise was shite for the last few films.",Munn pulls it off perfectly.
"OL and CB are really the only immediate help we need. And with the money we wont be giving Fitz, we could get the other position we dont draft. What do u guys think?","And as I said in the other thread, Schefter only knows what teams want him to leak. "
