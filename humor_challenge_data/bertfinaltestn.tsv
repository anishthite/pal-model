If the question is whether "black" people (as an abstract generalization) and "Asian" people (as an abstract generalization) are "equal" on the statistically measurable and verifiable average of the quality we call "intelligence," as represented by IQ, the answer is "no." That statement is as indisputable, objective, and detached as any other truth statement. It has no emotional or political content beaides what baggage is brought to it by its speaker or reciever. It just *is*. It's like saying "Fir trees are taller than shrubs." In this case, the characteristic is height. In the case of Asians and blacks, the characteristic is IQ. This measurement is as indisputable and inarguable as the measurement of height with trees.Does it also mean that Asians are generally more *intelligent*? That's a more complex question. But to say that those who would say "yes" that they are racist is indeed wrong and unfair. IQ predicts a whole host of things in life and has been proven through careful and serious research to matter, and to matter *a lot.*.Of course, when we feel offended it is hard to just listen and think. It's actually quite impossible for some people to do this. But we must do this.So the reason it is important to know this is that this is a matter of fact. This is a matter of up and down, right and left, and Sun and Moon. It's something that everyone should be able to say and think about without being accused of criminal or moral character.Yet today our cultural climate has made it so that certain facts "don't exist" - no matter what. And we enforce this on ourselves through a sort of ritual of signaling tolerance to one another. "N-no that's not what I meant! Please, not me! Not me!"As though our lives depended on not offending others. It's like we're in the court of the King begging for our lives. Except now the King is social justice and it's deluded and cruel proponents.I believe that standing up for the facts - as facts - is the fastest way to improve the situation of black people. Anytime a person represses a fact, he or she represses her own existence. It has side effects.I can't tell people how to live with the truth. It wasn't hard for me. Just because whites and Asians are statistically more intelligent doesn't mean anything about individuals. It just means that nobody can call you evil for saying "Africa isn't as good as other places because the people living there are less intelligent genetically."And in saying it, you are saying something true, not evil. And if anyone has a problem with that, it's *their* problem. And they are in the wrong for treating you inhumanly because the true things you are saying they find personally disagreeable.There's a long way to go to let people out of this repressive religious structure. But with a little effort to face reality and work to be tolerant while also being honest we will perfect our understanding of this era.No matter how it makes us "feel."	0.0

So much of the concept behind the Matrix makes more sense when you consider it to be a giant neural network, with each human brain functioning as an independent computer within the shared group. When you hook to the Matrix, you are connecting your computer to the group. When you are killed in the Matrix, it's because your computer's hardware and software was irrevocably damaged by intrusive malware. When you do crazy shit in the Matrix, it's because your hacked software is interacting with the system outside of the protocol, you're effectively accessing at sysadmin level and can rewrite your own permissions. They really jacked it up when they switched that to being about batteries, presumably for the product placement(?), possibly because they thought the concept was too complex for the lowest common denominator. But when you think of each person in the Matrix as being an individual computer in a giant shared network, the things that Neo does both inside *and outside* the Matrix make *so* much more sense.	0.0

Is this the Rinehart method? One billionaire was asked how he made his fortune, the fact being known that he was flat broke when he was young. He told this story: he was once wandering the streets hungry and with only 10 cents in his pockets. Saw someone selling some rather unattractive looking apples for 10 cents a piece. He bought one apple and as he was about to eat it, he got an idea. Polished the apple and as it was now much better presenting, he was able to sell it for 20 cents. Which he then used to buy two apples, which he polished and sold for 40 cents. Which he used to buy four apples, earning 80 cents, buying eight apples... and then his childless uncle died and left him a billion dollars.	1.0

So, I'll start by saying that I think Lauren Southern's take on being an anti-feminist is a bit... underdeveloped. Further, I think she's more feminist critical, like myself, rather than specifically anti-feminist. Its this distinction that I think I've failed to, and others have failed to, specify. I, personally, am not anti-feminist, for example, but I am feminist critical - specifically to certain forms of feminism, and only after that am I in any way anti-feminist to particularly specific forms of feminism.That said, I think the criticism of LS's anti-feminism is poorly defined on both sides. Her arguments aren't anti-feminist so much as feminist critical, in my opinion.---The author's given list of women's problems is a bit... weak, or rather, the issues listed aren't as pronounced and pervasive as they once were. For example, women's right to abortion or birth control is certainly an issue worth addressing, but its also largely religiously opposed, not gender-opposed. Another example might be the 'devaluation of women's labor', which is hardly true in the literal sense, but rather I think they're referring to pay inequality, which certainly an issue worthy of concern, the arguments against pay inequality largely ignore the counter-arguments of personal choice, and so on, thus shifting the issue into one of gender roles. To put it simply, the issues listed are certainly complicated, but comparatively minor to issues that women have historically faced, and that non-western women currently face, not to mention are mostly in a state of either being addressed, or in a state of being relatively solved. Pay inequality, to pull my example again, is certainly worth concern, but its just not the massive issue that its made out to be.&gt;Now, that being said, I actually think that feminists do focus quite a lot on issues impacting men. As I describe in #2 below, the gender regimes that impact women also impact men, and feminists offers many tools to challenge them alongside one another.My criticism of this largely comes from the goal being the attack of these paradigms in how they affect women, while getting an added benefit of helping men too in the process. That is to say, that they're not really trying to help men, specifically, within this attack of the current paradigm, but get to claim that they're helping both sides.Now, I don't think the feminists in this don't care about men, or that they aren't happy that they're able to help men too, simply that their goal appears to be helping women, with a secondary byproduct of that being that they help men too. So when someone says 'feminism helps men too' with this sort of context, they're not being entirely honest about who it is really helping. In a hypothetical, overly exaggerated example, lets say a serial killer goes around and ends up killing people with Ebola. Well, his goal was killing people, but he gets the added benefit of helping other people not get ebola. That isn't to say that he isn't glad to get rid of Ebola [after all, he wants to kill those people himself], but that its more a byproduct of his original goal, not his initial intention. Now, mind you, this may not entirely be fair to individual feminists, as some may want to cause that helping to men, intentionally, I'm just a bit skeptical of how many feminists are looking to cause that byproduct specifically, and not simply as an added benefit to the original goal.---&gt;In particular, feminists demonstrate how norms of femininity and masculinity entrench ideas about appropriate male and appropriate female behavior, which deeply shape the conditions of these male deaths.When I hear this argument, I have, again, a hard time swallowing it, for very similar reasons to the ones above. So, sure, feminism gets to also look at home men are harmed with gender roles. However, I see the issue often being framed through a feminist lens. That's, again, not to say that feminists don't care about male deaths, only that it appears to be framed in a way that's really more concerned with how male deaths, or rather women being put into a position of being protected, harms women, rather than the men specifically dying. So, to me it looks framed in a way that men dying is a byproduct of the system that they're trying to break down, not because men are dying, but because of how it also harms women. The focus isn't on the male deaths, but of the over-protection, and lack of agency, that women receive in the deal. Again, to be fair to feminists, I do believe that they care about the male deaths, I simply see it framed in a female-centric way that largely isn't quite as concerned with men dying so much as women not having agency - which makes sense if feminism is concerned with how problems affect women specifically, rather than the egalitarian viewpoint that is often suggest feminism is about. Although, even then, there's some definite overlap amongst all of this.&gt;She writes, “In this patriarchal logic, the role of the masculine protector puts those protected, paradigmatically women and children, in a subordinate position of dependence and obedience”See, the problem is not framed in how men are dying, but how women are harmed. There's a definite women to not ending up dead, but at a lack of agency. The problem is certainly a valid concern, however, dying seems more immediately important than simply losing agency. So, sure, women end up harmed in such a dynamic, but there's this lack of attention paid to how men, specifically, are the ones physically dying to make that happen. I simply disagree with the framing.&gt;I’ll just add on the note of male combat deaths, though: part of the reason it’s disproportionately men is because sexist policies in the U.S. military have historically barred women soldiers from combat roles.First, I still feel like there's some valid arguments and areas of concern with women in combat roles. Still, the problem is again not framed in how men are ones dying, but how women aren't allowed to go off to die, because of the policies, is the problem. Its putting the situation through a female-lens that largely seems to pass over the men dying in favor of women's choice to end up in a position where they could die. The issue as a whole certainly effects both men and women, but its framed in a way that focuses on what women aren't able to do, not on how men are dying.This particular sort of framing is why I am feminist critical. When you start to frame and put everything through a feminist lens, you're not adequately approaching an issue that has multiple complex issues, and instead end up focusing on just one aspect that is, without question, not as bad as the other part of the problem. You can't have an issue with agency if you're dead.So, again, to throw out an olive branch, I don't think feminists don't care about men dying, I'm just trying to show a clear valid criticism of how the issue is framed in a way that downplays men dying in favor of how women aren't able to have all the agency that they want.---&gt;Coercive Controlling Violence... This type of DV is rooted in patriarchy and misogyny.Or is it simply rooted in controlling people? There seems to be this sort of assertion that being controlling, in this case, also means someone is a misogynist, and that it ties into patriarchy. I have a really hard time ascribing those two terms to this sort of DV. Sure, there's some parallels, but its possible that someone doesn't hate women, but has control issues that causes the behavior.&gt;But when you’re talking about systemic violence, violence rooted in fear and control, and violence that results in serious injury, the vast majority of assailants are men and the vast majority of victims are women.Fear and control aren't specific to men, nor to sexism. Still, men do appear to resort to physical violence more often, rather than more mental and verbal abuses. Then again, physical abuse by men is largely ignored or under-reported based upon concepts of masculinity.---I had/have more to say in response to this article, but my brain is present bus'ed, so I'll have to, hopefully, get back to it later - if I ended up motivated to do so.	0.0

Ugh it would be much more better without brainwashed, but i guess you missed past 24 years when Russia tried hard to follow this possibility of pacifism leading and partnership. As it turned out your economy utopia don't applied to everyone equally.When i started to lurk reddit, i had pretty liberal mood with very favorable views towards US and EU, but what you guys posting there could turn Krishna into the Putin's supporter. I realized that all those sweet words frequently used in speeches about "democracy, equality and freedom" are non-factor in foreign affairs, and your governments actions have nothing common with loudly declared "freedom, democracy, equality and prosperity for everyone".US have many interests in general including the wide range of economical interests and it's pretty natural that they see some actions as potential threat to their position. If prosperity only leads to prosperity there would be no such terms as "economical conflict". And for one second the last economical conflict happened just recently in Ukraine. I can't see how Russia could greatly benefit from relations with EU if Europe considering Russia as a non factor in decisions making in part of Russia's economical space. At first you have to learn what equality, mutual respect and consensus mean in practice and maybe then pacifism could lead us all to a better tomorrow.Instead of blame us, like we have no clue and absolutely zero reasons to be wide-awake i suggest you to read this article [5 Western Media Memes Which Turn Russians Against Us](http://russia-insider.com/en/media-criticism/5-memes-why-russians-hate-western-media/ri9197?utm_source=Russia+Insider+Daily+Headlines&amp;utm_campaign=2317457b4b-Russia_Insider_Daily_Headlines11_21_2014&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_c626db089c-2317457b4b-192063025&amp;ct=t%28Russia_Insider_Daily_Headlines11_21_2014%29) - pretty accurate explanation of how we, Russians, feel about the western attitude towards us.	0.0
i don't want to comment on that "startup" because it seems everything is already said here. about "the government": well, it's a very political problem. you could ask mr. schäuble on why he is so keen on his "schwarze null". or you could read about the [berliner bankenskandal](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berliner_Bankenskandal) on why berlin is so in debt. or read about the special berliner politik in [this great book](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/3426269309?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=od_aui_detailpages00). our former mayor klaus wowereit may be a great party guy but he also executed a heavy "austerity" policy on this city during the last decade. and finally think about the very expensive clusterfuck BER. so, no money no funny.for me, this special mixture of berlins corruption and incompetence plus at least two decades of neo-liberal politics in germany results in many things ;) but also in an understaffed bürgeramt. that's how i like to explain it to myself.	0.0

They turned around to do their duty.In the chaos, Jeor Mormont felt for a moment the same as these untrained men and green boys, just as lost and confused. He shook himself, grabbed a torch from a sconce nearby, and made for the cage. He would be at the top of the wall with his men, on the first line of defense.

I am presently running a Victor/Thor team - both of whom you have.  Note that I have been playing for a while and your mileage may vary, but here's my setup.  It comes in large part thanks to advice and tips I've picked up from this subreddit over the last couple months:I run Victor (presently Level 12) with a couple of Stalwart (white) and six Steady (purple) ISOs.  I have the Lingering E-ISO (counterattacks apply poison) which I picked up during a Daily, and threw an Ionizing A-ISO in his L2.  In combat, I spam L2 until the enemy agent is gone.  After that, I only continue to use L2 if there are tech users.  I'll hit his L6 and mop up with L1 as needed.For Thor (level 14), I use the AoU Blaster alt with a couple Chaotic (white) and six Steady (purple) ISOs.  I use his personal Dynamic E-ISO (found in the Heroic roulette in mission 2.2.3 and farmed with relative ease).  For his A-ISOs I run an Aiming, a Focused, a Manifesting, and a Powerful in his L1, L2, L6, and L9 respectively.I make sure I have the Legion Pulse Rifle equipped for my Agent to exploit Victor's L2 as much as possible.  Other neat gear would include the Bug Zapper (from the present Spec Op M1 boss) if you wanted a protect Agent.  Aside from that, everything else is gravy.  The static damage and tech lockdown handles most teams quite nicely.  If you add the Mandible, Rapier, and Vigilante Mask, you will be a follow-up factory.  You want to get real nasty?  Bring Avengers Thor (70CP for the Blaster, 51 for the Bruiser...probably a little too steep since you're saving for the next Spec Op) and add Coordinated Attack to the mix.  Damn.I'm presently have 50 attacks (48 wins), and am sitting on a 1139 (top 0.89%) rating.EDIT - Grammar.  I have the writing skills of a small monkey.	0.0

Would you mind linking the source of the information about the 148% pay favor for women? I'm curious to see.Second, let's take a moment here to calm ourselves and think ratonally. Let's look at some of the semantics of the video. First off, their discussion, as it pertains to a "wage gap" is covered while the conversation was on all industries, not just fashion. In fact, I didn't really get the feeling that a wage difference in fashion was something any of them meant to say. Second, there was plenty of time spent in the video explaining how men and women should have equal amount of maternity/paternity leave- a big plus for everyone.Thirdly, a lot of the video covered topics such as body type and race acceptance, which are both different topics from the gender "conflict" entirely.While I'm not saying a couple of things in the video aren't  inaccurate, everyone seems to have skipped the video and gone straight to bashing these people for simply identifying as a feminist.	0.0

For those curious. I punched these results into my calculator and...It's not terribly unlikely. You would expect to get this within 7751 rolls total. 3114 rolls each on the contacts and hi-tops brings you to a 50% liklihood of one of the rolls being your desired triple; only 1523 rolls for the uniform.http://i.imgur.com/n89wYBT.pngIt is very likely savescummed (only way you'd get that many rolls), but they'd have to have taken hours to do this. (Even 1000 rolls, if done 10 at a time, would be 100 resets, which would be like 3 minutes each... So, 5 hours for 1000 rolls? Mindlessly tedious, but doable; 40 hours of "gameplay" to get these results.)	0.0

We both dated other people, but when we finally saw each other again, we couldn't deny there were still feelings there and - this is important - we had actually both changed. Our relationship now is like a continuation of before, but much healthier.	0.0

I've been called worse by better people. And the company is mine as much as my dad's because while he started it, I've helped. I've also been the one to grow it much more than he had.

&gt; I mean Kendrick Lamar, Danny Brown, and Olivia Tremor Control? They are all fantastic, but no where near top 100 of all time. Danny Brown I'd agree with, but Kendrick is destined for classic status. Olivia Tremor Control, like The Fiery Furnaces, might not have been massively popular (/are not massively popular) but they are absolute masters of their craft. And in the end that is what dictated a lot of this list, as you can see with the little-to-no bias for "classic" albums.Speaking of which...&gt;If this was made by one person, it would be a ridiculous list because aside from Beach Boys and the Beatles, they pretty much ignored mainstream classic rock. I think this is the first list I've seen with no mention of Zeppelin, Hendrix, Dylan, Michael Jackson, The Who, The Stones, etc.If I'm totally honest, I feel those groups' albums are often praised more for their historical influence/importance than their musicality. &gt;I think the biggest example is Nirvana In Utero winning over Nevermind. I mean, I get why an individual would like that album better, but there's no denying Nevermind as a top 100 album. Pretty sure I knew every song on that album before I became a Nirvana fan. Every one of them had the potential to be a moderately big hit. This is, yet again, prioritization of influence/importance over musicality, it seems.	0.0

Yeah just got back from groceries and in the mean time I realized that a lot of the events in the game substantiate my theories. For example when Wrathion is pissed off about Varian and starts ranting in the legendary cloak questline, he says "Should've taken over the throne room myself like Aunti Onyxia. Get things Done". And who is the one who announces the arrival of the burning legion to Varian in the Stormwind throneroom? Wrathion. I think he's impersonating Khadgar in order to put himself in the same position that Onyxia was in. I think he's going to take the Sythe of Elune to use it in some way to ensure his death. Varian is closely tied to the Worgen through the events of the comic books and I think it would be amazing if Wrathion used the Scythe of Elune to turn Varian into a mindless Worgen/Demon boss that we have to fight.	0.0

I'll Repost this here, let me know if it sounds familiar:Unlike many people on here alcohol has not caused me a great deal of problems, but that does not mean it hasn't taken it's toll on my health, my weight and wallet have suffered, but I don't have a problem. I always use a DD, I've never gotten into a drunken brawl or hit someone while intoxicated. I don't drink hard liquor, just beer and wine every night. But I don't have a problem. I've had a fairly rough go at life, but I've had my lucky breaks too and after a hard day I deserve to get drunk on a work night. But I don't have a problem. All day I'm at work I can't wait to get home and have that first drink, but I don't have a problem. There are two fist holes in the wall, but that was from stress I just happened to be drinking when that happened, but I don't have a problem. I only drink when something good or bad happens, but I don't have a problem. Every 20 something drinks like a fish so I don't have a problem. My withdrawal symptoms are mild, so I don't have a problem... Right? Hello, I'm an alcoholic...	0.0

A few things it could be.- FL ASIO by default applies a limiter to the output signal, rather than clipping it. Select FL ASIO as your driver, then click "Show ASIO Panel", and make sure "Hard clip at 0dB" is ticked. This will truncate the audio stream to clip.- ASIO4ALL bypasses Windows audio, while FL ASIO does not. If you have applied effects or enhancements through Windows audio, these will be present when you're using FL ASIO. Make sure you don't have some weird enhancement on your output.- Possibly a microphone input that's going to speakers and being feedback looped. Check your I/O.There is probably other things as well, but that's what I got off the top of my head. What happens if you switch back to FL ASIO now? :)	0.0

This works in the United States as well.I went to school in New York, my family moved from Massachusetts to California in that time. I vividly remember conversations where I was in a group of people and someone asked "Where are you guys from?"

But if I say "Well I live in California now," suddenly everyone has a lot of questions about movie stars, surfing, and the weather.For better or worse, people view California as the best state in the union, or at least, the most interesting.	0.0

My [3x3](http://www.tapmusic.net/collage.php?user=KingOfSpain000&amp;type=7day&amp;size=3x3&amp;caption=true) for the week.**Donnie Trumpet and the Social Experiment -** *Surf* (2015)Listened to this for the first time about 4 days ago and it's been the most played thing all week!  I really dig it even though I'm not much of a hip hop fan at all.  But I have a weak spot for Chance and this album is so uplifting.  **8/10****Unknown Mortal Orchestra -** *Multi-Love* (2015)I meant to check this out when it was getting some hype on this sub when it first released but just got around to it.  I'm pretty into a few of the tracks (Multi love, Can't Keep Checking my Phone, Necessary Evil), but there are also a few dead songs here too.  The production quality is great though.  If I had a better sound system I'd probably like it much more.  Overall pretty solid.  **6.5/10**I liked Multi Love enough to check out UMO's first album which I think is *okay*... I suppose.  It's a peg or two lower than their latest but it's still worth checking out if you haven't yet.  The first track is pretty great!  Also been playing *In Colour* now for about two months straight and it's still my favorite of the year so far.  Can't say enough about it.  Oh yeah... and also, this track called "Truth" by that band Alexander there... it's awesome.  So awesome that it alone has made it look like I've been playing that whole album all week (I haven't).	0.0

Between these small classes, lab portions of the classes, and professor's office hours, there is never a shortage of time that you can interact with or get help from professors.  For what it's worth, all of the girls I've seen in the major have been, or at least seemed, very successful. Regardless of gender, Cal Poly CSC/SE/CPE majors are highly sought after by industry.I'm sure a female student could give you a better perspective though.	0.0

TCW is supposed to show us Anakin in his prime when he's a hero of the Republic.  The movies show us Anakin before and after that period.  He was a great Jedi for the Clone Wars because the conflict allowed him to focus on just being a warrior.  Nothing in Anakin's character was ever very well suited for the philosopher/mediator side of a Jedi's existence, and with the Clone Wars in full swing he could ignore those aspects and just be a warrior.  Before the conflict he couldn't really *fit* himself into the life a Jedi peacekeeper because he wasn't well suited to it.  And at the end of the war not only was he about to see the defining era of his life fade out but was faced with the death of Padme- who was his only real link to anything other than war.  Without Palpatine's manipulation he might well have been able to outgrow his focus on being a great warrior, but he would have had to deal with one hell of a "who am I now that I don't have a war to fight?" crisis.	0.0

Thank you for sharing your story. I imagine it is difficult to practice a faith so tied up with nationalism. Your approach is much different than the one that led me to Orthodoxy. In my opinion what matters most is a simple question: Do I believe that this faith tradition best represents Truth? If you are really convinced at this point in your life that Protestantism, Roman Catholicism, and Eastern Orthodoxy are all relatively equal, then so be it. I would encourage you to study church history and theology, though.	0.0

It kind of does sound reasonable, but then for me it hit a wall as soon as I started to think about why the Russians would want to hijack an airliner filled with people. If they wanted to demonstrate something they should've announced it already or the CIA would've made things obvious that it was them who did it if the Kremlin was doing it secretly, and the latter contradicts the demonstration part. If they wanted to use it as a flying bomb they could've simply used a decommissioned bomber or an idle Aeroflot aircraft instead of having to go through the trouble of hijacking an airliner from another country filled with passengers (what to do with these people once the plane is acquired?)	0.0

Thanks for the questions! Yes, I see how that is unclear now. The table top is attached to the frame only by those little blocks. [Here's a detail picture](http://i.imgur.com/fv8d2rG.jpg) showing how the leg is bolted on and two of the attachment blocks.If I did this table over, I would make the overall frame wider to extend to the edges of the table. ([picture](http://i.imgur.com/EdLRo3t.jpg)) The one deficiency in this design is that if a large amount of downforce is applied to the very edge of the table (think a 200 lb man standing on the edge), it is only supported by the plywood.  This design is a trade off because I wanted the table to be easily able to be disassembled since our apartment is not on the ground floor, so when I move, this will have to go down a tiny, curving stairwell.You could make the table with the legs on the outside corners, but I like having them inset so people can sit at the corners.For other options on what you can do, watch [this review of a Geek Chiq table](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XhvYiAUYo). You can see how they made the frame in it. Unfortunately, I found this AFTER I started building my table.	0.0

Start by just listening to jazz. Miles Davis "Kind of Blue" is a great place to start. George Benson, Pat metheny, AL Di meola are some fantastic jazz guitarists. Also, check snarky puppy for some modern jazz/fusion. Now as you're listening you'll hear lots of "Loaded" chords. These are the chords that have accidentals. b9, aug13, diminished and all those. But the most common is a dominant 7 chord. With jazz you can't take the average guitarists approach of x chord = G. If the music calls for a G half diminished add 9 you have to know what that is. Now you learn a voicing for major 7, minor 7, and dominant 7 chords. The addition of the 7th note is what gives jazz it's sound, combined with the jazz styled voicing. The thing that makes Jazz sound like Jazz is that it's chord voicing are so different from that of rock, with its power chords. You can play variations of bar chords to form a Dm7 chord, but if you want it to sound Jazzy learn what's called a 3/7 voicing. The 3/7 voicing puts emphasis on the two flavor notes of a chord. The 3rd and the 7th are the notes that are most often changed by the accidentals, so they're the most critical to play. These voicings highlight them. For example, E7. Open low e. 7 on A with middle finger, 6 on D with first, ring on 7 G. Open across the other strings. This is the hendrix chord, it's just a dominant 7 chord. Now let's say the next chord is A7. To voice this chord I would play 5 on low e with thumb, mute 5th string, 5th fret D string, 6th G, 5th B. Now look at your D and G strings. These are the strings that voice the 3rd and 7th. With the E it was 3/7. With the A however it's 7/3. Remember how those 2 are the most important notes? Well this thing called the 3/7 switch means that in a blues/wherever chords move in 4ths, you can change chords just by playing those two notes and moving a half step apart. Hopefully that will help get your feet wet, I can help a lot more later. Gotta do irl shit first though! Edit:as for good yet easy, learn the "head" of the jazz song's. This is the chorus. Sunny moon for two is just about the easiest head on the planet. "So What"  by Miles Davis is 2 notes. If you desire to read sheet music, the most valuable jazz book you can own is "The Real Book" it has hundreds of jazz standards in it varying from very easy to extremely difficult. I suggest picking it up at some point.	0.0

It's hard to make predictions without a crystal ball unfortunately. Economics tries to predict the future using the past, but it's not an exact science. Many things could happen, and in the short term our economy might be in for some very rough times, but here's the thing: busts happen, and generally recoveries follow. Some possible scenarios are unemployment rising, consumer sentiment diving, the dollar plunging to 50c, wages dropping and the housing market crashes. All or none of these could happen.But reflect on this: in many ways out housing market is like the Shanghai stock exchange, which also started going up as it was encouraged by favourable government policy and programs to encourage house price growth, as this encourages investment and creates jobs (in China's case, they basically built ghost towns, and those jobs are evaporating now it's become apparent no one actually ever needed all the houses built but enough about that). Investors saw stock prices going up and bought in, which mades prices go up more, which made more investors pile in. Sometimes, this process of greed and excitement gets out of control, as it did in Shanghai - puffing up prices way beyond fundamentals (like wages, company profits etc). Yet still, investors - especially mum and dad investors - see the market going up up up and believe it is a sure thing so many borrow up big to also buy in, often for fear of missing out, often because they see everyone else getting rich (sound familiar?), and prices go up even more. Trouble is, the only ones getting rich (borrowing up to your eyeballs doesn't count if you're still in debt) are the ones who bought in very, very early - probably out of blind luck or timing - and they're only staying rich as long as the delusions of those masses buying in persist. In Shanghai, the whole house of cards is falling to pieces because that investor sentiment turned. People realised there was never anything supporting it all but greed: so everyone's trying to cash out at once. In order to get back in line with fundamentals, it's got a loooong way to fall.Our housing market is also way out of step with fundamentals.	0.0

I'm a bit more obsessive when it comes to the calorie data (to the point that even /u/linkynet was getting worried), so I can completely understand your worry. I live by my food scale, though. You don't necessarily need to track, but you can certainly weigh out your portions and get a *general* idea of how many calories you're eating in a day. Eventually you get to the point that you can get a good idea of what a serving size is. I've learned that my handful of chips generally equals out to 28g/1 oz which is a serving. Maybe a written diary of the calories for a couple of weeks can help you? That way, you'll get an estimate of how your general nutrition looks but you're not obsessing. I've found that MFP can make me want to track *every little thing* and that doesn't help when you're trying to avoid any ED. The USDA has a [database](http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search) too of some more hard-to-count foods and it's variations to help you. You can compare grilled vs. raw chicken, steamed vs. roasted broccoli, etc.	0.0

Ahh, there you go. I wondered how long it'd take for true colours to come out.1) An intelligent person who seems to be agreed with by most, and is indeed one of the Four Horsemen. Sounds plenty complimentary to me.2) ... and tries to place sharia OVER human rights, which was the problem we were discussing in the first place. Sharia-well-its-a-guideline-but-you-are-free-to-ignore-it wouldn't be a problem, but that's not what we we talking about.3) Great, so in your 'true scotsman' version of sharia I can print pictures of mohammed fellating a pig, can I?  4) ... and respects equal rights for women ... and doesn't consider non-muslims as 'lower' ... and respects freedom of expression ... and doesn't place religious priests as judge and jury on anyone, etc. The *problem* is that these are not rejected by all muslims, and that a significant percentage hold to those ideas - which are counter to basic human rights.5) And as I said, if adults want to quietly be vegans, that's their own problem. But that's not, practically, what's on offer.Keep religion inside your head and make sure it impacts nobody but you and we wouldn't have a problem. But that doesn't happen, particularly if you don't expressly keep it out of laws and decision making.	0.0

I was looking at the Manga and I think Mihawk was just chasing Don Krieg for fun. If you're reading an English volume, Mihawk gives his answer in chapter 50 page 118. Then on page 162 Don Krieg asks mihawk "Didn't you come for my head?" Then mihawk tell Krieg that washis intention but he had enough fun. Krieg attacks him, Mihawk says you're a slow learner and vanishes with a slash of his sword. Also before this happen the ship is a wreck and Krieg said that his crew is wounded and dying. So, in my opinion he was just chasing Don Krieg for shits and giggles. Edit it's volume 9	0.0

Yeah, there's also a lot of other hinters as the first digit numbers.1: 1,1,1,1...2: 2,4,8,6,2,4,8,6...3: 3,9,7,1,3,9,7,1...4: 4,6,4,6,4,6...5: 5,5,5,5,5...6: 6,6,6,6,6....7: 7,9,3,1,7,9,3,1...8: 8,4,2,6,8,4,2,6..9: 9,1,9,1,9,1..Might be possible to determine the number like that pretty easily. especially if you remember the rules for the second and 3rd place of every digit.We know that the last digit is 1.Therefore the next digit must be 3 ( 7 on the second digit.)Edit: Actually, it's much harder. You need to know a two digit number (with the last digit being 1) which gives you 7 on the second digit when powered by 23. By calculating from 9^23 I think it's 9 but I'm not sure. since I did a lot of calculations in my headthen the next digit must be 5. (since the third digit is 7, and 3^23 leaves a 2 on the second digit. (Not too hard to calculate, since all you need is to carry  whatever is left from the first digit))Edit: Here you need to know a three digit number which ends with 91, which would give you 7 as the third digit when powered by 23.After calculating each digit ^23 on early digits I came up with 8. However, if you memorize each digit to the power of 20,15 and 10, you can calculate all of these at much greater speed than I did. And several of the digits are redundant (9 is 3^2, 8 is 2^3, 4 is 2^2, 1 and 0 are constant. And 2 are very easy to memorize (Anyone doesn't know how many bits in 1kbit?)). Also you need only remember the first 8 digits of these numbers (if they reach 8 digits).And etc...still it get's harder each step.Might be worth on the last number or two to calculate using the first digit instead, although I don't think it's an easy series.Edit: My bad forgot to carry the 9^23*1 and the following carry from earlier digits, so my calculations for 2nd and 3rd digit were bullshit. ( Though the theory in it is still legit, though much harder then I initially thought)	0.0

&gt; Sex is the quickest way to establish a meaningful relationship between characters, Monhier explained, **and to justify Geralt's pursuit of Yennefer.** "We couldn't just tell you to go find someone you don't know or care about," he said. "It wouldn't work."This is what bugs me. Ignoring the woeful lack of originality in going with the Damsel in Distress plot, they think the only way to justify the player caring about her enough to want to go rescue her is by showing what she means to Geralt. That's so fucking boring. How about making us want to rescue her for her own sake - because she's interesting, likeable, funny, or sweet? Someone we actually care about, whether or not Geralt has stuck his dick in her. Dude has stuck his dick in nearly every woman he has come across in these games. That doesn't make someone particularly special in this regard. If her only development is that she spreads her legs for the main character... urgh.This is where Bioware absolutely trounces CDPR I'm afraid. The development of the companion characters is amazing. If Dorian went missing, I would tear apart Thedas looking for him - even if I wasn't and couldn't ever be in a relationship with him. I do not need to have sex with any one of those characters to give a crap about them, because Bioware did a fantastic job of defining their characters and making them compelling. There is more compelling romance in Cullen getting tongue-tied over being smiled at than there ever was in a single Witcher sex scene. The scene where you find Cassandra reading a romance novel is profoundly more endearing than just seeing her naked.This is something CDPR has yet to understand. Sex in video games is awesome and I love it. But it shouldn't be there as a substitute for real character development or as a cheap way to illustrate meaningful relationships (especially if you've already established that sex for this character is often meaningless).	0.0

Oh, I'd definitely start with the Fountainhead. It's much easier going and reads more like a novel - Atlas Shrugged has much more of the manifesto feel to it. I don't know if they're going to anger you - for me I think what made me immune to annoyance at them was that I didn't take the ideology remotely seriously. In fact, I didn't know that I was supposed to. I'm not American and grew up in a very, *very* socialist European country. When the characters started reeling off their more extreme neo-liberal beliefs, tbh I just treated those as part of the dystopian setting. I had no clue there were people out there that took this sort of stuff seriously and could have been blown over with feather when I found out there were!What I liked about the books was the combination of dystopian fantasy with an epic feel. I'm a huge fan of fantasy (which is also probably why I'm more easygoing about the endless descriptions and general droning that other people complain about - that's just part of the worldbuilding!) But these books felt really fresh and new to me, because instead of being set in a parallel fairyland they were set in a hypothetical future of our world. I loved that. As for whether they helped me round my perspective of different ideologies, well, I dunno. I read them when I was 20 and while they definitely affected my political thinking, they in no way made me less left-wing - so I guess yes? For me it made a huge, huge difference that Rand herself grew up in Russia and fled for the US because of the revolution. Although I'm honestly rather sympathetic to communism as an ideology, I can definitely see how somebody who lived through that particular application of the theory might not be great fan - so I found it really interesting to see the world through the eyes of somebody pushed by their experiences to the opposite extreme. And well, they definitely helped me not become so annoyingly smug I judge people on their favourite books, so that's a nice plus :PEdit: just as a psa, the sex scenes are rather rapey. That I did not like. I think it's clear that they're not meant to be taken as actual rape, because we get to see what's happening through the eyes of the heroine and she's clearly enjoying what's going on, but given that in the real world people can't mind-read and our hero has no way of knowing she's secretly into it, it was rather disturbing.	0.0

&gt; Or maybe we shouldent put morality, an arbitrary distinction, on a pedestal.This is circular. You cannot assert that morality is subjective in your defense of the claim that it is subjective.&gt;Maybe morality is an obsolete way of looking at the world.I'm not sure what you mean by this, but one could tack "maybe" onto any claim. Maybe morality isn't an obsolete way of looking a the world.&gt;Maybe we have better language and better metrics to guide our life.This is nonsensical. Any metric as a guide to life just would be a normative theory, of which moral theories are a subset.&gt;Maybe we have science and we shouldent try to transpose the new onto the old.Hold on. Science studies objective phenomenon, but you've said earlier that morality is subjective. Are you changing your view?&gt;Ill quote you as evidence.The quote from me is evidence that different cultures associate different extensions with morality, not that they have different definitions.&gt;If something is objective it is universally true and independently verifiable without regard to the subject making the measure.But I haven't said that morality is objective. Morality could fail to be subjective without being objective. See, for instance, the error theory which I mentioned above.Listen, you seem way out of your league.

As a support main fuck that there's hardly any reason to upgrade any of them other than ancient coin at the moment; the gold cost for the t3 version is more than most supports can afford off-hand and the bonuses granted are hardly worth it any more (no gp5 increase on frostfang over spellthiefs, only the on hit bonus, and against most lanes, that's not nearly enough to warrant me to spend 500 gold, I'd rather get boots or my upgraded sweeper). In fact, frost queens claim is the last thing I build, with ruby sightstone being bought only because it's cheaper. If I could combine my spellthief/frostfang with sightstone for a "frost stone" that was slightly lower in stats and didn't have the slowing active but rather an on-hit or an aura instead of the frost queens claim active, I'd buy that 100% of the time over the two separate. Think about it like this: most junglers have to only waste one spot for their items (only jungler that doesn't is sightstone Lee sin), why not be nice to supports too? I only get 3 actual spots for items, and one of them always has to be a defensive. So really, I get a choice in the game of any goddamn 2 items, instead of a build. 3 would be a giant step up.	0.0

My optician whom prescribed me contact lenses told me to use eye baths (eye wash?) as an additional step to prevent protein buildup. So yes, they work!

You can get an over-the-counter ear drop which will soften your ear wax for it to fall out naturally (not allowed to dig ears yo!), or go to the doctor to get an ear irrigation. The doctor will prescribe ear drops to soften the ear wax, and perform an irrigation a week later. Sounds gross but I could hear every single droplet of water flowing out of the tap when I got my ears cleaned out. I now do it once every 2 years..Also, looking at that amount of ear wax built up over er... 20 years was morbidly fascinating :x	0.0

Honest disagreement or me not being the clearest communicator is completely different, I enjoy discourse and will answer questions asked of me. But they're not interested in what I think. They're interested in whatever cartoonish version of what I think exists in their minds. Notice how they never ask where I stand on the things they criticize me of, they just proclaim. I will not be put on the defense, backing away from accusations that have no basis in reality. When faced with that I either ignore them or go on the offense.	0.0

&gt; Anything I can do at this point to return my score to its former height, or am I SOL?You made a lot of elementary mistakes.  First, the USPS does not forward mail forever.  There are strict time limits depending on the class of mail.  Some will be forwarded 6 months, some for a year.Also, just because you pay a late payment or a charged off account, that does not mean your score will improve!  That negative mark will stay on your report for seven years.  If you did not get a pay for delete agreement in writing, then you can try a Goodwill Letter.Other than a Goodwill Letter, you are out of options.  Legally, they are required to report accurate information.  By agreeing to a Goodwill Letter, they are violating their agreements with the credit bureaus.

1. Very involved. We talk about everything related to this lifestyle and I am involved in every decision she makes regarding partners and dates. I also help her find and/or screen potential partners. For us, this is a joint lifestyle that we both throughly enjoy and one that enriches our marriage because we are fully in it together. We joke that this is now our hobby!2. Yes, that's one of our rules. The quantity that I get depends on the partner and what they do, and what they are able to get in the midst of their activities.3. Yes, when my schedule permits. I work a lot, so it's not possible for me to be there every time she has a date. I prefer to watch it live, but if I needed to be there every time, she wouldn't get to play very often. But I am always welcome to be there.4. What do I get out of it? It turns me on tremendously to share her with others. Nothing we have done in our 20 years together has been more exciting for me than her hotwifing. Hearing about, and seeing her with, other partners is beyond exciting. And, it has also awakened her sexuality and made her a more confident lover. Our sex life has never been better than it is right now, both quantity and quality. For us it has strengthened our marriage in ways we never could have anticipated.	0.0

Congratulations! You've, all by yourself, hit upon (or close to, it may not be entirely the same thing) a probable truth that some scientists are testing and writing about. Namely, the dangers of positive fantasies about outcome. Gabrielle Oettingen in particular has done a lot of work on this, she's done quite some studies confirming a link between positive fantasies and less motivation for doing the actual work (indeed helped by fooling your brain with the fantasies) . She developed a countermeasure that you and the others here might be interested in. See for example http://www.progressfocused.com/2014/10/rethinking-positive-thinking-by.html?m=1But if you Google there's quite some easy to read studies on the subject.	0.0

I don't know the numbers specifically, but I can offer a couple more points: maintenance and moving parts. Adding some sort of system to spin up the tires to the landing gear creates a system with moving parts on a piece that takes a massive impulse every flight. Anything breaking creates delays and part costs. Also, there isn't a lot of space on a landing gear for that type of system. Landing gears are solid; the a milled from one single piece of material. You can't hollow them out and add a system of gears and axles to save tires; it would sacrifice longevity and cycles on the gear itself.Know what I mean? It just complicates things and adds variables to one of the most beaten up pieces of a plane.	0.0

I think this topic is different because from what I've seen this week it seems like a lot of people are incapable of rational discussion.

I like the weekly controversy thread idea, but people still need to be respectful.	0.0

While it's awesome that he plugged GMI, I question the rest of the article, and the liberal quest to make the contractor economy look like an employee model (speaking as a liberal). Reich cites studies on the negative effects of "uncertain" jobs, but those jobs also pay less; I haven't looked at the research, but I'm confident that earnings are the real driver. I just don't buy his claim that income insurance and benefits covered by the 50%+ employer is simpler; what about those with 3 employers, or the self-employed, or just those without jobs?It's becoming increasingly clear that proposals to address the contractor economy short of GMI/UBI/universal healthcare can only increase complexity. Liberals should double down on universal benefits instead of settling for half-baked whack-a-mole ideas plus a halfhearted footnote.	0.0

I have severe social anxiety. You have the power to tell yourself you can overcome it. You have to believe in yourself though. You may not like being teased, but guess what? It's going to happen no matter what. So instead of thinking about your anxiety and how much you hate it, be more optimistic about it and laugh too. You did the right thing, took the right precautions and you still have your job. Laugh about it with them. Trust me, the more you laugh and the more you become optimistic, it helps your anxiety because laughing eases it. Keep your chin up, stay optimistic, don't over-exaggerate things that aren't a big deal and laugh. Or you can always be honest and tell them your condition and don't like being laughed at.	0.0

Thank you for an excellent post which filled in a lot of information that I didn't know (and I consider myself fairly well informed).It is both horrifying and desperately sad that this administration has produced not one, but SEVERAL other scandals as least as serious as F&amp;F (IRS, Benghazi and the spying on journalists, in my opinion of descending order of seriousness): and yet BO's approval ratings are still in the 40s-50s.This is largely because of the American mainstream press: utterly compromised, coopted and useless to society since 2008. For seven years now they have functioned as the unpaid propaganda arm of what is probably the most corrupt, incompetent presidential administration in US history. (Possible exception for the Grant and Buchanan administrations.)I actually feel sorry for all the left kids on this site. It's really not their fault, they are just repeating what they were told to think; I used to be just like them. But if you are in that category, and you really want to know why so many people watch Fox News and listen to Rush, check all the links in the above post, make up your own mind, then ask yourself "why is this not newsworthy?" Internally the problem is all the Obamoids are true believers. They are so passionate about what they are doing that the rule of law is just an inconvenience to them. Unfortunately, in a republic the rule of law is everything; once you lose that, you lose it all. The press was all we had to correct this and they didn't. So here we are.	0.0

If you're going to college and he's looking for work, what's your childcare situation like? It might be worth staying home with your parents to make childcare easier. It's tough to go it alone even without a baby, so it'll definitely be difficult to get your feet under you with one. Also, I don't want to scare you or make presumptions about your relationship, but parenthood rattles even the strongest marriage. Often, the only thing keeping me from completely flipping out on my husband is the fact I've committed to being with him -- and we have a GOOD marriage. It's just that hard, with a newborn. If this young man isn't duly committed to you during the newborn phase, chances are that he is going to bounce when in gets tough. Whatever you do, be prepared for that. Commit, at least, to a written agreement with exit clauses and responsibilities should you go your separate ways.	0.0

Take a tolerance break.I was a daily smoker and then I was put on probation and had to stop.Within two weeks I honestly noticed a change.It's been a little over a month now and I still feel better. Will I quit smoking for good? No. I love it too much. However this gave me some insight on what it's like to not be high all the time. I think once I'm off probation I might make weed a weekend-only thing. If that.Not only have I discovered more motivation, but I now have time for the other things I could be doing. If quitting for a while just isn't an option for you, and you are open to trying other drugs, I would suggest trying Vyvanse.It's a prescription stimulant that gives a lot of clarity and focus, along with more motivation.Plus, smoking weed while on stimulants feels so good. It doesn't give you the "dumbness" of being high. You just feel great.	0.0

He's a defensive midfielder who is very apt as a CB, which gives him a bit of ability and tranquility on the ball. I.e., he is not limited to chucking it away.Herrera, to me, is an automatic starter. He has energy, intelligence, pace, tackling, simple pass, through balls, long ranged shots, *and* he's been playing in a similar style to van Gaal's philosophy for the last 3 or 4 years.Rooney wouldn't be in midfield. He can have great accuracy, but his timing isn't always the best. So he'd play either as a number 10 or as a second striker, who can obviously go down and feed other players too. Mata has a lot of skill, but defenses and midfields know how to play against him by now. Just stick to his back, don't let him turn around. He will fall down. I think he'd benefit from Herrera's presence, as Mata can receive the ball with his back to goal, play a one-touch pass to Herrera, move away from the defender on his back and into the box, so that Herrera can become a temporary number 10 as Mata and our 2 strikers are inside the box.Oh, and I put Rafael as RB because... I don't know. He hasn't been good for a couple of months, but he's usually better than Valencia there.And at least during this season, I've been shocked by the inconsistency of our 'senior' CBs. Smalling can be rock solid for one or two games, and the next match he looks as if he's shitting his pants. I guess what bothers me the most is that Evans, Smalling and Jones at times look desperate. Maybe they aren't, but they *look* like they are. You know, running around, like not being sure where they should be and where the ball is going to end up next. In the match against Southampton Blackett allowed the Soton player to be onside for the shot that bounced off the post, but he's a kid and you can forgive that. Smalling and Jones were all over the place for that one.	0.0
Exactly.If we could keep Tats and get a top 4 RPMD, that'd be preferred of course. But if they start offering Shea Weber or something for Tatar I take it. It's all about the return package. Who knows what value he has around the league now. Young, fast, skilled, obviously not a flash in the pan goal scorer with 19 last season.But anyone who doesn't want him gone at any price need not worry. This is Ken Holland. When was the last time we traded a roster player? Tats is about as safe as you can get on this team without being an untouchable. They're gonna move Helm before Tats.	0.0
Alex Gordon is actually an interesting comparison to Hanley, no? I mean, Gordon was considered a massive bust as the 3B of the future and he moved to LF without much, if any, experience. He had superior baseball IQ and athleticism that helped him become an elite left fielder. That's what many expect Hanley to do. He could realistically have the highest WAR among left fielders next season with a good part of that due to defense.	0.0

&gt;Shouldn't a country's laws should comply with sharia, slavery is allowed in sharia (With specifics of course), when a country punishes people for something that God won't punish us for, they're opposing sharia? The answer to your question is here:&gt;The first thing we should understand about slavery is that it is not an integral part of Islam such as praying, fasting, the prohibition of interest, etc. **As such, it is amenable to being rejected without any sin falling on the one rejecting it.** &gt;The fact that slavery is not an integral part of Islam also means that **fatwas associated with it are amenable to change with changing circumstances**&gt;The widespread rejection of slavery among Muslims approaches the level of irreproachable consensus as it has become the 'Urf or convention of the Muslim people. In this case, such convention has legal authority. &gt;Another relevant legal principle is consideration of the future harm resulting from implementing a ruling. This principle is subordinate to the principle of removing the means that lead to an unlawful end, even if those means, in some cases, are themselves lawful.Also I suggest you look into the two major concepts of Shari'ah , *Sadd al-dhara'i‘* and *al-darar yuzalu* http://www.muhajabah.com/docstorage/dutton.htm	0.0

My wife is a lawyer who has read several RP books.  She catches most of her Shit Tests now but a couple weeks ago we were both sick with that flu.  She was in a bad mood and asked me to get her a juice box.  We were both sitting at the table and both equally close to the fridge.  I paused for several seconds and smiled, but then my curiosity got the better of me and I complied.  Total failure of an obvious Shit Test.  I knew it and just wanted to see how it played out.Can you guess what happened?  Within SECONDS of getting her juice box she started to crab and pick a fight with me.  It only took seconds and she had NO IDEA what she was doing.  None.  TLDR:  AWALT	0.0

I just went through something similar with a rental condo and I will share the advice my agent told me. Check similar units in your area for rent/sale and see what the condition and style tends to look like. You would not get a very good ROI on installing granite if you are the only unit in the building with an updated kitchen. You would be better off waiting until just before selling and putting in new laminate counters or a cheaper tiled granite counter. If you are in a trendy community and you see concrete, granite, quartz, and interesting stuff all over... then maybe quartz would make sense. If you are somewhere in the middle and see that the trend is leaning towards granite slabs, then I would consider going to a slab yard directly and asking if they have any discount slabs they could install.Also, what is the condition of the cabinets and the kitchen in general? Don't put granite over 15 year old particle board or melamine cabinets. Generally, granite only adds value if the entire kitchen is relatively modern or has good solid wood cabinets. If you ever change the cabinets, it is very unlikely that you can re-use the granite.	0.0

To deny a warranty claim legally they have to prove that your change caused the failure. If you have the stock tune on it their evidence would have to be really substantial.

I'm pretty sure they're normal sized cars.Speeds are measured in MPH/kmH, allowing us to calculate the distance a ball has traveled by timing the speed of the ball from when it was hit to when it enters the net.Using [my own video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh8ZE0mGrtY), my shot had a speed of 47 mph. I timed it at 0.723 seconds, which is 0.0002008333 hours. Multiply that by our speed (47), and we get 0.0094391651 miles. Multiply that by 5280 to get our number of feet, and we get 49.838791728 feet. So the ball travelled almost 50 feet, which seems entirely too large a distance for RC cars.So, my conclusion is that these are full-sized (but possibly still remotely controlled- they don't have doors) cars. (Now, being that I'm terrible at math, someone tell me why my methodology suck, or this doesn't give us any conclusive information.)EDIT: We could probably get more accurate distance information by doing these calculations with a rolling ball, since the ball isn't traveling a straight line in this clip. That said, we'd need to account for friction with a rolling ball; we'd still need to do even more math. So. Yeah.	0.0

So, we're not all Calvinists, so no. You might want to read some Saint Isaac of Nineveh.&gt;What is a merciful heart? It is a heart on fire for the whole of creation, for humanity, for the birds, for the animals, for demons, and for all that exists. By the recollection of them the eyes of a merciful person pour forth tears in abundance. By the strong and vehement mercy that grips such a person’s heart, and by such great compassion, the heart is humbled and one cannot bear to hear or to see any injury or slight sorrow in any in creation. For this reason, such a person offers up tearful prayer continually even for irrational beasts, for the enemies of the truth, and for those who harm her or him, that they be protected and receive mercy. And in like manner such a person prays for the family of reptiles because of the great compassion that burns without measure in a heart that is in the likeness of God.	0.0

There are solutions out there, but as far as I'm concerned people are using "the blockchain" for catch-all term. There are ways to do a voting system, but they would require some ZK proofs to make it work.I actually think using a smart-card system with some clever zk-SNARKs could probably fit the bill. The solution doesn't really need to involve a block chain at all really, and would no doubt make it more complicated.	0.0

The one to arm and stat your character gets my vote.

Croyne is a big target, what with his scary future tech and all, so I'm hoping he can draw aggro while being buffed and healed by Aun. Aun also works as a rallying point, his leadership being the highest availaible at the start.After completing Orion's Ascension to Psychonauta, I'm a reality warper, so I don't really think too much else matters in terms of planning.

How are you not getting this? I'm specifically addressing the guy's reaction to the difference between the PC and PS4 screenshots. One is 1080p. The other is essentially the same pictures, BUT DOWNSAMPLED FROM 4K. If marketing for a game decided to use screenshots downsampled from 4K to advertise their game, people would be calling bullshit immediately, because it's such a huge difference. Also, even at 1080p, I can assure you that you'll still need a build significantly more expensive to run it with the effects and draw distance present in these screenshots.	0.0

Amen! I don't think your harsh. Your spot on and I'm so sorry your going thru what your going thru. Everything you said couldn't be truer. This cheating and affair BS is narcissism at its finest. "My sexual needs aren't met" blah blah so that makes you entitled to cheat? Get a divorce for fucks sake then get your shit met. Marriage is give and take, about sacrificing. If you can't sacrifice the bedroom (and use a viable alternative like masturbation) then you shouldn't be married in the first place. Affairs wreck kids and they wreck marriages. At the same time I do truly feel bad for most of the people on this subreddit. You'll never know what it's like to experience a true marriage to that one perfect person. Those old school marriages that many of our grandparents had, 50-60 years married and no affairs are a thing of the past. Not because it's not a viable form but instead because we've grown into a wretched, selfish and entitled society and this subreddit is a perfect example of that.	0.0
&gt;So there is a slight contradiction having higher FOV and better performance.Not necessarily.  I certainly feel like performance issues are feel *very* disparate from my potato's ability to render things on the screen.  Like many other folks on this sub, PoE isn't my only game, and when I'm having no performance issues in other resource-intensive games played at demanding settings, but PoE experiences huge stutters, predicatble FPS probelms related to weather and particle effects, repeated "texture not loaded" graphical errors or internal slowdowns due to mass boxed-mob loading it's hard to not look at the game and feel like there is a *lot* of room for improvement in fairly foundation-level performance issues.  Why does PoE struggle more to deliver a consistent responsiveness experience while consuming fewer resources than other games that have no similar problems?  When everything is working *well* it's not a hugely burdensome game to run.  So yeah, optimize first, but I think the amount of optimization to be done would more than leave room for the extra 100-200 objects on screen that a wider FOV would bring.	0.0

I haven't read most of the comments and this isn't technically how I treat vanilla servers, but I was a total dick to this one clan of guys on a battlefield server. I noticed there was a "/kit rocket" which allowed you one launcher and 10 rockets with a 5 or 10 minute cool down. These guys built a massive fucking armored base that was just calling for me to destroy it. I kept bolt headshotting this one guy down nearly everytime, also dealing with the random scrubs trying to interfere. I made it my mission to level this thing until there was nothing left. At one point the guy said, "Dude! WHY?! This took me so long :'(" and I think I retorted, "Ah shit, it's a dick move man I'm sorry but your base just annoys the fuck out of me". Needless to say, I destroyed every last part of it. Sometimes it's just fun to be a dick. Other times I really like helping people out. I don't think this clears anything up, so yeah....haha	0.0

Sorry for being rude previously - I assumed way too much about you.  But hear me out:If I say "there may be some black people smart enough to be doctors" that implies that I dont know whether or not there are any black people who are smart enough to be doctors.  Its perfectly obvious that there are a lot of black people smart enough to be doctors - so suggesting that it's even a question is  suggests you have a distorted view of black people.Similarly, phrasing a sentence as though there is a possibility that all police shootings are justified implies a distorted view of police injustices.Im being accused of pedantic nitpicking, which is a sensible reaction to comments like mine. Why, after all, should I focus on your phrasing instead of your overall message? However, in this particular case, phrasing really matters.  Prejudice against people - including prejudice against people who have been shot by police - operates largely in the subconscious.  Social psychologists, when studying biases, often use peoples word choice as a way to access their biases.  Of course there is great debate about the extent to which word choice correlates with prejudice - but it certainly does.	0.0

&gt; Obviously I don't think racial matters don't matter.You just think they don't matter enough to disrupt the daily lives of people over it, right?Well many people of color disagree, with the reason being that their own daily lives are disrupted over racial discrimination. People who condemn the disruption from the protests often don't realize or care that black people's lives are already being disrupted, so they don't think the protest/disruption is justified. If they looked at it from the POV of a black person, they might change their mind.	0.0

I don't know. The only DC reality warpers I can think of are villains.

And a hell of a lot more speedsters. I think that Superman being their most popular character for so long affected a lot of the other DC characters causing them to be physically stronger to compete.Just look at the Avengers then look at the Justice League. Now ask yourself how many of these people would die if you shot them in the head with a handgun? You'd have more dead Avengers than Justice Leaguers.	0.0

So I'll just get this out of the way and say that hands down, the Taranis beats everything on the market right now, including transmitters over 3x the cost.Now, the details. For $200 you can get a tried and true spektrum d6x. Some of the features include: * 6 channels of dsm2/dsmx radio output.* A practically unlimited capacity for storing various models in memory* voice alerts for certain events* several preprogrammed templates for different aircraft types.* telemetry* 5 programable mixes* preprogrammed differential settingsNow, the Taranis costs pretty much the same, and has:* 16 channels of a slightly more robust protocol, with support for the same dsm2/dsmx protocols with an inexpensive module. Up to 32 if you get crazy and by another kind of module.* A practically unlimited capacity for storing various models in memory* Voice alerts for pretty much anything you feel like.* A 100% flexible programming scheme that lets you set it up for anything you could possibly want.* telemetry* up to 32 (?) programable mixes* again, if you can think it, it can do it.The only thing the d6x has that the taranis might be lacking on is build quality. The taranis is a plastic shell construction, the d6x has some molded rubber bits. The gimals are pretty much the same though.	0.0

Whole lot of backpedaling there.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine&gt; The Palestinians weren't even a thing until decades after this whole time period. They did not have a unified democratic government. They werent even a nation.They would have been if they accepted the deal....which they rejected in an effort to get more land. &gt; The Israeli declaration of an exclusively Jewish state that was 40% Arab populated **and where 60% of the land was owned by Arabs did not seem like a good deal to the Arabs of the time.**Try again. The Jews had been purchasing the land from the Turks for years. They owned the land which they were building their state on. If you have a cite then post it because you are lying.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_land_purchase_in_Palestine&gt; My country did a lot of fucked up shit in the past.And?

The first part of what you said applies to *any* denomination, really. Otherwise, that denomination wouldn't be separate from the others.The second part of what you said really comes down to a question of authority. After all, if I believe a teaching is true, I don't want someone questioning it to their harm. The second part really boils down to a question of authority - does the Catholic Church have the authority to declare that certain teachings are correct and true?Well, as part of the original Church, they definitely have a claim to authority, since the Church did originally believe that God guided his Church and preserved them from error. By examining the early church's writings, it's evident that the first generations of Christ believed this to be true. As one small point of evidence - both the Orthodox and Catholic Churches, the remnants of the first Church, hold that the Church as a whole is infallible.Historically, Christians have believed in the infallibility of the Church in the matters of faith and morals. The Catholic Church continues that tradition today. Whether they have the authority to do that is another matter, but it is not an unprecedented position.	0.0

How did the final boss get good RNG? He literally had won the game, and got lethal 1 turn earlier by getting old murk eye. Kripp had already lost the game on turn 4, his insistence on playing Ram Wrangler is just lowering his winrate - its not even a win more card as kripp called it. Its a card with high variance, that CAN win more, but can also turn a winning game into an even one if you get a crappy beast and thus lose so much tempo. Kripps actually a really good player. I've finished top 100 last 2 seasons, and i have no doubt he's a better player than me - he just needs to play more constructed and not play joke stuff.	0.0
&gt; No shit. It's the CDC, suicides and accidents (like violent crime) are injuries that fall within their remit. And yes, the act of shooting yourself either intentionally or accidentally is violent.I'm not claiming that it's not within their remit.  What I'm saying is that labelling suicides, accidents and homicides as violence is [equivocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivocation).Yes, shooting yourself is a violent act.  However when you tell someone "have you head about all the violence going on" they don't think "people killing themselves" they think violent crimes.  Pretending the two are the same is dishonest.  Pretending that suicide, accidents, and homicides are all the same simply because a gun is involved is extremely dishonest - they certainly don't have the same treatment path or prevention methods.The point I am making is that when you call suicides "gun violence" you are doing so deliberately in order to scare people.  You wouldn't call motor vehicle accidents "car violence" despite the violent nature of thousands of pounds of metal and plastic smashing together in an orgy of destruction, right?  If someone said to you, "we have to do something about this car violence" and then you found out that they were referring to fender benders, you'd think they were crazy.	0.0

&gt; You could argue TCU would've done the same thing had they been in the playoff instead of OSU.You could, but you would have absolutely no evidence to back up your argument. The fact is, TCU did not beat any great teams this year. Their best win (and only win against a team who was ranked at the end of the season) was against an Ole Miss team who ended the season losing 4 out of their last 6 and were ranked #17 in the final poll... with many people feeling that they were still ranked too high.The Buckeyes, on the other hand, beat the teams ranked #2, #4, #5, and #13 in the final poll.If Marshall had gone undefeated, would they have gotten in? No, because none of their wins were noteworthy. For better or for worse, TCU squandered their only chance to notch an impressive win- and you NEED to have (at least) one of those to legitimately insert yourself into this conversation.	0.0

Just curious, because I was wondering if big ships can be dismantled like the little ones, or if they will take damage but never lose chunks until the whole thing explodes.	0.0

&gt; Why don´t you just ask her?LOL! Sometimes the simplest, most obvious answers are the greatest. I somewhat embarrassedly admit that I hadn't thought of this. I will try and remember to try this next time I become lucid in her presence. I sort of suspect she won't give a very straightforward response, as she often doesn't answer my questions. She seems to shy away from direct verbal communication, and so a lot of our relationship is emotional, expressed with facial expressions and a sort of emotional 'vibe' that is communicated through facial expression and body posture in a way that feels somewhat more powerful than in real life.&gt; So awesome, i want dreams like that...I recommend dream journaling. It's what everyone here seems to say to do, and I've gotta tell you, it has worked pretty well for me. When I was starting out, I would often awake with almost no recollection of what I'd been dreaming. The key to getting started for me was to notice those moments shortly after awakening when some perception or thought triggers a memory from the dream. When this happens. I start writing it down, then follow the memory like a trail in my visuo-spatial imagination, walking backward and forward in my mind's eye through the dream, re-recalling each connected piece. The dream journals are thus a sort of pseudo-grammatical English walk through the sensations and perceptions of my dream, written down as I recall them using the previuosly written pieces.As I did this regularly, it became easier to remember dreams.As for dream vividity, I think that the most important factor in developing that was lucidity. Usually, right after I become lucid the first thing I do is look around and observe how detailed the surroundings are. At first, they might not be very detailed, but as I examine closer, the details are suddenly there. The more aware I try to be, it seems, the more realistic imagery I see.	0.0

Seconding what the others have said - DON'T TOUCH, and see a derm! However, a bit of background beyond that...I just started getting cysts two months ago, too - also for the first time in my life. Due to my age (27) and the cysts' location, I was also told they're hormonal. OK, thanks for that...so what?There are obviously medical ways to control your hormones, either through birth control (nightmare for me) or Spironolactone, which you can research (and the derm can prescribe). I wanted to avoid taking medication until I'd tried everything else. The below is working for me...Try evaluating your diet and cutting out foods that can elevate your testosterone levels: Soy in all its forms, iodines (seaweed, kelp, etc), dairy (milk and cheese), peanuts/peanut butter. That has really helped. I've also cut out all liquid makeup, including tinted moisturizer. By design, it's supposed to get into your pores so it looks as natural as possible - not great for acne-prone skin.If that doesn't help, take it one step further and evaluate the ingredients of everything you're using in your routine. I am sure you have been using this routine since before your skin turned on you, but if pregnancy has changed your hormones and your skin, there might be some stuff in there that's going to irritate you going forward.	0.0

| Even if one does not know about a particular man a, doesn't the universal quantification still express a conjunction of singular propositions including one about man a?That seems to be the case, but it seems like your professor thinks that for any proposition, it being *believed*(or known) by those expressing it is a genuine property of the proposition, and that this property should cohere with whatever view about propositions we happen to have.   Presumably, the general proposition "All men are mortal" is believed by whoever is expressing it(lets just say its a genuine expression).  But if general propositions just are collections of singular propositions(the view your professor disagrees with), it seems that one would also need to believe all of the singular propositions contained in "all men are mortal", but people meaningfully express "all men are mortal" perfectly fine without believing in all of its conjuncts(in fact, no one believes all of the conjuncts of "all men are mortal", because no one knows all the individual men)./u/gottabequick has brought up uncountable sets, but there might also be issues with propositions that refer to non-existent entities.  "all unicorns have horns" can be meaningfully expressed in some sense, but whatever the sense is, it doesn't seem to commit us to any existential claim about any particular unicorn.	0.0

I checked my watch. Five in the afternoon. Quitting time. I started packing up my things, slipping my laptop and charging cable into my messenger bag. A brown paper bag caught my eye. My lunch. Strange. Normally I had devoured it before noon even rolled around. Today I must have just been really buried in my work. I pulled it out and slipped the wrap I made out of its plastic. I took a bite experimentally. I frowned. Still no desire to eat. I resealed the plastic and put the bag back in my messenger bag. As I left my cubicle, an excited cry exploded from a few rows over. My curiosity overruled my desire to be home and I took a detour to the exit.I found my coworker jabbering incoherently at his laptop screen. As I approached, he swung the screen to face me and simultaneously shoved a piece of paper in my face. It was a lottery ticket. The website that he had pulled up on his laptop confirmed that he had the winning numbers. I gave him a high-five. He had been playing the lottery as long as I had worked here. Hopefully he won enough to recoup his losses. Another co-worker sauntered up to us, smugly producing another winning ticket. They compared tickets. Definitely the same numbers. What a strange coincidence. I congratulated the two of them and left. That was enough excitement for the day.I stepped out of the building and crossed the parking lot. Something was off. It was brighter. More vibrant. I examined my surroundings, taking in the details that I looked at so much I stopped seeing. Yes. That was it. There seemed to be a very large number of very new cars in the parking lot. I was no car enthusiast but they all looked incredibly expensive. Far more expensive than my coworkers should be able to afford. At least without going severely into debt considering the majority of them already lived paycheck to paycheck. I walked past a hospital on my way to the bus stop. There seemed to be a lot of activity outside of it. People were laughing and crying. There were far too many balloons for the outside of a hospital. Some people had fallen to their knees and were deep in prayer. Others danced their way out of the hospital, beaming at everyone they passed. Strange.I took my usual seat on the bus, and as with everything else this afternoon, something was off. I thought for a moment, then turned to the lady who had sat beside me and chatted with me to and from work for the past few weeks. She seemed to have lost a noticeable amount of weight since this morning. She beamed at me, greeting me with far more energy than usual. I found her incredibly...compelling. I couldn't keep my eyes off of her, tracing the angles and curves of her features that I had never really noticed until today with my gaze and I found myself tongue-tied where usually our conversation would flow quite naturally. I nodded dumbly as she casually mentioned that she had no plans for the weekend, flicking her hair over a shoulder and batting her eyelashes. Was she flirting with me? I heard myself ask if she'd like to go hiking at a nearby national park since she had no plans. I wasn't much of a hiker and had given up on the dating scene a year ago after a nasty breakup from which I hadn't recovered yet. But this was a good decision, at least my gut told me it was as it did cartwheels and somersaults for the rest of the trip.I entered my apartment complex. There was a strange smell. It was oddly earthy. As I passed a door to the stairwell, I heard a whinny. I stopped and turned to face the door on my right. There it was again. Curiosity overrode my manners and I knocked on the door. A young girl, perhaps seven or eight opened the door. She looked like she was about to explode with joy. She asked if I wanted to come in and look at her horse. I looked past her and found myself staring into a pair of nostrils. I politely declined and continued my way up the stairs to my apartment.As I struggled with the keys, a man I had never seen before walked out of the unit adjacent to mine. Puzzled, I introduced myself and extended a hand. He stared at it and asked me if I recognized him. I did not. He proudly proclaimed that he was Michael. My ten year old neighbor. I looked at him in dumb shock. The resemblance was definitely there but the man before me looked well into his thirties. I excused myself as politely as possible and made my way inside my apartment.I checked my phone. No new messages as usual. I did my routine check of the app store to see if there were any new interesting games. A new app caught my eye. "Magical Genie". I scrolled through the reviews. The vast majority were positive claiming the app would grant any wish the user could think of. Must be a marketing ploy. Seemed sketchy. I closed the app store, though briefly about ordering food, and decided I wasn't hungry. Strange. I don't think I'd eaten anything today.	0.0

I really don't think so. How fast do you think people are driving? Couldn't be more than 200km/h. The longest stretch of "open speed" road is 200km. So the difference between 130km/h and 200km/h is about 20 minutes. If 20 minutes was really the difference between crashing from fatigue or not, then the crashes would be happening during the last 20 minutes of the journey - in towns and cities. Not on the fast section in the middle of nowhere. The fact that the fatalities are reduced on the fast section says it's not the reduced travel time that is saving lives, it's something else. As other people have said it's probably that at faster speeds drivers don't get bored.	0.0

Yeah. I thought I loved the girls I dated, but when I look back, it seems that the only thing I was doing was satisfying my sexual fantasies. I saw something interesting in porn and wanted to try it out with my gf. No wonder they felt used. I've noticed that most of the girls couldn't really pinpoint what was wrong, but apparently they got this eerie feeling. No wonder, if my sexuality was based on pixels and paper, how could I ever really connect with them? The only thing I was doing was projecting images in my mind and trying to live up to these images, instead of living life and enjoying intimacy.	0.0

Right. That was my first thought...what happens when you get a bunch of nerdy introverts (and as a nerdy introvert I mean that in the best possible way) together in a room, and a bunch of people ask them loaded, condescending and angry (if valid) questions? That might go slightly better than what we just listened to because there's the off chance that the nerds in my scenario have been trained to deal with it. edit: I'm not really defending their tone. It definitely wasn't the most professional thing I've ever heard. I just wasn't surprised...like, even slightly. edit 2: Oh, and they definitely could have been better prepared.

Cats are alright; **dogs are awesome**.  I'll prove it to you /u/hsm4ever7. 1. Walking a dog is a great way to get some fresh air and regular exercise, which is good for one' health. 2. Walking a dog is a great way to socialize with other dog owners and random dog lovers. Make some friends, get a date, etc. 3. Brushing a dog is actually a great way to bond with the dog which leads to a closer relationship.  4. Dogs are better *because* they aren't dignified. There's nothing as heart warming as a dog's prancing when its owner comes home. (Cats often don't even bother to say hello) 5. Dogs are loud, that's true. That's why they make good guard dogs; there's no such thing as a guard cat is there? 6. Dogs are very smart. They can be trained to help people in a variety of ways: guide dogs, dogs to help soldiers reduce PTSD symptoms, sniffer dogs, etc.I'd also like to counter some of your points regarding cats:* Cats can also be destructive - they like to knock things over and play around with clothes a lot.* It's not just dogs that get lost, cats also get lost. There are signs looking for a lost cat, Tuna, all over my neighbourhood right now. Obviously, I love dogs much more than cats. I hope I've convinced you why that's the case.	0.0

I once went to the grocery store to buy some milk I once went to the grocery store to buy some cow's milk, but when I opened it and consumed a fair bit, I thought to myself "hmm...this doesn't taste like cow's milk, it tastes like it's been mixed with an almond drink".So I sold everything, moved out to Western Australia, bought a farm and some cows and now I drink unfiltered cow's milk straight from the udder.I also sued the grocery chain for US$11,000,000 for false labelling and false advertising amongst other things.

I think its just that Discraft as a company is comfortable with where they are. They have a pretty large share of the ultimate market plus they've been around forever. They have their couple DG pros that stick with them(until recently), plus they have the Ace Race every year which is free publicity. The other newer companies (Trilogy, Prodigy, MVP, etc) all have to build their market share and audience from the ground up. They've done a very good job of it for the most part, but if they wanted to become successful they had to over-market to a degree. I mean just look at MVP/Axiom - their fanbase is as hype-y as it gets. Innova is as well, but that's probably because they release discs at the fastest clip. I mean I know I'm buying a Whale when it comes out even though its proooobably not too much different from my P2 or Nova. Discraft though kinda just do their thing. They release an Ace Race disc every year, maybe one other. I think they'll just keep chugging along until they fall behind Trilogy, which I think they eventually will (already  have? I don't know the numbers)I'm also sure if you talk to /u/3Wheel you'll get a pretty good dose of Discraft hype	0.0

Well, it honestly sounds like you're the one stereotyping here. I never said that there were no black people in the eighties. I said most of the culture was white-oriented, and Halliday would be more likely to be exposed to that. You're also making huge assumptions about the author's motivations, ridiculous leaps to ridiculous conclusions.You're also claiming that Wade's plan being withheld from the readers somehow ruins the work. Not so. There are only two other options for how to deal with this situation, explain the plan right off the bat and ruin a large section of the book, or switch the focus to someone else and have all the action offscreen. I think you would object to both of those. Also, would you say that Sherlock Holmes is bad writing?

A bit of a tangent, but... My 90s porn story involved getting a helpdesk call at the ISP I worked for to see why a user's email account wasn't working on their dialup connection. Turns out it was stuffed full of file attachments, and it was just taking a long time for him to download. We asked him if he wanted us to save the files out and he could grab them individually from the FTP site. He said yes. We thought maybe someone was messing with him, sending him unsolicited images to DOS his email... However, he knew they were coming."Hey, there's a lot of images in there - are you expecting those?"  "Yes. I need those"  About a hundred files, and based on the one file opened accidentally by a tech and the names of the files, all kiddie porn.At the time,  there was no precedent, but there was a trial, and this guy who was a civilian member of  the local police ended up with a 30 day jail term served on weekends. The guy who sent him the images was apparently an actual cop, but neither of them worked for the police after that.	0.0

Personally, I can forgive people who grow and change over the many years in the profession. Many people need common sense, unfortunately. If it's the best solution, I don't see why he wouldn't advise that over some off the wall creative thing that would only exist for the listeners entertainment. I didn't read the above as fat shaming at all. The guy blamed the girl for "turning" him into her "fat little friend," so that's what he was responding to.I guess you could see it as redpill if it was given just to men, but it's definitely not. In fact, more women seem to write/call in about men being suddenly uninterested in sex, probably because we all know men are "supposed" to be primed for sex 24/7 (a myth he dispels).I guess he just isn't your style, which is fine.

How far have you gotten as of this posting? I definitely understand where you are coming from as far as the writing is concerned: some of the characters have pretty uninspiring dialogue (for me Souda and TeruTeru are just plain awful) but I do believe that they spent more time on the situations in SDR2. Chapter 2, 4, and 5 specifically are all quite thrilling and I was never quite sure who the killer was until the trials rolled around. I also kind of feel like Monokuma's character was always meant to be a slapstick gig, but it was a bit overblown in the second iteration. What went from humorous yet chilling in the first game got sort of skewered with the addition of Monomi to the mix. Neither of the characters really has much of a presence and Monokuma isn't quite the menace he was made out to be in SDR1.	0.0

A couple of things: Kirkwall was not in any way the representation of "the BEST" of the Chantry. Even long before the Qunari arrived it was well known that Kirkwall was the worst possible place for mages and had the worst-maintained Circle. In fact, it was just an incredibly shitty city all around, and its shitty history predates the founding of the Andrastean Chantry. I mean, this is a place called the City of Chains that was known for its brutal treatment of slaves. The first thing you see when arriving at the place by sea is the Gallows.If you do your investigations you find all kinds of weird magical shit and disturbances in the Veil happening all over Kirkwall and in the surrounding areas, and it's theorized that this is because of Corypheus's influence since he was imprisoned nearby. It's a fact that even while asleep, his dreaming mind could reach out and influence other people, especially people who were attuned to the Fade like mages and anyone using lyrium. It's therefore likely that it was actually partially because of Corypheus that the messed-up events you describe happened, although the city was, as I said, already a bastion of injustice and suffering long before the Chantry arrived. No matter what the city was a representation of the worst of Thedas, and we have firsthand knowledge from many people that the Circles elsewhere were actually pretty nice.Second of all, you assume a whole lot about what is going on in the decade that transpires during DA2. That everyone is doing "NOTHING" - well, we don't really see what anyone does because the game fast-forwards over so much, but how do you know that everyone from Elthina to the Divine did "NOTHING" the whole time? Certainly they didn't make any huge sweeping changes but the only time we ever see Elthina doing nothing is during the scene at the beginning of Act 3, and there she didn't really do "NOTHING", she prevented a riot from happening.Finally, there is the claim that Anders did the "right thing". Terrorism and murder is never the answer. If Anders had killed Orsino or Meredith there might be some degree of retribution there for their complicity in the atrocities, but Elthina literally had nothing to do with the stuff happening in the Circle, blaming her for mages getting raped is like blaming the governor for what some cops are doing in some small town in the state. Elthina was actually the least responsible person in the whole scenario, and that was precisely the point - by picking someone who was truly innocent, Anders was removing the possibility of reconciliation. If he had, say, blown up Meredith, then the mages may have forgiven the templars for everything because the head conspirator was dead. He actually says this almost verbatim in the game, I don't see how you could have missed that. This is exactly the ideology of a terrorist, not to mention all of the other innocent people Anders murdered in the bombing who had nothing at all to do with any of this.It's not just despicable but frankly insane his motivation here, and that's a fact that's acknowledged even by the other mages who support Anders, including even Hawke if you are playing a mage Hawke that's pro-rebellion. For fuck's sake it's even acknowledged by Anders if he is a rival to you - he flat-out admits he is slowly losing his mind, has memory loss, and that Vengeance is taking over more frequently and he cannot stop him. What Anders did in fact was not just "the right thing", but also one of the worst things that could have happened for the mages, because he removed the ability to choose from the other mages. They could no longer attempt negotiation or compromise, they either had to join the rebellion or get killed, except in rare cases of mages with political power like Vivienne. For trying to help the mages as you claim, Anders likely killed way more innocent mages than all of the templars in the entire history of Kirkwall combined - this was a continent-spanning rebellion. Remember, Anders didn't just make it so that innocent mages were being hunted down by templars and seekers - he also forced mage to kill mage, as the Loyalist mages who didn't want war and were outvoted were forced to defend themselves from the rebels.The fact that you can say that a woman who was trying to maintain peace "had to go" is pretty disgusting. I mean, I supported the mage rebellion in both games and had a mage Warden that liberated the Circle in Ferelden, but I acknowledge that Anders was an insane murderer, as does... literally every single person in the Dragon Age universe, even Anders himself as he offers his neck to the sword.	0.0

Once upon a time, there lived three brothers. The oldest was the village's best fighter. The middle brother was the best hunter. But the youngest, whose name was Ivan, just loafed around all day next to the fire. One day, a witch started to harass the countryside.   The Czar decreed that whomever gets rid of the witch would get to marry his daughter.  The two oldest brothers, heard this and immediately set out.  After weeks passed with no word from his brothers,  Ivan became worried and decided to find out what happened to them.  Unfortunately, all his lazing about made him morbidly obese and Ivan got stuck the doorway. &#x200B;That's when the witch found him and magically turned him into a pile of pork buns. &#x200B;So try Baba Yaga's famous pork buns today!  &#x200B;You want them, Ivan them, too!"	1.0

Perhaps it is the commentary/editorial that comes with it?  Your political views are painfully well known.  You misuse the term neo-malthusian to portray others as holding views that they do not.  This is a flat out defamation.  You use the term incorrectly and in public."Neo-Malthusianism generally refers to people with the same basic concerns as Malthus, who advocate population control programs, to ensure resources for current and future populations.["2] -from wiki.Besides this insulting *faux pas* you also regularly misinterpret or completely misunderstand  those same posts you are bragging about putting up for us.  I think that you would do a lot of people a favour if you were a little more careful about what you post in support of your political viewpoint.  Reading it carefully beforehand is one way of doing this.  If I were you I would not trust some of the stuff you read while visiting your usual hangouts.

That seems to be a frustration due to a particular bad macro, which could just have easily come from a function, rather than being due to macros-in-general. Like this insane function:    (defn wcar      ([opts a]       (if (or (not (vector? a))               (&gt; (count a) 1))         (do something);; treat (wcar {} yada) and (wcar {} [yada]) the same         (do something else)))      ([opts a1 a2 &amp; rest]       (do something else))) ;; treat (wcar {} yada yada) like (wcar {} [yada yada])I've much more often been burned by special syntax in macros than by macros themselves (in particular, `catch` is not a defined symbol anywhere, it has meaning *only* in `try` forms, which means you can't generate `catch` clauses from within your own macro: this is totally an own-goal that IMO should be fixed; `try` should macroexpand its contents and then look for `catch`es.).	0.0

Hmm, I think one of my gay friends is using me (and my friends) as the accessory. I love to go shopping alone, but if he knows I'm going shopping, he comes along, using me as personal stylist. I did this once to help him with his poor sense of style. But now every time we're only looking for mens clothes. Even going for drinks ends up in shopping for him. I don't really like shopping tbh.Also, talks only about him, never asks about me or any of our friends.    Always loans ridiculous amounts of money and forget to pay them back.    Once, he even forgot to go the marriage of our friends.We always say: he's living in his own world. But maybe he's using us just to be a backdrop in his life?On a side note: I have a very diverse racial and LGBT friends group, so we don't have any 'token' whatevers. But the gays truly have it the hardest with fake friends. It's so sad to see them being disappointed by friendships that blew up because it was just fake.	0.0

I think the success of T&amp;E comes from people considering a top down view of their work, rather than the content of an individual skit or episode. Sort of like, "this is funny because this episode runs like a bad 90's public access channel" and not, "that particular sketch where they yell 'oh mama!!' over and over is comedic gold." I've watched almost every episode on AS, their stuff can be really hit or miss. But you could see how a critic of hipster, when viewing a single episode or highlight reel would say, "wow, now these guys are true artists." Their skits are better viewed as a body of work than individually, as opposed to SNL or something.Does that make them funnier or more artistic? I don't know.For other self aware humor, I'd check out what Michael Ian Black and friends did with Stella about a decade ago and The State with their show before that. Those are hilarious!	0.0

For demographic purposes, female checking in here:I say this a lot here, but I was at Comic Con, so I'll give you my take on who I saw there. I couldn't really tell how many of what group were at the panel since I was sitting near the back, but the line of questions was almost entirely female. Moreover, I was at the DISASTROUS Bryan Fuller Funko signing line struggling to get in (didn't make it, but that's another story entirely) and I saw mostly females in and around the line--although I did meet two lovely gentlemen I wish I had gained contact info from. The moral of the story? Based on the limited sample size of people attending Comic Con and tumblr's heavy involvement, I'd say that while there's no conclusive data on the gender demographic, I'd feel confident saying the most "dedicated" (or perhaps simply vocal) fans tend to be female.	0.0

Ohhh I see, that makes more sense now. I still think that's problematic though. Why should a team's division title guarantee it a spot in the playoffs, but not a higher seed than wild card teams? If you're going to allow a non division winning team a higher seed over a division winner based on record, the logic follows that *any* team with a better record than a division winner (e.g. the Eagles this season) should be getting into the playoffs instead of them. I think if you're going to use the division title as a trump card over record, you have to have it as a trump card for seeding too, or it doesn't make sense.	0.0

[Here](http://taurotrickster.tumblr.com/post/97078214988/confidence-mirror-spell-minor-glamour-type) is one I found for you, though it seems to focus more on self-perception than how others see you. Another idea is bath magic, which I'm particularly fond of for glamours. Just add herbs and essential oils to your bath that you associate with masculinity - perhaps citrus, rosemary, or pepper. Persimmon has a rather obscure correspondence with "changing sex" according to [this](http://www.themagickalcat.com/Articles.asp?ID=242) list, so that may be effective for you. If you don't have a bath, try [this](http://recreationalwitchcraft.tumblr.com/post/124352257058/diy-magical-shower-disks) recipe for dissolving shower disks! Good luck :)	0.0

That's not really dragging the SEC through the mud. Isn't it reasonable to say any division that goes 2-5 in bowl games after being touted as "the greatest division ever" by many pundits isn't everything it was hyped up to be? The having to go undefeated thing is ridiculous though. I'm not trying to rehash old arguments but to me that doesn't seem like it's dragging the SEC through the mud. Honestly, everyone is probably being a little over sensitive at this point. OSU fans (and B1G fans to a lesser degree) are probably hopping on this train because we have been shit on since 2007. SEC fans are probably being a little sensitive because they are used to being called the best and now any sort of criticism is seen as the worst thing ever.	0.0

Do you read up on things, or do you just parrot feminist propaganda 24/7?http://www.nownys.org/fathers_resp.htmlhttp://www.nownys.org/archives/leg_memos/oppose_a00330.htmlStop blindly following shit you hear. They blatantly use gendered language against fathers, AND they are for giving the child to the mother by default over split custody by default. Not giving the child to the primary caregiver over the second. &gt; Giving the child to the mom does not make more sense than giving both parents custody.And that is what the largest feminist organization in the US supports, and my original point that you argued against. And they are an example of the numerous feminist organization that fight against equality, and why many women are running from that term, and why it has become a dirty word. Thank you. Goodbye.	0.0

No way dude. I'm an anxious person. I've used psychedellics twice, and both times were hellish. Absolutely **hellish** . I'm talking it took me months of nightmares to recover. Even smoking weed makes me stiff as a board and tense up. You might want to say "You just need to sort out shit in your life" but that's total bullshit. I just get anxious, especially when I don't eat at any kind of predictable interval, which drug usage often screws with eating habits and appetite. If I did a ton of LSD, would I smash windows? No, I doubt it. But I could see myself panicking, running through a window, and jumping off of a high ledge to escape whatever terror I was fleeing, ending up dead. I could also see myself being so afraid of someone that I blew their brains out, no matter how comforting they were being. I'm not saying it *would* or *has* happened anything like that. But if , for instance, everything went wrong that night, and I used a large dosage, then who knows. I'm just offering a hypothetical worst case.Now, a different person, with a different personality but similarly strong reaction to psychedellics might go around smashing windows.	0.0

Allow me to interrupt, haha.There is actually one artist I really like that is "considered" Pop music, she makes basically what /u/RockyHeart is talking about. She isn't on the radio either, but she is world famous to people who like this type of music, and it is intentionally trying to sound Top40 mixed with 80s.[Grimes - Genesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FH-q0I1fJY) she producing all the music, sings everything, directs the video, she is basically making herself a product. I actually don't mind her. She isn't like Lady Gaga and all that crap who don't have 100% control of their work, which is why I respect her, and she also does "crate" digging and record sampling...etc in some of her stuff.30,000,000 views on that song, and I've never heard it played on the radio ever. She literally is trying to be electronic pop music and create a "pop" almost brand name but not have it actually be "popular". "Pop" music has sort of morphed into an electronic, repetitive loopy sound, obviously any genre can be considered pop music, but there is a music genre called "pop" and I would call this that.It's not the greatest sound, but I don't mind it, and I would 100% say it is intentional pop music, that is almost "underground".  I hate top 40 music, and this is trying to sound like it, but it's not Top40	0.0

Consecration? That's probably the last skill I'd think of with a ret pal nostalgia trip. Ret to me is about old-school Reckoning, Art of War, Seal of Blood, Avenging Wrath, and Hammer of Wrath.

Savings? To some extent, yes, but it depends.There is the possibility of a downgrade once you're older and don't need a large house. If, however, the house you have now is something similar to what you're going to live in for retirement, then I'd say no as that money is effectively locked up until you don't need a roof over your head (read as: dead).I personally find it easier to just remove the inflation adjusted house payments from my expected yearly cost of living in retirement and apply the 4%/25x rule to that.One thing extra payments are NOT savings for is an emergency fund, unless you have an [offset mortgage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offset_loan_%28finance%29) where the funds are readily available and offsetting interest. In that case, it's fine to consider it part of an emergency fund.	0.0

Sure, but there's a case both ways. It's not as clear cut "NRL doesn't need anything from fox" as some people are making out here. As /u/boyfromthebush manetions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nrl/comments/3hkqfl/lengthy_discussion_the_nrl_has_dropped_the_ball/cu8szwq?context=3), fox still has leverage in that the only other option the NRL hasn't blown off are streaming.Fox still has to come to the table with a decent deal to get NRL onboard, but they (presumably) know that there aren't many other options if the NRL tries to get too greedy.We shouldn't even be comparing $2.5billion anyway, considering the fact that the AFL deal goes a year longer.

Well, she'll divorce his arse right around then (maybe even a year or two before, just to lock him into child-support and use the kids as leverage to get the house, and half {or more} of whatever shit he's managed to acquire + some alimony for herself as the "homemaker") ... she's already planning that whole thing.If he doesn't ditch the bitch now, he's gonna be really screwed... *actually he's pretty much ALREADY screwed no matter what he does;* she set him a sweet trap and like the **IDIOT** that he is, he fell right into it, all the way.	0.0

A distinction needs to be made between homicides that take place in the "criminal underworld" by people who have histories of violence (which is the majority -- the victims tend to be criminals as well) and homicide in the "normal" world.  The stats must be different, and motive a more relevant and trickier issue.I did find this quote interesting though:&gt;Men often kill over matters that appear to betrivial – minor insults or minimal physical contact – yet these challenges are viewed byparticipants as requiring a response in order to defend one’s masculinity. When a mankills his partner it is rarely out of mortal fear but usually in response to jealousy or othercontrol motive. But we all knew that! The general view seems to be if Adnan killed Hae, it was a jealousy/pride thing, if Jay did it... it must've been some kind of "criminal underworld" thing, because he barely knew Hae.  But why would Hae be involved in that sort of thing?Mulling this over pushed me over the line to the "Adnan is guilty" camp.	0.0

Same thing applies to Evolve. All maps are free and you can play together or against Hunters and Monsters you don't own. You can even play them yourself from time to time if you happen to take over a bot. So why are we complaining about Evolve's DLC again? I do agree the pricing is way off and needs to be cheaper, but here's an idea: don't buy the DLC then! It's a simple concept. If you don't like the DLC, you simply don't buy it or just wait until it's cheaper.	0.0

&gt; So he never gives any calculations for the energy of the plane hitting the building. Thought that would have been something that was pretty obvious.You don't realize how silly that statement is do you? To begin with the impact of the aircrafts doesn't factor into a study of the energy released in a gravitational collapse of the structure. The added weight of the aircraft would be completely inconsequential. The author of the paper is supposing that the entire mass of the structure, if converted to kinetic energy through a gravitational collapse, is still not sufficient to produce the melting of the steel found at the base of the collapse.It's very simple and easy to understand. The chaos of the event couldn't be more irrelevant to these calculations. I would love to see a refutation of the numbers here. The beauty of this computational study is the exact point that went right over your head. Analyzing the collapse in this way DOES in fact treat it like a controlled experiment because with respect to gravity - it is. The variables are known (the mass of the structures) and the constant (gravity - 9.8m/s/s) is accepted. The melting point of the specific grade of steel used is known. These calculations are straight forward and can't be marginalized by someone like yourself since you obviously didn't understand what you just tried to read.Fail.	0.0

&gt; You know what the advantage for playing in a group is? Being able to kill things much quicker, that should be good enough.The main problem is that while the monsters get increased health, you also get to dish out additional debuffers and buffers which not only increase your damage but also decrease the damage you take. And monsters damage isn't increased in any ways, so there is no downside for playing in a group.In D2 there were multiple features that balanced out group play. Monsters got more health, Monsters dealt more damage and the loot was shared. I don't know how exactly the loot was changed per player in D2 but i assume that you would not get twice as much loot if you play with your friend. In D3 you practically get twice as much loot. Sure, this can be arguable because the items dropped for a barb won't help the monk much but you can also do a group of 4 monks for example.	0.0

This has been a topic of great rumination for me for years. Maybe even a decade. I've spent a lot of time thinking, talking, and writing about it, and have come to a particular conclusion. I believe in basic determinism in the way that you have described it, but there is one thing that humans do appear to have control over. That is perspective. In any given moment at any given time, we are only reacting. If I think back to any choice I've made or action I've taken, I can see that my choice or action was agency-less. Instead, it was a reaction I had based on previous experiences and held judgments combined to influence my reaction. In the same way a [Rube Goldberg machine] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY-EBSvUcY)  unfolds, so do we. After being popped out of the womb, we cycle through a continuous series of events in which we only nominally exist. We become parts of other people's Great Machines of Life without knowing it, we do things and put ourselves in situations without knowing it, and we soak up all of these experiences, both consciously and unconsciously. In any given moment we are required to react, and that reaction is based on all of these past experiences, none of which we chose, none of which we had agency over. But, in reacting, we must *interpret* these past experiences in a way that is useful for guiding us. It's done in a split second, based on a determined series of values and desired outcomes that we hold at our center. This series of values and desired outcomes is, in my theory of free will, what I refer to as perspective. In our peaceful moments, in those times when the demands of our Great Machines take a moment to allow us to reflect and breathe, we can edit our perspectives. We can take the time to rethink our root causes, ponder the actions and reactions we have been a part of, and try to reframe our understanding of all of it. In doing so, we can actually have a pre-planned, agency-full effect on our future actions. I think that this actually aligns with your more out-there understanding of our extra dimensional organ(s). If there is one, it is our ability to conceive of our lives and ourselves outside of the Great Machine. We are able to step back, and try to look at the whole picture. This meta-cognition appears to allow us a certain level of disconnection from what is commonly referred to as reality (I believe that reality is that which does not stop existing once we stop believing in it). Feasibly, this ability to "disconnect" would be extra dimensional. We are, in fact, stepping out of the four main dimensions (the fourth being time), and able to conceive of the whole. This, and only this, is where I find there to be free will.	0.0

I started to send this in a private message because I knew it would get wordy and rambling and partially has to do with my own personal beliefs, which are personal, but I thought maybe it could be helpful to anyone else feeling the same way. I'd like us to reconsider the word "Black." And not in the way that this society tells us to, with the negative connotations that a non-Black people have put on it, but the concept of Black itself.But before I get into that, I want to share something my mother always taught me. I want to use the examples she uses to make the point. (1) she once knew a person with two different colored eyes. This person was very proud of this feature, held his head high, engaged people, enjoyed any attention it got and talking about how it happens. This guy confided in her once that he had met a woman once with the same genetic quirk. She was withdrawn, wouldn't look people in the eye, had poor self-esteem, felt ugly and freakish. The difference between them was that the man's mother had, from birth, told him about how wonderful and special and unique that feature was. Whereas the woman's had made her feel it was a defect, that it was ugly, to avoid showing people, that no one would like her, and so she grew up constantly trying to hide it and feeling as if something was wrong with her. Now, I'm sure people had teased and tried to put down the first guy about it during his lifetime, but he had that foundation of being proud of it before anyone else could plant another idea in there, and so he was able to weather it and come through with his head high. [Example 2] One time, my mother was explaining to me why she had insisted on making my first period such a fantastic &amp; celebratory experience. She said that one of her friends, in explaining the onset of puberty to her daughter, told her that it was awful, stressed how it was going to hurt, and that it was just a horrible thing that every woman goes through and she would have to just learn to suffer through it. That daughter is in her 40s now - almost old enough to be done with it. To this day, she still cries when she knows her period is coming, she dreads it every single time and feels horrified until it's over. [Example 3] My mother and her sister were born out of wedlock in the 50s. They were raised by their grandmother, who always told them they were wonderful and unique and special children because their parents loved each other so much that each of them was a "love child." They always were proud of that and held their heads high, thinking how fantastic they were. Then one day as a teenager, she heard "Love Child" by the Supremes. She was absolutely flabbergasted at that perspective of it; as something to be ashamed of. But even when she found out that society at that time considered that to be a shameful thing, she never internalized it because her foundation was in the positivity.So my point here is obvious, regarding being Black. Don't let society be the first one to explain to your child what being Black means. Embrace it, love it, show how absolutely blessed she is to be among those considered Black, and she will have the ability to deflect any other message, even if it gets hard sometimes. (See: Uzo Aduba's story about her full name, Uzoamaka) To a child, Mother is God. She answers the prayers/wants/needs, she is the giver of the law. While you hold that role in her mind, what you say to and about her will be accepted as truth. By the time she's old enough to figure out you don't know everything, she'll already have the foundation in loving her own Blackness.Moving on: Black vs. African. Personally, I have no argument with you if you want to be considered African, but I can see where actual African-born people might take issue, if you have no foundation in the cultures, languages, etc. of Africa. Like it or not, most of us are so far removed from those cultures that it's a little weird calling ourselves that now. I don't even like African-American, really. I'm proud to be a descendant from that land, but I can't realistically claim much of Africa myself. Even though I can trace at least one ancestor directly to Ethiopia/Sudan, I know really nothing about it. But I believe that in being taken from all parts and mixed so thoroughly during the Maafa, we should have the right to claim all of Africa as our ancestral home if we want to. I don't plan to show up and start demanding tracts of land I have no right to, but I know there are programs that offer it to us, and I think plenty of us should take them up on it.So what is my argument for the term "Black"? Well, I was always taught that all things in the universe and creation come from Black - the blackness of space, the dark matter from which sparks of energy originate, the blackness of the soil from which all things grow, the blackness of the womb that brings forth new life. I was taught that the Black Man and Woman were the original people of this planet. Not just of the continent of Africa - the entire planet. All people of all races and lands originated from Black, regardless of how they appear now. So in identifying with "Black", I personally feel that I am identifying myself with the origins of the universe and humanity. Africa is a continent, but Black is universal.I recall reading an article a few years ago - I keep looking for it and haven't found it again, goshdarnint - where the author was exploring which was the 'right' term to use, Black or African-American. He made the case for both terms, but one thing that caught my attention was that he pointed out that in some African traditions (despite current opinion that they wouldn't have made the distinction because *everyone* was Black) the people did, in fact, refer to themselves as Black. This was because in those particular traditions, Black was the term for the people, but also for God and creation. So in essence, in calling themselves Black, they were again connecting themselves spiritually with the source of all creation. I really wish I could find that article again. I always preferred Black but I felt that that was a really good validation for that choice.So my TL;DR is this: Call yourself whichever you like. But don't let white opinions dictate how you feel about being (or being called) Black. Those who are not a thing will find a way to make that thing seem undesirable, but just because we're raised in their culture doesn't mean we have to absorb their definitions. And whichever you choose to use, be sure to tell and show your daughter in every way possible, why it is SO COMPLETELY AWESOME to be that. Any stories, poetry, history, heroes, art, books (for pete's sake, try to minimize the TV, and if you must have it, look for carefully chosen programs vetted by you that do not marginalize or disappear or villainize Black or darkly-colorized characters, and avoid anything with commercials), you can get your hands on, use it. Compliment the beauty of brown/black in her skin and hair whenever possible. Point out everything beautiful and fantastic, and strong about her. It's a struggle raising Black children to have high self-esteem in their own Blackness in a white supremacist society, but it can be done. Don't internalize any negativity, don't allow it anywhere around you for as long as you can possibly control it. That way, by the time she eventually encounters it (and she will, if this society continues going on this way - [obligatory plug for #JusticeOrElse](http://justiceorelse,com) because we should not, under any circumstances let that happen), she will be so grounded in love for who she is and where she comes from that she'll be able to weather that storm with her sense of self intact. And that's my $2.22.	0.0

I used to have a trashcan in my bathroom - a nice one, too, with a brushed steel finish and a removable interior plastic compartment for easy emptying. Could you believe that my then-girlfriend disposed of, uh, *sanitary products* in there?I had to toss out the trashcan itself, and shortly thereafter realised that the offending girlfriend herself was a destroyer of things, and not someone whose wrath I wished to incur again. Since then I have been without both a girlfriend and a bathroom trashcan. I have to walk to the kitchen to dispose of q-tips now, but otherwise all is more or less in order.	0.0

I'm not sure I'm understanding why having two different research XP pools would be helpful. Furthermore, I do not think that removing the grind entirely for premium users is a good idea at all. Part of the grind is learning to play each ship and progressing along. For the most part, each new tier brings newer challenges and responsibilities to the player. Additionally, without a grind, players would experience burnout very quickly. The grind for premium is abridged, but not so much so that it's rushed. I will get to Tier 10 on my selected lines faster....but not to the point I'm practically done playing before you even get here, ya know?The business model is honestly pretty solid and fair. Sure, we may not be fans of some of their sales and marketing tactics, but the core model (Free to play, but pay to make things a little less painful grind wise) is pretty solid.	0.0

Are my testicles black?  A male patient is lying in bed in the hospital, wearing an oxygen mask over his mouth and nose. A young student nurse appears to give him a partial sponge bath."Nurse,"' he mumbles from behind the mask, "are my testicles black?"Embarrassed, the young nurse replies, "I don't know, Sir. I'm only here to wash your upper body and feet."He struggles to ask again, "Nurse, please check for me. Are my testicles black?"Concerned that he might elevate his blood pressure and heart rate from worrying about his testicles, she overcomes her embarrassment and pulls back the covers. She raises his gown, holds his manhood in one hand and his testicles in the other. She looks very closely and says, "There's nothing wrong with them, Sir. They look fine."The man slowly pulls off his oxygen mask, smiles at her, and says very slowly, "Thank you very much. That was wonderful. Now listen very, very closely: Are - my - test - results - back?"Update: adding space.	1.0

Providing you don't skip highlighting, dark colour schemes work well. You can't have all-dark colours because you'd lose details visually, but if you do a little highlighting you retain it.As for colour choices, avoid using pure black. Just as a colour theory thing, you can't get shadows on black. You should definitly prime black for this colour scheme, but black should not be your basecoat. Since that colour scheme looks very dark brown I'd recommend that you have a look at Games Workshop's *Rhinox Hide* as the base paint, followed by a wash (or two, depending on how dark you want it to be) of *Nuln Oil* followed by cleaning up with a thinned down layer of *Rhinox Hide* with a final highlight in something like *Gorthor Brown* or *Doombull Brown* depending on how strong you want the brown colour to be.From there, you'd want to start applying the green feathering to the carapace, and that's done in steps as well, you basically draw lines along the edges of the carapace plates along with a traditional edge highlight... there are a few guides online how to do this, and Games Workshop has [a painting tutorial on Tyranids that covers the concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;list=PLEaPE4sLDA7s-26V0v6SepDFiznb3y6hx&amp;v=PJaW_rQIS_s#t=454). The darkest green you'd want to look at is probably *Castellan Green*, followed by highlighting the lines with either *Warpstone Glow* or *Warboss Green*. From there you could add another highlight with *Skarsnik Green*, and it looks like on the very tips of some details there's a little bit of tan highlighting so you could probably use *Ushabti Bone*. If you want to shade on top of that, you'd probably want to go with *Athonian Camoshade*.Lastly, with the bone details that's pretty straight forward *Zandri Dust* basecoat -&gt; some sort of shade, such as *Nuln Oil* (for dark black recesses) or *Seaphim Sepia* (for rich brown recesses) -&gt; a thinned layer of *Zandri Dust* to clean up the flat surfaces -&gt; *Ushabti Bone* highlight -&gt; *Screaming Skull* final highlight. That's how I'd tackle that colour scheme, in theory anyway. you should go and inspect those paints in person (I don't have most of those paints, truth be told) and see if they reflect the colours in your images.	0.0

&gt;But Alphabet's subsidiaries are all businesses that will produce revenue that will feed into the parent. Self driving cars, drone delivery service, medical technology, Android, plus Google search, maps, wallet, and it's organization of the web.None of Aphabet's subsidiaries are profitable other than Google though. &gt;If Google disappeared today, what would Internet users have? Bing, Mapquest, Apple, and Paypal, all of which are 4 companies doing the job of one, and not at the same level of quality.The point isn't that it's going to disappear today. The point is that over the next 5-10 years, if "personal assistants" like IBM's Watson continue to advance at their current rate, people will significantly reduce their use of traditional internet search - which will cripple Google's profits. They have restructured like this because they see where the future is going, and know they either have to a) destroy their existing business to compete with new entrants (otherwise known as the innovator's dilemma), or b) ride their profits hard until they can't compete (otherwise known as Blockbuster). Within 10 years "Google" will either be a small old, lowly profitable part of Alphabet, or Alphabet will be hocked off for parts and will cease to exist.	0.0

I've been to several Roos and I'm pretty puzzled by this. Usually, I like the thought that some of the headliners could do guest spots elsewhere. Kendrick isn't ready for that spot. One album out and this follows a really flat performance in 2013. Unless there are a ton of other rappers out there, or he brings guests, this is going to be a short headliner. Mumford? Meh. I've seen them. Solid show, but kind of a snoozefest. Considering by the time they come back around for the roo, its going to be 21 months since their last show. Billy Joel is a legend. Great performer. Check out the Shea Stadium shows he did a few years back. I'm just kind of puzzled why they would bring his set there. I'm still going regardless.

An important topic.I read a book of abnormal psychology that I found in the local university's library. There was a description of BPD and it sounded quite biased. BPD patients were described as one of the hardest patients to deal with and that their hospitalizations are merely vacations for them. If the students studying mental health issues study descriptions like these, no wonder they're already prejudiced when they step into actual working life. Plus it was "an entry level" book; I don't think it's that bad to take different voices into account when you've already studied for, say, 3-4 years. But presenting biased information in the entry level courses - that can leave a long-lasting mark in the student's mind.It's one thing to tell facts regarding the disorder and another thing to spout gut feelings about the disordered people. I think it's better to stay no-nonsense. The book appeared to be quite old though (from the 80's or 90's?), hopefully the descriptions are nowadays more respectful.	0.0

I made a long post excoriating you for all of the instances of selfishness, minimization of you own actions, disregard and dismissal of your SO's feelings, justification, and self-righteousness in your OP. I deleted it because it is not my style, but I felt the need to let you know because I feel like you may have some bigger issues here to deal with than opening up (narcissism?).I have forgiven cheating in both mono and poly relationships, and I am the last person to demand that cheating be a all-circumstances dealbreaker. I originally asked for clarification because I was shocked how you were describing the experience (e.g. "MY patience and openness", "I NEEDED that experience"), and I thought you guys weren't exclusive and I was misunderstanding.This is not about WHAT you did, but rather HOW you are describing the experiences, even now. I don't know the whole story obviously, and I may be reading too much into it, projecting, etc., I have to admit that. But I find your post in its entirety extremely troubling.	0.0

As an intensely private person, something like your situation would probably be enough to make me file for divorce almost immediately.  Trust is a big thing, especially for those who don't trust easily.  It can take a long time to earn and a short time to lose.  Also, I wouldn't even be friends with a person like your wife.  If she can't even keep her husband's confidences it's doubtful she would be able to keep a friend's confidences.  I choose to distance myself from those kinds of people.  They don't make it very far into my life.I also think your wife has boundary issues.  Who discusses their personal life in such depth with co-workers?  I get that people develop friendships with co-workers, but there are lines.  I think she's asking for trouble at some point, like if she's ever on the outs with one of the co-workers she's spilled her secrets to.	0.0

Sorry, did someone mention the Senate?&gt;“Scientific evidence overwhelmingly indicates that cannabis is substantially less harmful than alcohol and should be treated not as a criminal issue but as a social and public health issue”, said Senator Pierre Claude Nolin, Chair of the Special Committee, in a news conference today in Ottawa.  “Indeed, domestic and international experts and Canadians from every walk of life told us loud and clear that we should not be imposing criminal records on users or unduly prohibiting personal use of cannabis.  At the same time, make no mistake, we are not endorsing cannabis use for recreational consumption.  Whether or not an individual uses marijuana should be a personal choice that is not subject to criminal penalties.  But we have come to the conclusion that, as a drug, it should be regulated by the State much as we do for wine and beer, hence our preference for legalization over decriminalization.”From: *The Special Senate Committee on Illegal Drugs News Release, Sept 2002.*Link: http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/SEN/Committee/371/ille/press/04sep02-e.htmJust in case anyone harbored any confusion about the usefulness of the Senate as part of our legislative process.

&gt;Most of the sacrificial rituals took more than two people to perform. In the usual procedure of the ritual, the sacrifice would be taken to the top of the temple.[35] The sacrifice would then be laid on a stone slab by four priests, and his/her abdomen would be sliced open by a fifth priest with a ceremonial knife made of flint. The cut was made in the abdomen and went through the diaphragm. The priest would grab the heart and tear it out, still beating. It would be placed in a bowl held by a statue of the honored god, and the body thrown down the temple's stairs.[36] The body would land on a terrace at the base of the pyramid called an apetlatl /aˈpet͡ɬat͡ɬ/.[34]&gt;The body parts would then be disposed of: the viscera fed the animals in the zoo; the bleeding head was placed on display in the tzompantli, meaning 'hairy skulls'.[37] Not all the skulls in the tzompantlis were victims of sacrifice. In the Anales de Tlatelolco it is described that during the siege of Tlatelolco by the Spaniards, the Tlatelolcas built three tzompantli: two for their own dead and one for the fallen conquerors, including two severed heads of horses.&gt;Other kinds of human sacrifice, which paid tribute to various deities, approached the victims differently. The victim could be shot with arrows (in which the draining blood represented the cool rains of spring); die in unequal fighting (gladiatorial sacrifice) or be sacrificed as a result of the Mesoamerican ballgame; burned (to honor the fire god); flayed after being sacrificed (to honor Xipe Totec, "Our Lord The Flayed One"), or drowned.[38]from [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sacrifice_in_Aztec_culture#The_sacrifice_ritual)&gt;Human sacrifice was practised to some extent by many peoples in Mesoamerica (and for that matter, around the world) for many centuries.  But it was the Aztec empire that really took the ritual to new heights.  How many people were sacrificed by the Aztecs?  We don't know how many were sacrificed over the years - it's possible that some accounts are exaggerated - but it was probably thousands each year - tens of thousands or more all together.  Some estimates claim 20,000 a year.from  [here](http://www.aztec-history.com/aztec-sacrifice.html)	0.0

Preface, you definitely cannot use Nikon Commander Mode with a Canon speedlight. That doesn't mean you cant trigger it though.A) Use a 'dumb' sync cable. Center pin to fire only. This will work no problem.B) Use a 'dumb' wireless trigger, such as a pocket wizard or similar. This is only using the center pin to fire, so again, no problem.C) get an optical slave trigger for the 580EXII - they're tiny little pc-sync bugs that you can just attach to the flash. For some stupid reason Canon decided against building this in? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ This won't take advantage of your Nikon 'commander mode' though.Check out [FlashZebra](http://www.flashzebra.com/opticalslaves/index.shtml) for the optical slave addons.

police are not judge, jury and executioners. they can't kill someone for not listening to them. the police also have to obey their own rules. they are not above the law. &gt; How about, don't break the law? if you're such a strong proponent of following the law, then you should be a strong supporter of people who are trying to reform the overhanded response of today's police. few people will say that the police have an easy job. however, one of the main components of their job is to interact with the public. these interactions will not always go smoothly, but the police are bound by the law as much as any other citizen. they do not have the legal right to kill someone for disobedience. at no time was Eric Garner a threat to the lives of any of the officers surrounding him. a lethal response, such as a chokehold, should be reserved for lethal situations.	0.0

Himalayas Walt Disnay [P]Seychelles The Shovel Knight [P]The warrior from the Seychelles enters the Colosseum. Clad in cloth, one could see his massive arms, more akin to a beast than a man, wielding his weapon of death. Clutched in his ape like hands, a glorious shovel, forged perhaps from the fires of Hades itself. The edge seemed to cut the very air. This landscaper, this holder of the Shovel Throne, was known simply as The Shovel Knight, master of Shovel Fu, and conqueror of all.Facing the Shovel Knight, a mythological, legendary man. Feared by the forces of Nature and Heaven Above, he sauntered into the arena. The arms of the Shovel Knight were big, yes, but this man had muscles to rival Zeus himself. He had survived everything the universe could throw at him, and he smirked at the man opposite him. "Fuck off!" He yelled, as he hefted his weapon of war at the ready; a giant, five year old child sized, red lollipop shaped axe. Sharpened across the circumference, with the face of Walt Disnay himself painted in beautiful replication in the center, it was a weapon for the ages.The arena was on edge, as the Shovel Knight and Disnay began. A matchup to rival any in the Augustan, with endless speculation, it began. Walt, caught in a reverie, wondering how his tamed Yeti was doing without him, and not really that concerned about the yard worker posing as a warrior, was almost hit unaware.The Knight, in a blur, had scooped up a shovel full of sand, and quick as lightning, hurled it at Disnay.But, amazed, he watched it deflected, as Walt spun the Lollipop Axe in a stunning circle of protection, not one grain of sand getting through. "H .. how?" asked the Knight, having counted on his quickness and speed to destroy this champion quickly."Fuck your sand!" screamed Disnay, with a snarl, as he hurled his cancer ridden body at the Shovel Knight.The Dragon King impacted the man before he could step, sending them both to the sand. Screaming obscenities, he drove the Lollipop Axe into the throat of the Knight, cutting off his head, which he then flung into the stands."Fuck that shit!" he spit at the body, as he got up and left the Arena, muttering about building a new Lamborghini.	0.0

For some people, "close" can mean seeing each other on big holidays, occasional family dinners, sometimes something socially. For others, it means weekly, or even daily, interactions. Your parents very deliberately cut themselves away from that side of the family, leaving some very sparse connections. The invitation to your parents? That wasn't a mistake. Your cousin likely saw them as rarely being around, never available, and wanted to not have them as a part of the wedding. If you want to be more involved with your extended family, reach out. Put aside hurt feelings from the wedding, and find a cousin other than the recently married one, and ask for some time to talk. Lay it out that you want to be a part of the family, and try to get some idea of what family means to *them* rather than yourself. It will likely be pretty eye-opening.	0.0

&gt; but the fact of the matter is, 200 years from now, people will know of The Godfather, whereas the same cannot be said for TLOU.That's a very, VERY easy claim to make, given the inability to back this up either way. How about you give me, without looking up on google, a single movie from 1910?Point being, TLOU not being remembered 200 years from now does not take away from its significance or quality today. There exist movies, plays, and books that, back in their day, were probably instrumental to the development of film, theater, and literature, but which are unknown to us today.Plus, before and right after release, there were people saying TLOU would be a fart in the wind. And yet, here we are, more than 2 years later, still constantly talking about it.&gt; In fact, the top 10 video games of all time couldn't stand up to the top 100 films of the same class. Ranking movies or games is inherently subjective. Given that both mediums are really quite different from one another, it's also inherently useless to try to interchangeably rank them. Not to mention that, once again, and despite the fact that you seem to be acknowledging it in the first sentence of your post, you simply can not compare a 140 year old medium to a 40-ish year old. Meaning, you can not take a movie that has 100 years of iteration as its foundation, and compare it to a video game that really only started iterating on the concepts it employs a decade ago, with Uncharted 1.	0.0
If the saying predates the toy, then my guess is that the toy derives from the saying.Anyway, as a Californian, I would say that the phrase is not common here. Actually, I can't honestly say that I've ever heard of it at all. But...to not know what the phrase means at all seems strange. If someone uses an idiom like, "You are more _adjective_ than a _noun_," isn't the obvious implication that _adjective_ describes you well? I don't even know what there is to ask your friend about.	0.0

A scumbag, surely, I was just playfully replying to the cop-apologist guy above, Like if cops gain a reputation for killing indiscriminately and behaving like above-the-law thugs, then it seems inevitable that people are going to have little trust in them, and even in trivial situations, like marijuana possession, people might think it's best to do whatever they can to prevent themselves from being victimized by a corrupt and unaccountable police force. Surely not what happened here, but still, if you don't keep the police accountable for their behavior, then doesn't it seem plausible that such situations will be generated, and with greater frequency?

Radical liberals are the most irrational fuck-wits on the planet. They're far worse then the religious-right ever was when it comes to bullshit moral crusades and thought policing. At least Christianity has some concept of forgiveness, if you cross the line on some left issue (racism, sexism, etc) you'll wish there was a god just so there'd be something to help you. Not fond of the idea of "original sin", how about white privilege or the patriarchy instead. The attitudes and behavior taken by liberals mirrors religious fervor in an uncanny way. It's like you can't escape the systems of social control, just put different costumes on them. Try suggesting that single parent-homes are detrimental to child development, or that a lot of poor people bear some responsibility for their situation to a liberal. Then compare that reaction to the one you get when you suggest that gay people should have the same rights to marry as straight people to a conservative. Not to mention the idealism without any practicality among liberals. Hey let's bury the entire country in mind-boggling debt because everyone deserves EVERYTHING for nothing, and it's not like you actually have to pay for things the government gives out right? That's rational.	0.0

The #8 is for Ian Wright, actually. I understand the article, I am commenting on the fact that we're always in the social media and articles and praising each other to high heaven, yet we bottle it on the pitch. We finished the season tremendously, with b2b FA Cups and Community Shields, a promising pre-season, then get smacked by WHU at home on day one. We've made no improvements over the summer, Alexis has been rushed back, Wilshere is injured again, Ramsey is trying too hard to replicate the other season, Ozil needs to shoot more, Chamberlain doesn't even start, Theo pushed and pushed us to pay him a higher wage and we don't even start him either. Our DM is the only one we have, and when he's injured or booked, we're back to square one. We had every one back in June, now the season's started, we have 3 players out, 2 of them quite crucial given our formation. How does that even happen?But none of this matters as long as we say sorry on Twitter.	0.0

This happened years ago so we've had plenty of chances to joke about this over the years.    He was a new manager and wanted to show he was unbiased in his actions. Since I took off on a unscheduled day, for me,he was trying to show no favorites. Actually used the excuse I had no evidence I went to a funeral. My pointing out he was my excuse was not sufficient as no one else would be able to use that excuse in the future. He was just trying to bend over backwards to be super unbiased so the other employees would respect him more.    I got over it as realized over time he was just too young in his job to secure about his decisions. I got a better job but only because I called around to some of the other managers to see if they needed someone. I had dealt with a lot of them because I worked so often with other locations when they ran short on supplies.   So while it all worked out for me still was angry for a few months. Got over the anger the first time he called me to help cover a shift when he ran short on people. Just laughed and told him it sucks to fire good workers don't it? And no I didn't cover the shift for him.	0.0

Without even looking at your monsters; you need to 6* your monsters the stat increase from 5 stars to 6 stars is probably all you need to successfully progress in this game. You need to upgrade your 4* runes to 5/6* runes; you need to ensure all your monsters are using % Stats on 2/4/6.Use those crystals and buy a 1 day 2x card and take your best farmer and grind a scenario and level fodder and get Shannon and Bernard to 6*; swap Ahman for Bella and 6* him as well.5 6* monsters after a year of playing sounds like you played it quite poorly. I know everyone doesn't have unlimited time to play but you made a 6* monster every ~10 weeks.Even the F2P players can pump out a 6* monsters in 2-4 weeks. Post your box and if you don't have the right monsters this is one of the few times where I would say using crystals to summon wouldn't be a bad idea.Do you have a farmer, there is no right or wrong way to play but it looks like you skipped some important steps to make your gaming experience much better. Do you have a farmer? A Roaq / Lapis / Soha / Susano any monster that can farm a scenario quickly and effectively..The general progression regardless of pulls goes Farmer (Lapis/Roaq/Soha/Etc) &gt; Healer (Bella or Ahman) &gt; Wind duo Bernard/Shannon &gt; Immunity (Optional) &gt; Light Trio (The remaining ones Darion/Bella/Ahman) &gt; Any other Supports &gt; TOA (As far as you can go) &gt; Farm GB &gt; Upgrade runes &gt; Fusion (Baretta/Vero) &gt; Farm GB10 &gt; Complete TOA &gt; Farm DB &gt; Upgrade runes &gt; Farm DB10 &gt; Work on Arena &gt; Congratulations you've reached end-game.All while going through this you should be 6* units, Shannon, Bernard, Acasis, Bella, should all be 6*.	0.0

IMO composites and plastics are perfectly viable building materials for 3lbs and lighter bots (in fact full metal construction seems impractical for something that light).You have a choice to either use pre-made parts (tubes, rods and sheets) or to lay your own custom parts. I have no experience with the former, but in any case design for repairability. Hypershock used a CF monocoque and [suffered a catastrophic failure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JbF79cGc8I) in the fight vs icewave. IMO that's pretty much impossible to repair reliably without replacing the whole chassis. Talking specifically about CF, you have to keep in mind that it's only strong in the direction of the fiber. Sheets usually interleave perpendicular layers, but rods often just use fibers parallel to the length. I personally really dislike the failure mode of CF. It tends to bend a little and then it just snaps almost clean off (like Hypershock's chassis).Plastics on the other hand (polycarbonate, nylon, ABS) tend to flex a lot more before failure, which better deflects impacts and allows for graceful failure where parts suffer some plastic deformation but still hold together. With the availability and low cost of FDM 3D printers, it's my tool of choice for building small bots. Just avoid PLA for parts which might get in direct contact with spinners. You can also use sheets made from other materials (titanium, PC, CF, GRP) on the outside as armour.	0.0

&gt;Yes I did lolAh, that makes this easier then, I apologize for assuming you haven't.&gt; The anime makes flashy fights and in doing so makes characters stronger than in the novel imo. I don't think even in the anime you could say that's a sonic boom without some context around it since shockwaves could be either just effects to make fight look cool or magically based instead of physics based. This is wrong on so many levels. The anime makes the servants look way slower. The faster servants are at least mach 3 and the anime doesn't even come close to showing that. For example, the Archer vs. Lancer fight looks nothing like trading over 200 blows in seconds. Just because something looks flashy, or makes the fight look cool (I guess all explosions in fights don't mean anything huh) doesn't mean the feat is diminished. Either way a peak-human wouldn't be able to make shockwaves. &gt;So her a couple things, making his arm shake just means the attack was stronger not that it was stronger than archer, as in he was actually feeling the strikes. Did you post the wrong image, that one doesn't say unimaginable? Archer was always trying to kill thats just accurate flavor text, and then it does say he is able to now block and counter on archer but that's not exceeds in the sense he's hitting harder just a little rough translation saying he's not just on the defensive he's now able to get offensive. Like i definetly am sayimg his techniwue and strength exponentially improve as he fights archer but hes still not on their level. He was able to block there because the phantasms were doing the heavy lifting for him, he talks about in those fights how he blocks faster and better than he understands over and over and gets fucked up from the impacts of the swords and knows without them he'll get obliterated. I posted the wrong image at first and changed it. If Archer is feeling the strikes, the strength of the blow has to be near his current strength at that point. Shirou even repels a swing Archer made with all his might. Archer wasn't going for the kill at first, he was trying to break Shirou's spirit first. The Noble Phatasms are doing the heavy lifting yes, but they are also giving him the physicals to do what they want. Perfect tracing copies the stats of whoever's weapon their tracing along with the skill as seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/SfbsDnn.png).&gt;This all leaves alone what I said about the various ways archer is very weak in their fight and how Shirou doesn't get taken out of the fight immediately only because the sheath is healing him. Also the fight is much less even in the novel, Shirou can only keep going because archer stands still so Shirou needs to only stand up to keep fighting, of he moved Shirou would collapse even with the sheath. Shirou then only actually hits him, instead of losing with his strike, because archer let's him and that is explicitly said, then Shirou collapses. Finally, you have to admit, part of the reason Shirou is even able to do that much is as a kind of literary technique where their fight matches their ideals fighting so Shirou is kind powered by his determination and not his actual skill. I'm on mobile, can't. Grab the images but you sound like you know the novel well enough I mostly don't need them.Archer was weakened but you're ignoring how much Shirou was weakened and is on the verge of death. The fight is pretty much even near the end, tipping towards Shirou. His determination is fueling him but he's getting better at tracing and it allows his stats to get better near the end of the battle. The reason his stats weren't increased near the beginning, was because his projections were mere hollow illusions that took the shape and not the structure. Archer only needs to step back but that's not the point (it actually helps my point showing how fucked up Shirou was), he couldn't kill Shirou using offense at that point. Shirou hits him with the last strike because Archer let him but Archer couldn't hit Shirou either at that point. He was overwhelming Archer with speed and strength that Archer didn't expect. During the fight against Gilgamesh, Shirou was 100% healed, better at tracing and had mana amp from Tohsaka. Also, stop calling feats you don't like literary techniques or "flavor text", just because you don't think their plausible doesn't mean you can dismiss them.	0.0
