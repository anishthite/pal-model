Are my testicles black? A male patient is lying in bed in the hospital, wearing an oxygenmask over his mouth and nose. A young student nurse appears andgives him a partial sponge bath."Nurse,"' he mumbles from behind the mask, "are my testicles black?"Embarrassed, the young nurse replies, "I don't know, Sir. I'm onlyhere to wash your upper body and feet."He struggles to ask again, "Nurse, please check for me. Are mytesticles black?"Concerned that he might elevate his blood pressure and heart ratefrom worrying about his testicles, she overcomes her embarrassmentand pulls back the covers.She raises his gown, holds his manhood in one hand and his testiclesin the other.She looks very closely and says, "There's nothing wrong with them,Sir. They look fine."The man slowly pulls off his oxygen mask, smiles at her, and saysvery slowly, "Thank you very much. That was wonderful.

For me the answer is clearly: Angband &gt; Nethack. Maybe back in the very old days it was acceptable to make learning the game mechanics a part of the game (anyone remember "The Prisoner" for the Apple II+ ?) ...and that can still be fun if implemented properly, I guess... each to his own. But, I like to play a roguelike as a tactical dungeon expedition / assault. I like clearly defined corridors and the ability to set up kill zones and use magic &amp; ranged attacks in an unrestricted arc. Dipping things into potions or stealing things from stores doesn't appeal to me enough to bother with the bad UI and inferior maps.	0.0

The left is often defined in post-left text, however because of the influences  that make up the broad term "post-left anarchy" it is hidden somewhat in the flowery language, which is suppose to make you critically think and come to your own conclusions rather than lay out a road map or detailed theory. The whole basis of post-left anarchy IS individualist critical thinking.As to defining the left from a post-left anarchist perspective; The left wing of capital. Socialism and Capitalism are both based around The Means Of Production or MOP for short. Both systems are based around who owns the MOP. For capitalism, it is privitized, for socialism, it is socialized. Of course both are more complex, but this is a 101 answer. Socialism and its advocates, from a post-left anarchist perspective, are meerely just another side of the coin to the real problem: capital. Post-left anarchy is primarily influenced from individualist Anarchism, Situationism, and Communization. All 3 theories are anti-work, so the notion of owning the means of production is undesirable as work is misery.As for ideology, I personally define ideology as a fixed box of ideas, with no room for growth outside of the box, only internal. The box may get bigger, but it is still a box. Post-leftism, and now this is where the individualist anarchist thought comes in, rather advocates for a base foundation of ideas (anarchism) to grow from, like a tree of sorts and using critical thinking as a weapon and never staying intellectually stable. Always thinking about new ideas, never being held down by ideological constraints. Ideology is a trap.As for dogma; Judge individuals as individuals, not as ideological propegators. We all hate some ideologies such as Marxist Leninist, but rather than immediatly pushing away the individual solely because they hold dumb views, push away the individual because they're a shitty person for wanting to control the state. make sense? Merit and Ides, not one or the other.As for affirmation of gender being dumb and rather advocating for the negation of gender; When I say affirmation of gender I mean reinforcing its constraints wether as a binary, or as a spectrum as both create a line of existence for which to classify oneself as. Gender originates from division of labor, and division of labor originates from gender. Being against capital, we are naturally inclined to be against division of labor and classification of roles. Gender directly does this, ie masculine being productive labor and feminine being reproductive labor. Rather than affirm that I am genderqueer, i would much rather negate gender itself and the contraints it holds on myself. againstness of identity classification.As for anti-democracy; read [this essay](http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/moxie-marlinspike-and-windy-hart-audio-anarchy-radio-an-anarchist-critique-of-democracy) and [this essay](http://freedomnews.org.uk/democracy-is-already-direct-a-response-to-jon-bigger/)Finally on critiques of industry and technology; Not all post-left anarchist are primitivist, actually quite a few are. Post-civ thought is the most popular amongst the post-left miliue which someone from that train of thought should answer as I personally don't really get it/care for it.Actually finally; Yes of course post-leftism is anarchistic. Attack and rebellion against social order IS anarchistic in of itself wether that translates to everyone owning their own workplaces, or everyone burning them down. Anarchistic does not mean applied over existing institutions like a reform.	0.0

The problem is how one defines "winning". If low wages make our economy win, who is winning exactly?. A few people at the top, on the backs of all those at the bottom. I get the argument. Higher wages make companies outsource jobs. That's already happening, because our lowest wage is way more than other countries like India and China. Those that seek low wage workers who are not necessary to be located in the U.S. already do so.   Most low wage workers are in the service industry. Retail and fast food workers. They can't be outsourced. You can't walk into a Burger King and have someone from Thailand flip your burger. Our manufacturing jobs have already vanished by and large. But let's say for a moment that it's true and there are still jobs that will be outsourced if wages go up. The solution seems to me to be higher tariffs on imported goods or services (including overseas call centers that service the U.S. Market). If a company was taxed heavily on imports, and on services directed at U.S. markets, then they would have a cost advantage of employing in the markets they serve. The government needs to make it more costly to outsource than it is to pay reasonable wages. Of course that could mean reduced profit for companies, or more likely increased prices for goods/services. Luckily, wages will have increased to pay for the increase in prices at the low end. However, this increase in price would only affect the lowest end of any given industry. The walmarts and the McDonald's. Old navy might need to increase prices but Macy's wouldn't (they pay well over minimum and even employ union labor). There would certainly be winners and losers as is the case for every policy change. It's pretty likely though that the winners would hugely outnumber the losers and lead to a stronger overall economy if people were paid a livable wage.	0.0

You really can't be serious. We live in a dystopian present? It is truly a great time to be alive.  Compare where we are now to where we've been at any point in human history; by most objective measures the quality of life for the average person is as high or higher than it's ever been.  Sure we face some challenges, but the challenges we face now seem a lot better than what they have been in the past.If you want to say that our political structure is corrupt, I ask you to look at a history book.  What we're dealing with now is nowhere near as bad as it was during the political-machine days of the industrial era.  Democracies around the world are opening up to women, the poor and minorities.   You can't argue that most democracies are better off than they were in the past, when as recently as 60 years ago there was active, government supported voter suppression against minorities in the United States. 100 years ago, women couldn't even vote.  If you say that conditions are bad for working people, I again ask that we look at our history.  Working conditions 100 years ago were terrible for the average worker.  As recently as 30 years ago, most industries refused to accept women in high paying or high profile positions.  You can't objectively say that we live in a dystopian present, because it's simply not true.	0.0

A few suggestions which, combined, should make customizing your base easier:  * make "place" and "decorations" at the top of the menu instead of "Purchase" and "functions"  * make tablet menus go back by hitting 'x' rather than having an "exit" option at each part of the menu.  * allow placable items and "delete item" to be registered to item slots  * remove the confirm question from "delete item"  * increase number of slots to which items can be registered to at least six(for 4 directional tiles, tablet, and delete all easily accessed)  * While I'm suggesting messing with registers, could you make the Instant Lapras pack activate without any button presses simply by walking onto water, and make hitting 'c' facing water automatically use the best fishing rod available?  * weirdly shaped decorations that are better for making walls  * also, here's a bug: using any portal in the "cyan caverns" type base makes bridges cease to function(you cannot walk on them, you can use surf facing them, their graphics go over the player's)  Thanks for taking the time to read our suggestions!	0.0

It's also not that manly when you've got fairly mature guys oggling girls who are young enough to be their daughter.The reverse can also be somewhat unsettling, when you've got mature ladies oggling boys who are young enough to be their sons.Shit. I'm turning into Mary Whitehouse.	0.0

Read through the series twice, with probably a four year gap between readings. Do you enjoy any other hard sci-fi novels, or just space fantasy? Player of Games has the benefit of being a single novel, fantastical tale from the Culture universe, while the Mars trilogy is more of a realistic story spanning across a large number of characters and centuries. Both in my opinion are great. That being said, I quit books, TV shows, and movies midway all the time.If you didn't like the first portions of Red Mars, don't beat yourself up about it... Maybe try reading through it at a more leisurely pace instead of forcing it.	0.0

Different therapists have different styles.  It's really hard to know what's best until you try it.  We had two fails and one that really seemed to"get" us. Don't be afraid to seek another if you don't feel like it's going anywhere.   And most importantly, be respectful to each other and must importantly honest with the therapist and each other.  Otherwise it's a waste of time and money and hope.Our homework was mostly about communication,  but our issue wasnt sex (is the thing we are finally great at). Are you wondering if there is likely to be physical homework?  I read a post somewhere that the therapist had suggested a certain frequency.  Again I'm sure it's very different from therapist to therapist.   Good luck OP!!!!!	0.0

Even using 9/11 in that way just seems so... self-dismissive. Now not only did I not give a shit about the story, but I don't see why the hell I should have given a shit about the characters and wonder why I wasted my time watching the film?And it still comes off as manipulative. And even worse, it brings into the film a last-minute afterthought of a theme closes out before possibly expanding on that.But the main thing that keeps me from accepting that is how the film doesn't end with that moment, but goes out of its way to show "Oh, look here's how Robert Pattinson's death - not the deaths of everyone else in 9/11 - but his character's death affected the others."	0.0

Well but a creator god must have changed its mind, as it turned from a non-creating god into a creating god.  Prayer also is supposed to change its mind from an unhelping god to a helping one.  It's actually a very deep question.  &gt; Present them with new information  I think this is theoretically possible, as the god allegedly gave other people free will this necessarily means it resigns from certain informaiton, for example what you will do and why.  So if that person now communicates with you they can tell you what they need and you had avoided from knowing.  It's like a parent that owns all the money in the house, so can't really borrow any from a child (how can an all-owning person borrow somthing?).  However this parent can choose to give the child an allowance, and now the parent purposefully declined to decide what happens to this money after that.

Your mistake is that you're averaging numbers that shouldn't be averaged. You're saying the risk is acceptable because it's extremely low (basically), but that only works as long as the worst case scenario has some manageable outcome. Case in point, if you had to insure nuclear power plants, the costs would be prohibitively expensive, enough to make nuclear power plants economically infeasible.For example, very few people die from asteroids or other objects from outer space each year, yet there's a real possibility that humanity could be wiped out by a single big meteor, should risk assessment for meteors be based on the low average numbers or on the catastrophic worst case? Yeah, a nuclear meltdown won't end humanity, but it's about as catastrophic an event as can happen in peaceful countries, certainly more catastrophic than an airplane crash.	0.0

I don't know how many more times I can do this. It's been at least 17 now and I am exhausted. The first time, I was so confused that I was almost too late. The second time, I thought it was just an unbelievable case of déjà vu or the most vivid dream ever. By the third time, I stared to realize the nightmare I am currently living. The timing is set so that I have just enough time to get the last mile back to the house. As I open my eyes, I can see the smoke. On my first trip, I thought I had just woken up outside of the fire on the lawn. It wasn't until I heard the screams that I realized everyone was back inside the house. Every time, I wake up, I see the smoke billowing, and I take off running. I know exactly where the kids are, but even after 17 consecutive tries, I don't know how to get them out any faster. I run in, go upstairs for Jeffery. Once he is in the yard, it's down to the basement for Marie. Lastly, it's to the back bedroom for my wife. To be honest, after 17 trips, I am still not sure if she makes it. As we get out to the front yard, it always occurs to me in the most overwhelming manner how painful the burns are and how much my lungs hurt. As I roll over to my back, I feel excruciating pain all down my backside. As I feel my breath and the world around me fading, I prepare myself to do it all again. What if this is the time I don't get all three out of the house?Edit: words and spelling. I wrote this on my phone.	0.0

This story seems really out there. Not to diminish your experience, but the events you detail are so over the top, even the descriptions of your parents and girlfriend being so uncaring. The circumstances make for such a perfect storm of abuse. But like someone has said further below, you don't really give anyone the information they actually need to help you. You've told us your whole story and everyone has said to call the cops and leave but you haven't done any of that stuff. You have a psychologist cousin who in an emergency should be someone who could help. The whole story just seems suspect and I'm sorry if that offends you, but you're not really doing anything to help your situation. Everything was taken from you, including a phone, so where are you posting this from? Hard to help here... You're not even communicating with people asking you for basic information to help you.	0.0

You have to know at least some of it.  Do you realize how fucking stupid it sounds when you read a post on /r/korea, that says "Hi coming to Korea to teach English in x months, but I can't speak/read Korean"? Your sole argument is based on the fact that the person you are teaching happens to know all the basics because simply, you aren't their first teacher.  All the natives of those languages listed will have had YEARS of experience of learning english, long before you have even had your degree for.  And lets be honest, it's a fucking joke and appalling when your students second language ability is higher than yours.	0.0

A good idea in theory but not so great in practice.Remember that Milk removes all potion effects, positive and negative. So say someone goes to the trouble to make some Strength II, Speed II, extended Regen, etc. potions to be all buffed up for combat. One splash milk pot, and bam, their potions are gone and they're dead.Maybe someone even crafts a Notch Apple to be super-OP. And yet all those effects can be negated by anyone with access to a bottle, milk, and gunpowder.Long story short, the ability to completely negate enemy's potion effects using an easily-obtainable resource would make it very overpowered, and basically make all combat potions useless if they could be negated so easily.- - -Now if I could provide a counter-suggestion. What if there were a potion that temporarily prevents other potion effects from working, and prevents any new potion effects from being added? Call it a "Potion of Nullification". These potions would have *very* short durations, from say 5 to 10 seconds. But those could be very critical in intense situations. Removing an enemy's buffs long enough to get a few hits in. Removing your own slowness/poison to be able to retreat. Giving yourself a few seconds of potion invulnerablily to take down a Witch. All of these are a lot more balanced and fun than simply removing all potion effects.	0.0

I was once on a bus for an hour with a screaming 4 year old because he had misbehaved and his mother took away the little toy he was playing with as punishment.  So he stood there screaming "momma please give it back please" for the whole hour.What is the mother supposed to do in that situation?  Calmly telling the kid to be quiet is just going to make the kid louder, because he knows its working.  Giving the kid the toy back isn't the right choice either.  And yelling at or smacking the kid is going to get the mother as many bad looks as she was getting for letting the child scream.	0.0

&gt; It seems to me the value of work would be an agreement between employee and employer.In a way, this process determines the value of work, yes.&gt; Isn't the optimal value of work for the employer free, $0/hour?That's only optimal for the employer, not the employee. But I'm not talking about either... I'm talking about the *actual* value of work: What people are willing to pay for it.Certain jobs have a certain value (just like certain items/products) do. Here's an example: You go to your secret special cave, and start digging for gold. In 1 hour you find a single gold nugget. You then go a jeweller and are able to sell it for $1000. That hour of work you did is valued at $1000.Now, lets say you don't find that nugget, and all you find is a large pile of dirt. You go to your local garden centre, and they buy it off you for $10. That hour of work you did is now only worth $10.The problem with your proposal is that you metaphorically want to send people to work for $1000/hour, but all they're producing is piles of dirt, worth $10/hour. There's $990 missing in this transaction, and it needs to come from somewhere. Someone, somehow, *has to* pay that other $990... that money (ie value) can't just appear out of nowhere.	0.0

I don't think you have a firm grasp on the difference between communism and socialism. What you're describing doesn't address the base, only superstructural characteristics. Socialism operates on the same mode of production as communism, so to characterize it as a "transitional state" (whatever that is supposed to mean) doesn't make any sense. Is there some sort of mode of production between capitalism and communism? Not in Marx. Also, socialism isn't "worker ownership of capital," but the abolition of capital. Capital can only exist under capitalism, so who owns capital really doesn't make a difference to the productive process in any substantive way.	0.0

Honestly? HE didn't make her "squirt." She made herself squirt. All he did was confidently talk dirty to her.If your concern is that you are too "vanilla" to talk dirty, try another flavor.Most importantly, work on your self esteem. You need to love yourself first and foremost. That's the only real difference between a confident guy who can pull off other flavors, and one who describes himself as too "vanilla". It's not looks. It's not money. It's not a "magically grown 12" dick". It's confidence. Confidence makes a world of difference, and anyone can have it if they want it. And yes there are a billion and one reasons to love yourself. If you can be comfortable with who you are, you will feel more comfortable trying other "flavors." And if other flavors really aren't for you, then you will be ok with that too. It sounds like this girl might be a lot of fun for now, but you didn't give me the impression that she is the love of your life. So don't stress. Have your fun. Enjoy life. If it works out with her, great. If not, that will be ok too. When the right girl or guy comes along, you will know.Most importantly, if that "inner voice" is talking to you, please stay in touch with whoever those people are that you reached out to. Don't be afraid to ask a professional for help if you haven't already. We all need help sometimes.	0.0

He likely did meet the mens rea requirement for assault as it is an easy standard to meet. In Illinois, someone commits an assault when they knowingly engage in conduct which places another in reasonable apprehension of suffering a battery (an unlawful application of force). [720 ILCS 5/12-1](http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs4.asp?ActID=1876&amp;ChapterID=53&amp;SeqStart=20887500&amp;SeqEnd=22225000). The mens rea element of that statute is the word "knowingly." It doesn't matter if he was upset, if he knew his conduct might place the officers in reasonable apprehension of a battery, he committed assault. There's a lot of factual details missing from this article. It doesn't specify what actions he took that constituted assault. Say he tried to run in and was restrained, then merely struggled for a couple of seconds to get loose. That'd be hard to swing as assault because the officers would not have been in "reasonable apprehension" of a battery and struggling to get loose likely does not constitute a threat of battery. But if he grabbed a lead pipe and started taking swings at officers, then he definitely committed assault. I suspect his actions were more like the latter than the former example, simply because the police deal with these situations often and usually do not arrest people for being out of sorts over a pet's death. He did something to piss them off. Maybe not something deserving a felony prosecution, but something beyond what a normal, upset person would do in that situation.Without more facts we can't infer whether he had the appropriate state of mind, but I also see nothing indicating that he lacked it. Considering that the mens rea requirement is unaffected by how upset he was about his dog, I don't think that will be at issue in this case. The outcome is much more likely dependent on how extreme the specific conduct that constituted the assault was. As I described above, there are significant legal and moral differences between a short burst of hysterical resistance and threatening deadly violence. The extremity of his behavior can also provide evidence about his state of mind; the more extraordinary his actions the more likely it is that he intended to commit assault.	0.0

Whales being less of a draw doesn't mean they are still not the biggest draw buy a huge margin. Attendance only dropped 100,000 year to year. If you lose the whales, no matter how big the purely educational exhibits become, gaining back that 100,000 wouldn't matter in the face of losing the million or 2 million that come to see whales jump out of the water. SeaWorld is a theme park with animals as the main attraction. You're proposing they become a children's educational resource. As much as I love that idea, and as wrong as I think it is to keep whales or other high intelligence animals in captivity, that's just not going to do anything but cost them more money. Also...unrelated...how is a 1-2% dip in attendance causing an 84% dip in profits? It just occurred to me that that doesn't make a ton of sense.	0.0

not everything grows rapidly all the time and because RT is more community-focused than other companies, having constant but slow growth is okay.also, i think RT is in an ajustment period right now. this has been a significant year for new things. lazer team will be huge but its not out yet, there's the new site and funhaus, achievement hunter has had some growing pains (needing new office space, having tons of new ideas, new channel), from what i understand there's a bunch of production stuff in the works (enough that the RT recap ended), obviously animation has a ton to do too. give it a few months and we are going to be overwhelmed with content from all sides like an omni-directional dick suck fest.youtube is not the end-all be-all of internet media. in fact, popular youtubers are making their own fucking websites now because they are realizing that having an online presence away from the popular social media of the time is important, and RT knew that eons ago.plus, don't you think that between the years of shared experience and education between the founders, and the butt-tons of creative energy and intelliegence of all the people hired since, that they would be able to tell if something was amiss? i do. i have faith in RT and the people that are part of it.they know what they are doing. let them do.	0.0

If you're shouting on twitter calling gamers and gamergaters misogynists, rascists, terrorists, transphobes, homophobes, xenophobes, and pedophiles then, maybe, you are against gamers and gamergate. Is it wrong to say that you would be Anti-Gamer/Anti-Gamergate?Pro and Anti exist because of convenience. I keep seeing Anti-gamergate people (as in, people who truly believe we're idiots for thinking corruption in journalism is an issue that needs to be talked about) complaining saying "There's no such thing as Anti-Gamergate". And then there are others complaining about us calling them Anti-Gamer because it's rude and not fun to be labeled (see sentence 1 for examples).	0.0

&gt;It's basically full auto at that point.this is my point. it already stops becoming a burst weapon and becomes an automatic weapon with firing rate equal to/greater than the static burst rate. i'm not saying my idea wouldn't completely change how they work, i'm saying it would make them always be burst weapons instead of sometimes automatics, sometimes burst guns. as is, if you put fire rate in them, the best you can hope for is a failed automatic weapon. my idea would make it so the bursts are tighter while there is still a delay between the bursts (when using fire rate mods) instead of the current "put fire rate in gun to make it equivalent to an automatic." if you spammed fire rate into one on my idea it would throw bullets out exasperatingly fast, sure, but it would still obviously be a burst weapon.&gt;and you will probably see how too powerful it might get.and why should burst weapons be forbidden to be excellent weapons? sure, the hind will probably always suck but that doesn't mean they all should be forced to be. i for one want to actually like the paracyst but how burst weapons work it's alt-fire-only or bust with it.	0.0

I wanted to look behind the numbers on this:* There's two bars - the visitor's bar and the member's bar. They're both counted as a single bar for the purposes of FOI requests and tallying revenue raised. The visitor's bar is open to anyone within the Leinster House complex, whilst the member's bar is for TDs and Senators only. * Assuming a pint of Guinness is still [4.30](http://www.thejournal.ie/dail-bar-guinness-cheaper-than-buswells-or-shelbourne-1071316-Sep2013/), and lager is 4.70, we can get a total price for 301 pints of Guinness and 139 pints of lager as just under 1947.60. Finally, let's assume that 139 spirits were bought, equivalent to the amount of lager. That adds another 570 or so to the total. So we're left with an estimated grand expenditure on drink at around 2600 euros, out of the 7500 or so spent in total. So we've an estimated 4900 or so left over. * So what else is the Dáíl bar used for? Food. The bar doubles as a cafe, and primarily fulfils this function (rather than being a bar) during business hours. I suspect that the far greater remainder was spent on this, rather than on TDs being out on the piss. * So considering this, and the far higher number of visitors and other staff on hand that day, it is understandable why the bar raised that much revenue.	0.0

The curve on the first deck looks top heavy, and the mana base seems off - you have 10 green sources and only 7 each of blue and red, but green doesn't seem more important than other colours. Could have gone 8/8/8 there easily. It would have been even more consistent to be mainly two colours with a lighter splash for a third.The second deck has no way to beat a Woolly Loxodon or other big bombs except Ugin or Valorous Stance. This deck seems like it will just lose if the game ever gets to parity, the only real top end you have is Abzan Guide and Ugin. If you were aiming to make an aggro deck then Ugin does not belong. BW warriors decks need a couple of Rush of Battle or Raiders' Spoils type effects to be able to punch through bigger blockers. Also... why the hell are you not playing Abzan Charm? Definitely cut Runemark, add in Abzan Charm and run a couple more green sources.The third deck looks solid except I would have cut the Runemark for Cunning Strike.	0.0

Its a good weapon vs Tanks and MAXs. But if you are an infantry focused player, you are robbing yourself of a third, and very effective, anti-infantry weapon. Sometimes you get ambushed and you can barely escape into cover. You are now stuck in a corner with no shield/overshield. And you know that guy is probably already rushing you. Pulling out your RL and go for the one-shot kill is then the only real option you have to win that fight. If you have the lancer equipped in that kind of situation, why even run for cover?

This game is very broken. The only people sticking around are the ones who can tolerate the game-breaking bugs, myself included in that. I love it, warts and all, but I would bet that most people who try it don't bother to stick around.The other problem is the lack of proper tutorial or training. The game is very dense, there is a lot to know, and right now its a sink-or-swim situation and most new players have long drowned, if you follow me.We only just got Outfits, but the whole squad/outfit interface is fucking terrible. The spawn system sucks, the game has a ton of rendering issues which make it very frustrating to play. I have to completely close out of the game at least twice every night due to artifacts left on the screen (usually the damage indicator) which make it difficult to see.Given all that, do you think most people who try it are going to stick around? It is fun when it works, but there are a lot of hurdles to overcome before you get to the meat of this game, more hurdles than most would bother with.	0.0

&gt;You don't need a top-of-the-line gaming PC to be a member of the Master Race. You just have to recognize that PC is objectively superior to consoles in every way possible This is all we ask.

A lot of open D-bags get downvoted here. The majority of us are understanding and welcoming.  In fact many of us joined PC gaming pretty much from console gaming so it would be hypocritical to hate on another for a choice to play on something else. Peasantry is a frame of mind.

The problem isn't whether they win or lose, it's that playing the game at full speed is frustrating when you are still trying to learn your basic mechanics. Imagine you want to learn to play guitar. You can choose two teachers. Teacher A shows you the chords once then tells you to play the song full tempo and yells at you when you mess up. Teacher B shows you how the chords then has you play the song slowly. Once you have the song down he has you play at the faster speed. Which teacher would you choose? SC2 now is like teacher A.

it's interesting that you highlight that a part of what makes 'My Bed' a feminist piece is that it's not made in the way of typically male dominated mediums, like painting. I saw an interview with Emin once and she mentioned that she did painting for her BA and MA (royal college on the painting course) but she doesn't like making paintings that much because she doesn't think she's very good at it. I wonder if she had more belief in herself as a painter, would she have just made a painting of a bed? She was clearly very interested in painting and wanted to hone her skills, but I wonder if she moved into installation because she didn't believe in her ability that much, but still did it because she loves painting (she cites German Expressionism and Munch in particular as being influences). Given that she actually does paint and loves the history of painting, then maybe she didn't use installation for the reason you state, but that's just a thought.	0.0

&gt; If that's not convenient, most states allow you to do early voting. If you STILL can't do that, you can mail in your ballot. Those policies need to be expanded nationwide.  And would be far more effective than a holiday that, unless you work for the government, your work probably isn't going to give you off for.  Especially since the most disenfranchised groups are the ones most likely to be working on election day.  Also, there are a lot of elections.  I know Sanders is talking about November elections in even years, but what about the primary?  That's where most races are decided.  Early voting and vote by mail are available for all elections, not just generals.  Plus, we already have early voting and/or vote by mail in a lot of states, including red ones, so the political fight is more limited in scope.	0.0

The NPR-published **Listener's Encyclopedia of Classical Music** has been helpful in filling in the gaps of my limited knowledge of this era and genre.When not being a gigantic music dork, I've been reading the last(?) of Mike Carey's **Felix Castor** novels.

The Houston Texans do not own the Texans.....sorry I made my edit late on my last post. You have no argument against what I am saying. You compared a Private company getting free tax payer money for a stadium. These situations are completely different.And now your argument is I am naïve.Allen is growing and the stadium is doing fine with its capacity. Also it does not say if the 60 million $ is for x# of years of service and to maintain the grounds.Will it be in black? I do not no the books, but it is not unreasonable that a long term stadium like this is, that all revenue goes to the school, unlike your argument, can make a profit. It is also not designed just as a profit machine but a facilitie to house the Schools Student athletes and has facilities for all students. Allen is not taking away books, bunson burners, and teachers to fund any of this and it expands on learning. Again the hate Reddit gives this stadium is unfounded.

That article has links to many other sources, each one more damning than the last. The impression I walked away from was that GG was a hate campaign built on faulty premises.

The ex boyfriend was openly hostile and frank about his hatred of her. He wanted to damage her. Rape threats, death threats, stalking... and you want me to take that kind of BS seriously?

It isnt viable to take a single point and then rush the back like we did in the video but it is VERY viable to get a good lead then go back there in the last 1-2 minutesEDIT: Here is our POV: http://www.twitch.tv/lilsounddj/v/11074927?t=4h01m58s	0.0

Is it because they are Muslim, or because they are people? Because when you are talking about 1.6 billion people, the common identifier "Muslim" does little to tell you about who these people are. At that macro scale you are talking about group of people with widely varying backgrounds, economic and social situations, and just about any other measure of variety that exists within the global human populace.Unless you have done a comprehensive cross-sectional study about the motivational factors of crime among these "couple hundred million" people (which I don't even grant as an acceptable claim*), your statement is about as useful as saying "some people are bad".---*Even considering liberal estimate that about 1% of Muslims are so called troublemakers, that is about 16 million people, a far cry from the "couple hundred million" figure you so carelessly toss about.

Estagflacao, que e' o que ja estamos vivendo e o que todas analises preveem. [Essa secao de um artigo da Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagflation#Causes) pinta em todos detalhes o quadro brasileiro, mesmo sendo escrito antes dele ocorrer. Desde a queda dos precos dos commodities (e do petroleo) descrita no primeiro paragrafo\*, `as politicas fiscais descritas no segundo, que batem com as do governo petista 1:1.Alem disso, Levy e Dilma parecem se acertar no que e' na minha opiniao um erro: Insistir na desvalorizacao do real. Isso so' nao vai causar uma alta na inflacao se cortarem a expansao monetaria, subindo a taxa basica de juros (que parece que o Levy quer fazer) ou diminuindo a oferta de credito subsidiado (que parece que o Levy tambem quer fazer). Como isso ajudaria no crescimento eu nao sei. Maior competividade no mercado internacional com o real desvalorizado, pra compensar a queda dos precos dos commodities? A producao fica ainda mais cara, so' aumenta se de fato tiver uma demanda grande, que nao acho que e' o caso (a explosao de crescimento da China ja acabou e a Europa tambem na da muitos sinais de vida). De qualquer forma, se subir o juro bom pra mim, que comprou LFT. So' me arrependo de nao ter comprado dolar.O aumento de impostos nem deu tempo de ser especulado, ja salgaram a conta de luz e a gasolina ja subiu.\* Fala-se em alta para um pais importador causando aumento no custo de producao, o equivalente e' a baixa para um exportador.	0.0

Interested to hear how Cosby has made a positive impression with you. I Assumed he was good after transferring and working behind the scenes for a year, and he was hitting shots in cupcake games. That, along with rose colored glasses made me think he was really good for us.But in every game against a team with a pulse I've only seen minimal shot making on bad shot selections and overall bad decision making (firing up a quick three 2 times in a row with a huge lead late in the game tonight?), getting burned on defense (sloppy closeouts and getting beat on cuts), and whenever he drives the lane he either attempts and misses a hugely contested layup/has it blocked, or turns it over. I'll admit since I've started noticing poor plays from him I have a bias of just noticing every bad thing he does, but it FEELS to me like we have to be in the minus when he's on the court against good teams.So I'm just curious what positives he's shown you or what backs him up statistically, to get PT over someone like Nunn.	0.0

My ex husband was/is a pathological liar. If his lips were flapping - he was lying. No matter what I tried he wouldn't stop, whether it was about something important like why our bank account was empty or trivial like what he ate for lunch he just lied. He lied about his entire family, telling me his mother was a prostitute and his father was abusive, he lied in his job (and he is in the armed forces!) he would "loan" money from people and never have any intention of giving it back. He stole money from the kids bank accounts, from me.  He was also an alcoholic.There is NOTHING you can do to help her.

But just because some people have it worse, that doesn't mean the overall average should be ignored. I mean, that's what we're discussing here, right? And that "select few" is larger than it has ever been. While the happiness and prosperity is not evenly distributed, there is still more of it than perhaps any other time in human history. Those people who still have nothing will probably never have something, simply because they're in countries that don't have the means or interest to improve their lives. With that said, there are other countries who once had nothing but are beginning to have something because of medical and technological developments. Things don't need to be perfectly and evenly distributed to say that things are better overall. If one person who was once impoverished isn't anymore, things are better.	0.0

I knew someone would say it's not really a flag. So if they simply took down the fabric and started projecting giant confederate flags with lights then it'd be okay I guess. Okay you also argued about how long it was. So if they projected a confederate flag on the white house for a day nobody would have a problem? People need to stay consistent with their arguments. People keep saying confederate flags shouldn't be flown because they could be offensive to some people. Well there's a lot of things that offend different people. People can't just pick and choose what they want taken down because it offends *them*, and then turn around and choose to offend others because they agree with it, and think anyone who is offended should get over it. That's taking both sides of the same argument depending on which one suits their situation.	0.0

Everyone is focusing on the assault part of your issue, and it seems pretty well covered, so I'm going to address the other things in your post. Do you intend to go back to your husband? If you do, you're going to need to work through the needs that aren't being met in your marriage. It sounds like the strain of having to listen to your problems and be there for you emotionally while not getting the same support from you has been causing a lot of problems for him. If you can't get to a place where you can listen to his issues about his job, you do at least need to find a place of empathy from which to consider his feelings. It was, frankly, callous of you to know that your husband was suffering so much emotionally that his job made him cry and immediately start to bombard him with problems of your own. As it was bad enough to make the news, someone (or more than one person) likely *died* while he was at work. A wedding probably seems very frivolous in comparison.And that's not even considering that wanting to quit his job would probably make a sudden unexpected expense like the one you hid from him a pretty stressful thing.I think you should both be in therapy, regardless of whether you stay in the marriage.	0.0

If you say "her mom" or "your dad" or "my mother", it is not capitalized. If you just say "Mom said" or "Dad looked for his keys", you capitalize. In the first instance, you're using "mom" or "dad" as more of a category to refer to moms and dads generally, ie. of all the moms, I'm talking about hers. In the latter instance, Mom and Dad are basically being used as name replacements. Consider, could you replace the "mom" or "dad" with their name and it would still make sense? If yes, capitalize. If not, don't capitalize.	0.0

What are you talking about?Soeharto was already a corrupt bastard from the very beginning. He got in trouble over a smuggling operation with his buddy Liem Sioe Liong during his time in the military. General Subroto saved his ass from a court-martial.Many tend to forget that until near the end of the 70s many of the Soekarno Era / Revolusi generation were still pretty much around and had important roles in the government. They were pretty much responsible in the development of the nation during the early period. But due to ignorance people would credit Soeharto, which is wrong.Soeharto wasn't smart or educated enough to manage the economy. Soeharto relied on the Berkeley Mafia for that. The latter wrote the very first draft of Indonesia's economic policy for the Orde Baru inside the US embassy with US approval while Soeharto was busy butchering more than a 100 million of his own people.While in power, Soeharto slowly spread his influence by placing a number of his cronies in strategic places pushing out those older generation from the Revolusi era and those who opposed him. By the 80s Soeharto was fairly successful and that's when shit started to happen.So I'd say Soeharto real regime started in 1980. He brought back the Berkeley Mafia during the oil price slump in 1986. After the country's economy somewhat improved then Soeharto proceeded to stab them in the back. Again.As far as who is to blame, I'd start with Ibnu Sutowo, the grand daddy of Pertamina, the most revered Indonesian National Hero worshiped by all. Sutowo delivered the funds from the US to support Soeharto's coup. Sutowo practically handpicked Soeharto as the *chosen one*. One decade later Kissinger met with Sutowo to arrange for Freeport in Papua and later the acquisition of East Timor. Another decades later Sutowo's kid shoot down a waiter over a rescinded credit card. When this fucking kid runs for the next election I am changing my citizenship.In my opinion, Sutowo was the original traitor that started it all.http://www.namebase.org/scott.htmlhttp://www.contradictie.nl/1965cc/archive/2005/12/051218JomaEngl.htmlhttp://la.utexas.edu/users/hcleaver/357L/357LRansomBerkeleyMafia.htmhttp://newint.org/features/1982/10/01/ibnu/EDIT for spelling.

Their video seems to tell the tragic tale of a group of 20-something kids who just got picked up by a major record label.  They fly to California to film a video, with looks on their faces that scream, "We're going to be huge pop stars!"  Tragic, because all of them are probably in dead end jobs and have kids now, and whenever they reminisce about the good ol' days, no one even knows who 'Len' is.  Whenever the topic comes up, they have to sing a few bars until the listener nods his head, like, "Yeah, I kinda remember that one."  But what inevitably follows is "What other songs did you guys do?"  Joy turns to sadness, and they try to shift the conversation to another topic.Such a sad song.	0.0

Why do you ask? This is before the white man comes to America. There is a young native american boy sitting by the fire in the early morning.

The father replies, "Well son, it is tradition in our tribe that when we have a new member the family, we step out of the tee pee and the first thing we see is what we will name the child...why do you ask two dogs fucking"?	1.0

How many qualifying payments have you made at this point? Note that consolidating creates a new loan, so any payments made before that don't count. Payments made during in-school deferment also don't count since they aren't part of a qualifying repayment plan.Honestly, it doesn't seem like PSLF would be very beneficial in your situation. If you purposely stretch out repayment for the next ~10 years, any "forgiveness" you receive will probably be the result of all the extra interest you racked up by only paying the minimums. So I would just keep doing what you're doing and enjoy being debt-free sooner rather than later.	0.0

Where are you China? If you're in one of the larger, more cosmopolitan cities like Shanghai, there are "real" Korean skincare/makeup stores in lots of places. Innisfree, the Face Shop, Skin Food, Etude House, etc. are all around the city. I say "real" because even though they are official stores, some of the products are formulated/made/packaged in China, which could be a sketch factor for some people. A lot are still formulated/made/packaged in Korea though, Innisfree's Super Volcanic Pore Mask, for example. In my experience, prices will invariably be higher, but that's because China just has a really high import tax for everything.	0.0
Tytos' face was thunder as he made the connection. The sudden realization crashing down on him as if the Wall itself was set on his shoulders. As he pieced all the information given together. The abandonment of his known guards, the disappearance of the steward and guards perhaps the Stark could trust. Symeon Stark had not gone to Essos. He fled and was now in hiding. "My Lady." he said as calmly as he could. However, given the fact that this man, this *Snake* was out of his reach and far from his wrath he needed a minute to for his rage to settle. His anger cooled he looked to the Lady of Winterfell. "For all that is good, and by the Old Gods you follow. I ask that you answer this one last question truthfully." He paused and took a breath  "Do you believe that Symeon Stark orchestrated the murder of the Prince?"	0.0

Did your supervisor actually listen to all your calls? Like was there any way to just be real with the customer and say "sorry sir they make me follow this sales script. Trust me I don't want to". Then again if you're following it and feel pressured to do so, I assume that they do listen to your calls to make sure you are following it...I know in retail I'm frequently "real" with the customers when how things work in the store are concerned. For example some signs truly being misleading, barcodes by the meat department being put in stupid hard to scan places, some of my coworkers being unprofessional, etc. The people appreciate it and it tends to help calm them down when they see I'm empathetic with their concerns and agree with them instead of just spewing the same old "I'm sorry you feel this way sir" BS.

Then when he moved away, he started seeing another woman and lied to her about me. In all instances, there was *zero* reason for him to lie; we were all open (except the woman he started seeing after he moved away, who he'd told that he was in the process of breaking up with me for, which was nowhere close to the truth).

Simply let go of the ledge by tapping away, double jump straight up, and do a non-angled Side-B before reaching the apex of the jump.This spreadsheet contains data on all possible timings where the Wolf Flash ledge cancel works on Pokemon Stadium 2. It includes data for angled Side-Bs in addition to the non-angled one I generally prefer doing. I hope this helps all you Wolf enthusiasts improve your ledge game!	0.0

Can't believe no one has said this yet...The advent of RECORDING.  Before the early 20th century, music existed on paper and in the moment of it's performance - and no where else. It was fleeting and ephemeral. You might hear a piece played once and then never hear it again, unless you could re-create it yourself or with friends.Everything about how we enjoy and consume music changed once we could own recordings of music. No longer did you need the ability to play an instrument to enjoy listening to music. That popular song? Used to be you had to play it on the piano and sing it yourself if you wanted to hear it again. Not anymore! Buy the recording, no musical ability necessary anymore. More modern recording technology also made PERFECTION possible. Live performances will always have imperfections. Now as a culture we (arguably) expect everything to be as perfect as the recordings. I think that has profound effect on musicians as well - in terms of our  expectations about our own performances. I wrote a paper about this subject in grad school. It was a really interesting topic to explore.	0.0

maybe try talking to the player first? a core tenet of being a DM is to never cause the players to lose control of their character without permission. it detracts from the fun of the game, and you can always end up doing it anyway if they agree in some form. if said player is anything near what could be considered a good roleplayer, they wouldn't ever use that metagame knowledge to their advantage.unless of course you're not the nice DM like me; in which case, drop her poor little soul in a gem and watch the havoc from behind your screen :D	0.0

1. Well technically that appearance change would be from an extremely tan Japanese tone to a regular Japanese skin tone, but we'll ignore that. But we can also assume that the opening isn't 100% reliable considering that plenty of openings purposefully omit or change details for shock factor later on. So even if you deny the possibility of skin tone change with some sort of cosmetic, it's easy to chalk it up to unreliable narrator.2. Very few people know that De Killer has those stitches, and even fewer (probably a small handful outside of his clients) know of his appearance. There's no reason for him to disguise his appearance, he merely needs a false identity. And besides, a significant part of De Killer's characterization is his confidence. He doesn't care about getting caught (because he knows he won't), he just wants to kill his target and maintain his honor. Why else would he show up to kill Simon/Souta in GK-5, or even expressly state his intent to kill Engarde?But really, character design-based "[plot holes](http://pre10.deviantart.net/e3f1/th/pre/f/2008/016/f/6/pw_comic___the_atmey_paradox_by_larkismyname.png)" are completely trite anyways.

Just how is a draw the right result? Bottom line is they didn't score. Doesn't matter if our centre backs were shaky or if they had better chances than us. They didn't score. I don't understand why people call it "luck" when a keeper puts in a good performance, he's part of the team as well. If a striker plays well and scores 2 goals people say we deserve it, if a goalie plays well and makes two massive saves then suddenly it's luck.

&gt; You can resell them but theoretically you're supposed to claim that as income and pay taxes on it. Same with a cheeseburger...if you held it and it somehow increased in value, and you sold it, it would be a capital asset and you'd have to pay a capital gain. I don't know what's nonsense about "consuming" a stock (remember, I'm using that term figuratively....don't actually eat the paper).Right.  McDonald's is even in the business of adding value to hamburgers and reselling them.  So we're agreed: there's no particular difference between purchasing a cheeseburger and purchasing a share of MSFT.  So why, again, is it fine to charge people 8% sales tax on the one but totally illegitimate to tax the other even a tiny amount?The cognitive dissonance on this subject is often astonishing.  You called stock purchases "consumption".  Rich people argue in the WSJ all the time that their income shouldn't be taxed, only consumption should be taxed, which coincidentally would shift most of the tax burden to the poor.  And now those same rich people are arguing that their consumption of stock shouldn't be taxed, because.... reasons.  It's almost as if there's no consistent theory here at all except for "don't tax rich people".&gt; Trading is moving to being a zero marginal cost activity, which will greatly increase the ability of the poor and poorly connected to investOh, that's silly.  The barrier to people with no money earning returns from capital isn't a tiny transaction fee; it's that they have no capital.	0.0

&gt; If Sri Lanka claimed half of India, would you say its fine and negotiate? If Bangladesh claimed west Bengal Your rhetorical argument is utterly Null and Void.  Because, India has a ratified Border agreement with Sri Lanka so Sri Lankan claims will be legally void.  With Bangladesh while there is a border its not settled, which says more about India, that it can not even settle a border with a friendly neighbor for 40 years while China has settled 12 Land Borders.  India started, i repeat, Started, discussion on Bangladesh border in 2011, 4 decades after Bangladesh got formed.  It will be settled in few years and **YES**, India is exchanging Land with Bangladesh. India is set to lose about 44 sq Kms of land, which is quite a bit esp. given the fact that this land is not barren, there are people there, lots of them.  And lastly, *legally speaking*, China can claim Indian territory up to Kanyakumari and India can claim Chinese territory up to Yalu River on their border with North Korea, BECAUSE, there is no piece of paper which tells either side which land is which because there is no border.So you get the idea, i hope.	0.0

We're not authorized to confiscate anything. Only the cops can do that--granted, we often have to call the cops since we have what I'll call a "prohib list," and a "super prohib, call-the-cops-if-you-see-it" list, and you'd be suprised how many people bring in everything from kubatons to ammunition to gun parts to detonators to grenades and so on. Yes, I've seen every single one of those things; in fact, I work 40 hrs a week and easily see ammo every other day. Anyway, so yeah, we don't confiscate anything. We have to give you the option of taking the item outside of the secure area (to put it in your car, checked bag, give to a friend, whatever), OR voluntarily abandoning it on site. Weirdest thing I've had a bag check on? This guy was traveling with 4 bottles of his piss. And yes, folks, piss is a liquid and must follow the 3-1-1 rule.

The point is that most people respect that people in the service industry are humans too.  Walking in 5 minutes before close turns their shift from 7-8 hours into an additional hour or however long it takes for the food, plus to eat. If it is a small burger or something, then whatever.  But I work at a place known for deep dish pizza.  It takes 45 minutes to cook one.  If you walk into our restaurant 5 minutes before close and ask for one, you are not wrong.  You are just an asshole.  It takes minimal planning to avoid this (ie do not walk into a restaurant 5 fucking minutes before close; what are you thinking?).  Or just get it to-go and no server will be stuck waiting on your table when they could either be getting rest for their next shift, or be doing something more productive with their life than waiting on your late, and dumb, ass.	0.0

Here's what I got out of it, though I could of course be very, very wrong (please correct me if so!):- Aankia had a debt with the Voss group. We don't know why, but I think it's likely inherited from her dad. Iirc he died from a car running into him; I'm guessing this was the Voss group's. Perhaps he got mixed up in something, couldn't repay Voss, but out of "pity" and "goodwill" got to save either his daughter or wife. He chose Aankia, Voss kept his word and let her live, but killed Aankia's father.- Killiel was faced with some impossible choices. Her eyes and hands are both needed for her quest to find her father, and for archery. She found her real dad, but then had to choose between the dad she didn't truly know, and the man who had acted as her father all her life. She was also confronted with her angst regarding her size, but came to realize that all sizes have their pros and cons (or highs and lows, if you will). Lastly, she gained her father's approval and respect, even getting a positive acknowledgement for her potion-brewing skills.- S'lethkk also had to make a choice. To stay within the "comfort" of the darkness, even though he knew that would mean he could never truly feel free, or to challenge the very thing that kept him going, and stand against that darkness. My take on the humiliation scene is that it is an amplified combination of his shame for his appearance, as well as his feeling of powerlesness against the shadow phantom (who there was now an entire *race* of). Him then finding and subsequentally killing Klath by becoming Kinegedias just seems to speak to his feeling of helplesness, and at this point maybe even inadequacy.- Lemley had to finally face and come to accept her dreaded history of (seemingly?) having killed her parents. She was also faced with the task of saving her child-like innocence. First with little Lemley, and later with the doors. To me the left door represented innocence and humanity, the right one coldness and machineness, both in terms of bionic limbs as well as her attitude, and the center door represented the middle way; the compromise to a "full" Lemley. I can't explain the symbolism behind the ladder. In the end though, her locket was in a way carrying her parents with her, which I think she really needed.Again, just my take on it! I would love to hear the actual meanings and symbols, or perhaps even find out next week. ;)	0.0

&gt; "Rooms to which one can return" is a great concept, and gets at some things other than plot that movies can do. One of the reasons most amateur and professional film criticism/analysis is so overwhelmingly focused on plot is that it's hard to talk about the poetics of film.This reminds me of why I hate music journalism so much. Music means something far beyond its lyrics, far beyond the fashion and politics of the performer, far beyond their relevance and how the group is an integral product of their time and so forth. But music journalists don't understand music. They can't express what's good about music itself, because it's so hard to articulate, so they can only talk about Frank Zappa's ridiculous lyrics without realizing why people think the instrumental section in "St. Alphonzo's Pancake Breakfast" is so fantastic.Plus, Totoro is the absolute *perfect* example of the virtues of the poetics of film, those "rooms to which one can return." It's one of the most beloved and maybe objectively the greatest children's movie of all time, and there's almost no plot. You watch two Japanese girls and their father living in a rural town just doing whatever, and sometimes a Totoro shows up. It's slowly paced and the only time when things "get going" in the traditional sense is when they receive the telegram about their mother's health and Mei runs off during the last 10 or 15 minutes of the movie.But kids *love it!* It was the favorite movie of my cousins and I when we were all between the ages of four and eight. How could a movie where so little happens captivate children, who get bored so easily and always need entertainment? It's the poetry. It's those things you can't articulate. It's the film's sense of wonder that draws you in, the beauty of the artistry and the music, the appeal of the characters and the Totoros themselves, and the very real relationship the two sisters have that is so authentic between children of that age. It's seemingly inconsequential stuff like laughing to make the dust sprites leave the house, or seeing a hospitalized mother reading her daughter's letters and smiling, or watching a huge furry animal rapturous beyond belief as the bigger raindrops fall on his umbrella.	0.0

It's a no-win. Assume I'm a somewhat attractive female. A somewhat attractive male makes conversation with me, a stranger. If I smile back when he smiles, thank him for his compliments, engage in conversation, I'm "flirting" and "leading him on". If I tell him right up front that I'm not available I'm "full of myself" for assuming he's into me. It sucks. But at least if a girl straight up tells you she has a boyfriend she's made an effort to communicate and spare you your time and energy if you *are* hitting on her. And if you're not, then perhaps just appreciate that she was trying and just got the wires crossed?

I really shouldn't have to explain why that's insulting. But, here goes. Prepare for some real long-windedness.In saying, "I never understood why people find these interesting." you said two things. One, you implied that people who found them interesting were somehow wrong for doing so. And two, you said it was flat out uninteresting. That's not constructive. That is, plain and simple, a negative opinion, one which you stated in a factual manner, rather than one that stated it was purely your opinion.In saying, "It's obviously not impressive" you, again, insulted those who like them, telling them their view of what is impressive or not is "obviously" wrong. This fragment also implies what he did takes, literally, no skill. Again, this is your opinion. But you made it way worse than the previous sentence by saying, "obviously". You state your opinion as though it is FACT. Hard fact. Not cool, not productive, not right."it takes all skill away from the player." confirms that you feel it takes no skill. Perhaps you have a different idea of what skill is, but the dictionary definition is, "the ability to do something that comes from training, experience, or practice" Reflex-based muscle memory driven competition is not the only example of skill that can come from this game. And, understanding how to do TAS inputs takes, well, all three of those to some degree. It's rare to see someone just jump into TASing and do it damned well right off the bat. This shit takes, at the very least, practice and experience, and usually some training too of some sort. Both in the TASing itself, as well as in the game and emulator, and sometimes outside all of those. Talking about "real skill" is throwing in a "not a true Scotsman" fallacy. Like, just, c'mon man. You can have skill in literally anything. There is no such thing as "real skill". There's just... Skill."So why bother" further devalues his efforts, telling him that art is, basically, useless, and then throwing in the "training" bit just further pushes that sentiment home. Not everything is about competition. Not everything is about people playing against each other. Seriously, I'm going to be blunt, as a video editor, you should know this. Otherwise, we wouldn't have need for you. We wouldn't watch videos. We'd all be out there playing sports, or League, or Smash, or any other competition game. And, sure, that's taking what you said a bit far, but... Still. You basically told him what he did had no reason to exist. His video brought a smile to my face. It probably brought one to his, as well. That's why he should bother.So, no, I didn't insult you because I disagree. I insulted you because you were rude. Because I value artistic mediums in whatever form they may come. And... God, I just really have a sore spot for people like you. People who say, "They shouldn't." or even, "I don't like it so I don't see why they should." Open your mind a little bit. Maybe it doesn't take AS MUCH skill as actually playing at a high level, but... That doesn't mean he shouldn't bother. That doesn't mean it's not impressive. That doesn't mean others didn't enjoy it.I mean, if you don't enjoy it? Fine, cool, no problem. But there's better things to do than to tell this guy that you think his work is unimpressive, worthless, and shouldn't exist.	0.0

&gt;People say it is understandable as a cop out for doing things right... Plenty of countries provide national healthcare yet some how the richest country in the world will break is back. Nationalized healthcare would.  If you're aware of any of the long-term problems associated with Europe's budget, you'd know that healthcare is near the top of the list.  Pensions and youth unemployment are far more serious problems, but healthcare will exacerbate this.  The young in Europe will pay more in taxes for less in benefits, and the only country that looks even remotely soluble (for the time being) is Germany.The vast majority of the world's medical advancements, even *weighted for marginal utility*, originate in the United States -- the only country where pharmaceutical and medical device companies can charge market rates, and make a profit.  I'm sure that's entirely coincidental that companies are more or less unwilling to take on projects that require decades to see significant returns in countries where price controls reduce their profits significantly.&gt;We waste money on military equipment our generals don't need...Wrong.  Your tax dollars aren't just buying equipment for American defense.  The United States military is the defensive backbone *for all of Western civilization*, not just for the United States.  This might actually be the one intelligent government policy we've instituted, as trusting Europe to maturely manage their independent militaries has gone badly twice in the past.&gt;...and then say there isn't enough in the Piggie bank for education and healthcare.Military operations don't incur moral hazard quite like education and healthcare do.  Costs don't exist because people are douchebags, costs exist because *things aren't free*.  If they are free, then the user will not personally experience the cost of that thing, and they will usually adjust their consumption habits to reflect that.  If the government gives out free education, the consumer will subconsciously act as if that service is actually free.  If the government gives out free healthcare, the consumer will subconsciously act as if that service is free.But all costs are generated, at the end of the day, *by consumers*.  If they are consuming these services as if they are free, they're undoubtedly consuming them *more* than they otherwise would if they knew they cost something.  And the only way to *truly* make them aware of the cost, *is to make them furnish their share of it*.  Prices communicate the scarcity of something.  Foie gras is costly to produce, and it's price reflects that.  Chicken is pretty easy to produce, and it's price reflects that.  When government steps in and declares something is free, they are removing the signal that communicates to the aggregate of consumers *how much it truly costs* to provide something -- and irretrievably damages our purchasing habits.  Look at Venezuela.  Shortages of basic goods, because the government wants to magically wave away the laws of economics by declaring things by fiat to cost less than what the producers are asking for.  Producers then can't make returns on their capital, which scares investors away, which suffocates growth and ultimately hurts people.  *Millions* of people.  Why would healthcare and education be exempt from these same rules?EDIT:  I might add, when you factor in the amount of money that we spend IN TOTAL on education, it's more than what the Department of Defense's annual budget is each year.  Most education spending takes place on the local level, with extra cherries coming from state and federal budgets.	0.0

You can usually change coverage in a life changing event. If you have her dad drop her from his insurance that may qualify (Can someone else chime in on that?) If not, then divorce her and immediately remarry, but that may be subject to a waiting period. That should definitely qualify as a life event.

If you randomly browse this subreddit how many comments do you see that are nasty towards women with a different body shape or trivialize and invalidate their issues? Now compare that to /r/smallboobproblems.It isn't just the nastiness that is the issue, it's this attitude that we should be thankful that we are being physically harassed and we're in a privileged position compared to women with smaller breasts. You can't really put a finger on anything specific because it's many little things but that attitude is pretty pervasive and offputting.I don't know why your community has a negative vibe that is centered on comparing yourself to other people in a negative way but that is the atmosphere that people read.

I think she should invest in financial education. Considering she stated she was terrible with money[...] That will be very helpful for her future. I would pay the taxes on the money, take a couple college credits in finance, buy a reasonable priced house, find a nice bank with decent return and put most of it there until she learns more about finance. If she spends all of her money cleaning up her debts then what will she have to show for it? Her goal needs to be learning how to invest so the money shes made can work for itself to pay her debts off. She might pay a large chunk of it off to minimize the monthly payments. To the OP:Don't allow your family to dictate your decisions and emotions. You owe it to yourself, so take yourself seriously. If you have to cut ties with them for a bit until you figure stuff out, go ahead. They will always love you and will respect you for your wise decisions.

I went through this article. I could not disagree with it more.why are people leaving the church? Lots of reasons. None of the true reason to have anything to do with "a dead language" or because we're not as modern or hip or whatever somebody thinks we're supposed to be. the Bible really does say that those who are not born again hates those of us who are because they are children of the devil and we are children of God.  that is going to cause conflict. If you're not sure you believe that, first of all go through the Scriptures on the differences between Christians and non-christians. Then go street witnessing.  another reason in that people are leaving the church could very well be because there's no power in the church they are attending. I'm talking about the true honest power of the Holy Ghost. The church there in can be any denomination but it would be filled with so much deadness that they don't see any reason to stay.  there are some the nominations in the United States where the entire group is as dead as a hammer. There are denominations were God hasn't been anywhere near them in years. Nothing's happening there. There are No examples there. Nobody is living the true Christian life there.  that I mean the people they go to church with her every bit as wicked and sinful as everybody in the world who doesn't go to church at all.one must also add that there is also the possibility that this or that individual has left a particular church because that individual wants to continue in whatever similar in and still be called a Christian. It could be that individual just wants to continue in sin.	0.0

This doesn't hold under scrutiny because there are plenty of poor people in my country who are more poor and have less disposable income than an average american ghetto-dweller and yet they commit the least amount of crime in my country.

Not really. Basically once he was old enough to act like a "real person" (rather than exclusively being someone to take care of), I moved away for school. Which sort of undid the closeness we had from me taking care of him when he was younger. (I do wish I was home more often to reestablish that type of relationship.) He's still not quite an adult yet (and it seems like you are?) so things could still change for me, and my situation may be different from yours. But you could try gradually interacting more with your siblings and once you feel comfortable enough to do so, let them know how you feel about this. Who knows, they may even feel the same way!I get that doing that may feel so strange that it's out of the question; after falling into the routine of behaving a particular way with someone, it can seem impossible to deviate from it.	0.0

Okay, let me get this out of the way: I love this show as much as the next guy here. But I just need to get this off my chest:&gt;I want to make two things very clear to everybody in this room: never betray me, and it's time to go.Was anybody else totally taken out by this line? This, compounded with a few other action sequences in the episode, makes me worry about Rick becoming a masturbatory mary-sue badass type character who has the answers to everything with his only character flaws being "too edgy and tormented." With a character like him it's a delicate line to toe since he already kind of naturally leans in that direction.I trust Roiland and the other's writing skills, and they seem to be aware of giving in to fanservice urges, but, eh, I don't know. I've always enjoyed the episodes that focused more evenly on both Morty *and* Rick, and kind of felt like Morty was a more compelling lead, with Rick acting as a means to propel the story forward and enable all of the wacky antics. I think the pilot and second episode of season 1 really capture this well.The last few season 1 episodes, and definitely the second and third episodes of this season so far, while all brilliant, have also seemed seemed very Rick-centric, and I hate to say that it just isn't as compelling for me, personally.	0.0

Ahh yes everyone loves to pull the LOLYALLGOTSNOWATER. Do you know who supplies the vast majority of food for this country? California, so go ahead keep cracking jokes and when suddenly all your produce skyrockets in price dont ask yourself why.  I mean its not like a pipeline to transfer water from the midwest where they have been getting historic flooding could be built. And its even crazier to think that we could just pull our water from lake tahoe which has enough water in it to blanket the entire state with 14inchs of standing water.  California is in a man made drought, we have the means to give this state water but we're far too corrupt to let that happen.  They've made us citizens reduce our usage by 25%, we were already using less than 15% of the water supply so they want us to cut back to a total 5% usage.  Meanwhile Farmers are still allowed to grow water heavy crops like Almonds, Avocados, and Alfalfa with no water cutbacks and using 80% of the supply.  Oh but they need to feed people!! well maybe those people should open their fucking eyes and send us their excess water.	0.0

What a load of bullshit PR talk. Is Server Smash a competitive event or a casual event? There is no in-between.You can not have a competitive event that has to cater to casual players. The world cup doesn't include little Jimmy from 5th grade's gym class team, no matter how much he wishes he could be running alongside Messi or how many players the elementary school has to offer.You can not have a casual event where the event admins openly mock and ridicule losers, where winners and losers are declared, brackets are set up, and world champions crowned.Everything points to SS being a competitive event, yet you're for some reason dedicated to having it be inclusive to ~~zergfits who don't treat it any differently from an alert on live~~ "a wide range of players".	0.0

[American Sniper, why we like it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azM49USDEvc)I don't think the movie makes much of a statement about the war or Middle East policy. It's more about a tough guy who kicks ass and instinctively other tough men admire guys like Kyle and women are attracted to him. Liberals hate it because they are more effeminate neckbeards and have generally been the ones who are getting their asses kicked and ignored by women. That is why liberals always side with the weak and promote victimhood as the highest value and can't stand movies like this.	0.0

He asked where the hell "here" was. They told him to leave "here".Where is here? He is standing in the fucking street where they told him to go the first time. When he asks the fat pig tells him to leave downtown. I seriously expected to hear "nigger" at the end of that sentence from the fat cop.He was asking what he had done wrong, no one could articulate what he had done wrong other than piss off the cops by having the balls to ask what he had done wrong.So, lets address your post. You say he was drunk and made an ass of himself.Being drunk isn't illegal. Making an ass of yourself isn't illegal. He was no longer on private property and was trying to find out what the fuck he was being harassed for.So here we have a case of a number of officers who simply don't give a fuck knowing that even if they were to execute im and put it up on youtube or "cnn" as the one cop says they still wouldn't be punished for it.	0.0

If you go out to eat with someone and everyone else decides to get drinks except them, don't repeatedly say things like "you want me to buy you a drink" or "why don't you get one".

In my opinion, your inability to believe in Genesis and insistence on believing evolutionary theory shows that you have been duped by the collective argumentation of a world that is under the control of Satan. With that said, though, you can still have a strong Christian faith without believing matter of fact. You must understand, though, that Christianity is faith in the bible. When you don't believe in one part, what's stopping you from disbelieving any other part that you don't like, agree with, causes you confusion, or gets attacked by secularists peddling their limited observations as science?Most Christians I know that maintain a biblical faith but don't see a literal creation story understand Genesis to be true, but not directly. There is the day age theory or the gap theory for example. Or they see genesis 1 as the creation of Adam, and part of the world, but not all of it. Or they see genesis as a vision, that it is a description of creation as it appeared to someone who wrote down their perspective.Basically, I would think before calling the creation story as some flatly made up myth. When you're doing that you have given up faith in the bible.	0.0

Hi, FRST student here, currently in second year. They say ["proof is in the mug"](http://i.imgur.com/Ubx36lb.jpg) right?!Great program with lots of good instructors. First year is fairly simple with courses that introduce you to important some of the most important aspects of forestry. You start off with classes such as hydrology, soils, botany, forest measures(surveying) etc. By second year this all comes together for courses like silviculture, ecology, forest roads/harvesting. Second year is definitely more intensive in terms of workload, but it's still a lot of fun. Being with the same group of people for almost all the classes is a nice bonus too. You really build that sense of camaraderie with your fellow classmates and get to know each other fairly well (lots of pub nights, game nights, and even a chili cook off). Teachers are very friendly and have good senses of humour. * Michel may seem pretty tough, but once you get to know him he's a really funny guy with a vast knowledge of the forest industry in Canada.* Bill is very nice and easy going kind of guy. He's done a lot of research in the past and is very good at all things forest.* Doug can be a tough marker, but his classes are great! We're just about to start "Doug's Bugs" (Entomology) this semester. * Pat is one of the most enthusiastic people you will ever meet. Fire Management is a lot of fun with him teaching.* Jim has some great stories and does a great job teaching harvesting and road building. The classroom has a job board as well to help students find summer jobs. Last year I work in a remote provincial park, great adventure!Anyway, that's sort of an overview of my thoughts on the program. I'm happy to answer any specifics in terms of teachers, classes, etc. Please ask away, any question of comment you have.Also, don't hesitate to contact one of the profs about checking out the campus/coming for a visit. [Bill and Doug](https://www2.viu.ca/forestry/Brag-Page/Our-People.asp#doug) are currently the department co-chairs and would be very happy to help out a possible future student.	0.0

Agreed with you there on the Wagner, Hocking, and Roberts.

A woman was taking golf lessons and had just started playing her first round when she suffered a bee sting. Her pain was so bad that she ran to the clubhouse for medical assistance. The golf pro saw her heading back and said, “What’s wrong?” “I was stung by a bee!” she said. “Where?” he asked. “Between the first and second hole.” she replied. He nodded and said, “Your stance is far too wide.”	1.0

Eu resolvi os meus problemas de dificuldade em adormecer com melatonina, é uma hormona natural que ajudou-me a regular o sono/insónia. Tem acção sedativa e reguladora do sono. Eu compro o da Bioforma que também contem triptofane http://www.bioformaonline.com/index.php/component/virtuemart/melatonina-night-40-comp-bioforma-detail?Itemid=0 . Tens que também voltar a regular o teu relogio interno, deitar-te mais ou menos à mesma hora e tentar dormir 7 e 8 horas, só dessa forma é que irás habituar-te e passado algumas semanas, não irás precisar de tomar o suplemento. Tentei 3 marcas diferentes e só esse teve o efeito desejado e sem efeitos secundários como por exemplo mau gosto bocal por causa de algum ingrediente na composição, etc. Garanto-te que funciona.	0.0

&gt;how it's being used [by propagandists]I think it's much more likely that some people misuse the term because they don't fully understand the difference, than it is for me to believe that all of the people who misuse the term are engaged in a massive conspiracy among tens of millions of people to smear the definition. I'll go with [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) on this one, but you're free to disagree.&gt; Second, even if it was true that doesn't mean that what's popular is true.&gt;&gt;eg, in the 70s it was popular to define "gay" as a "mental illness"As I stated in my previous comment, "English is fluid and changing, and definitions are defined by how people use them". This means that accepted definitions in certain time periods may not be accepted definitions in other time periods. In 1970, homosexuality was legitimately considered to be a mental illness, even though it's no longer considered a mental illness today. Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean that it's not also a definition. For example, we can look up gay in the dictionary and find that [one of the accepted definitions for "Gay" is "Bad"](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gay?s=t).People who use the term "gay" to mean "bad" are not *lying*, but they are being offensive. Eventually, we may come to stop accepting "gay" as meaning "bad" and that definition will come to be removed from the dictionary, but for the time being, that is an acceptable definition for the word. Those who use, while offensive, are not *lying*.&gt;Under your "reasoning" whatever propaganda meanings for words the states advocates (which are practically always the most common) would be valid.No, you are incorrect, because I never made any claim that a word could not have multiple meanings. Under my rules (which match dictionary rules) any given word may have many definitions and may be used slightly differently in different locations. For example, you might use the word "pub" in reference to a location which serves alcohol, while I might use the word "pub" in reference to a location to store computer code. We can both be using correct definitions of the word, even though we use the word differently in our social circles.	0.0

Stop doing drugs. Move away from and Stay away from people who do drugs. Dont buy drugs. Start to think to yourself "Hey, you are an asshole, stop being an asshole and enjoy life". Smoke pot. Eat good food. Jack off. Work out. Go to the doctor and get a physical. Once again I must re-iterate the self-talk part, Talk to yourself and others. A normal person with avg. IQ can do some work and figure out whats wrong and how to fix it. Find some hobbies that dont involve drugs or danger. Be social with people that arent fucking drug addicts scumbags. Dont do drugs anytime your life doesnt go the way you want it. Cuz it wont. Ever. Until it does, while you are sober. Then what? Have fun and look around at all the beauty. Remember everytime you look around that it could all go to shit at anytime and picture yourself in a coma with no arms and no dick. Anytime you start being a bitch and thinking you should do drugs, picture a gravestone with your dumb face on it. Picture your family crying over it. It works for me.

A lot of what you just typed can also be pinged...Drg in 1 min - just ping the empty dragon pit, we can work out its a reminder its spawning soon.Lets group and push - just ping a tower or OMW to a lane (the extra 'authorative' version is ping the teammate pissing around, then ping the lane)Finish these two camps then top - omw ping to the second camp, omw ping to the lane you're ganking, etcWe need ward coverage - just use (?) for missing area. People who can ward safely should get the message.And so on. The only thing you 100% can't communicate is timers like flash down x minutes. But ping is ALWAYS easier to understand than chat, and you should ping instead of chat whenever you can do it.	0.0

&gt; The vague notion I have of it is that x dimensional space can be represented in fewer than x dimensions.This is basically right. It all started with research into baryonic physics. Baryons are composite objects composed of three quarks, where the three quarks are held together by "strings" of gluons. Each quark is "connected" to each other quark by one of these "strings," and the strings can stretch and flex. It should be pretty easy to see that understanding the motions of these three quarks would be *really* difficult, because they're each free to move in any direction at any time.So to simplify the problem, some physicists (most notably Leonard Susskind) thought, "What would this baryon look like if it were shooting past me at the speed of light?" If that were true, then the baryon would be *length-contracted* along one axis to exactly zero. It'd be "flattened," in other words, like a pancake, so the quarks could only move in a plane. But it'd still be the same object. It'd just be that object looked at from a point of view that eliminates one degree of freedom from the problem, making the mathematics *much* simpler.From this emerged what's called the "holographic principle," which is the idea that *some* physical systems can be reduced in complexity by imagining they're "projected," essentially, onto a two-dimensional surface. Specifically, the surface we're talking about is an *event horizon.* In this case, we're talking about a special type of event horizon called a *light cone.* If you mush a baryon up against a light cone (by imagining it flying past you at the speed of light) then you simplify it so you can study it more easily.There's also such a thing as the *cosmological event horizon.* It's the event horizon that exists because the metric of spacetime is expanding, and at a certain distance from us there lies a locus of points that are effectively receding at the speed of light. This surface is interesting to us in a couple respects. First, we can directly observe that surface by looking at the cosmic microwave background; this tells us certain things about the observable universe. And second, we can imagine that the *entire observable universe* is "painted" on that surface and do mathematics on it, much like we imagined the baryon painted on the light cone. This may end up simplifying certain problems in cosmology. (It hasn't yet, especially.)So yes, you're right. The laypeople who talk about "the hologram theory of the universe" have no idea what they're babbling about. The universe is not a hologram. The surface of last scattering is interesting because in some ways there's information contained in that surface that is analogous to a hologram. There are mathematical tricks we can do that turn three-dimensional problems into two-dimensional problems by looking at them from certain points of view, by "painting" those problems on event horizons. But all that stuff about "everything's just a hologram maaaaan" is bull. It's completely made up.	0.0

It sucks that you didn't have a good weekend, but I don't see how that was anybody else's fault. Yes, there are quite a few fans who aren't that pleasant to be around for 2+ hours, but speaking for myself, whenever I saw somebody from RT on the floor or walking around, of course I would try and get a picture/autograph with them. Why do you expect thousands of people who want to meet them step back specifically for you?You make it sound like you're above everybody else ("a decent human being") who asked for something like that when you're complaining that they didn't go out of their way to meet you out of the 40k fans that were there. They made themselves as accessible as they could over the course of the entire weekend. If you hadn't left in a huff after the AH panel, you would have known that a ton of RT people (including Ryan, if we're talking strictly AH) did impromptu signings near the end of the day. If you had been literally anywhere in the convention center, chances are, you would have been able to meet an RT member. Like hell, I met a ton of RT staff simply by keeping an eye out and realizing when they would have an opportunity to be around the floor, not by yelling at them to come find me.	0.0

And what's their excuse every other time? because in the last 2months (probably a lot long, didn't care to check further) there's not been any updates that have improved game play, but there have been at least three updates that allows them to earn more money.Bloodhound, merchandise and now the stickers.Just realize that Valve's only milking the CS:GO community, they'll never put any actual effort into improving the game and that will be the death of it.If there's anything the history of Valve have shown us it's the fact they don't care one slightest bit about cs.1.6 didn't even get the simplest stuff fixed, and the few updates that came the broke the game.I guess this will get downvoted into oblivion by ignorant people that believe that there's an update waiting around the corner with 128tick, fixed hit boxes, improved maps, fixed ruleset in MM, team MM, nerfed run and gun, fixed hair accuracy, rainbows, unicorns, water that tastes like beer and every other thing you could possible imagine.I hate to break it to you, but Valve doesn't give a shit and they'll never fix the game.	0.0

It's kind of the equivalent of calling a middle aged man 'boy' (doesn't work so well with woman/girl sadly), it's...technically correct, both 'man' and 'boy' are the same gender, but it's incorrectly used, male humans stop being 'boys' once they reach a certain age.	0.0

I don't think this logic necessarily holds with Nintendo's previous strategies, but if the New 3DS is capable of playing ~Wii calibre games, like Xenoblade Chronicles, I think it makes sense for the next generation of handhelds to target functionality similar to the Wii U.  If that's going to be the approximate tech level, it would probably be in Nintendo's interest to match the hardware specs exactly (for instance, a 1080p top screen and a 480p touch screen) for easy ports of Wii U games.  That would be my strategy anyway.So if that's the direction, the earliest that I would expect a new generation of handhelds would correspond to when could Nintendo pull off the technical feat of making a portable Wii U at the pricepoint of their handhelds.  I could believe the technology is already out there today for a portable Wii U; could the Tegra K1 be up to the task?  It seems like it's in the same ballpark at least, and 1080p screens are already commonplace.  However, I don't believe it could be currently manufactured at Nintendo's desired price-point.  Recall that the 3DS launched at $250 (US) before getting slashed because that was too high.  So we might expect the next system to come out once Nintendo can make a portable Wii U for ~$200.   I would expect that time to be maybe four years away.**tl/dr:** I think the New 3DS could hold until 2019 because it will take that long to make a portable Wii U at the right price point, and I think that's the next logical technical level for Nintendo's handheld line.	0.0

My argument is that heavy shields just need a balance pass period. I think it needs to be addressed in a specific manner rather than using the EMP grenade to do it.I dont agree with the cloak changes. I think they have screwed the piss out of CQC infiltrators. I spend most of my time anymore in stalker cloak, sundy or a flash.I think stalker has been punished to shit with the cloak changes. We still have to stop to let cloak regen. If its going to be this bad just remove the timer and let us perma cloak like in ps1.I use to think really strongly that EMP grenades should drop all abilities. Someone pointed out to me that it does a crap of good now though.The fact that emp can kill all deployables and drain regular shields of anyone in the area is HUGE. Its not so much as wanting to avoid draining the heavy shield as it is not wanting to make EMP OP.I agree that infiltrators really need some love though.&gt;maybe an under barreled attachment for SMGs and scout rifles that stops abilities for a target it hits?Not a big fan of it. I wouldnt equip because it takes so long to swap from fire modes. Its just my opinion though.	0.0

TRDR Shit dude I've felt this same exact feeling,when I was coming out of a VERY far trip (seconds though it may have been). It was as if life was moving at 24 frames per second or w/e, and I would just be torn from one frame to the second. It was actually VERY painful from the friction of moving so quickly to the next frame. But yes, unfortunately it only gives the impression that you're dying in each frame (which could be argued philosophically, I'm sure) as opposed to feeling like your being reborn constantly lol.The main portion of the trip just prior to this, however, was not so painful per se. It was like a classic scene, pitch black, spotlight on you, and some lights on the counsel--alienesque but sapient creatues. Looking back on it, it sounds creepy. At the time, however, all I could feel was that I just found out. I just found out. The "counsel" knew about it all along, and thought it was hilarious that I just found out. It was the most cosmically embarrassing and frightening feeling I think I'll ever feel until perhaps I die. Why? Firstly, it was a severe feeling, 10/10. And secondly, because when I die, I may find out for real.	0.0

I would have thought the plague argument would have no place here in this subreddit. It wasn't the death of huge portions of society that caused this increasing standard of living. That flies directly in the face of everything we know about work force and total output and trade and demand etc etc etc. Just look at the demographic time bombs in places like Japan, China, and many western Countries to see what Im talking about. The crash in the population and the workforce makes it much harder, not easier, to raise the standard of living. So what did it? It was, according to my economics professors, much more likely the opening of rudimentary financial markets when the papacy began losing power and usury laws were flaunted in parts of Europe. Its likely that the Renaissance would have been even GREATER had it not been for the previous centuries of mass death.	0.0

It's a really meh narrative, level design is ok. Nice details scattered throughout, gameplay is EXTREMELY simplistic (find key to unlock door type stuff, i.e. Doom style find-the-key puzzles). Performance feels way, way lower than what I would expect for such a simple game (pretty sure it uses unity, so the creators of the game are not necessarily responsible for that, but it was probably a poor engine selection, Unreal Engine probably would have been way better).I played all the way through it. Spoiler, the big surprise at the end is that she's a lesbian... def. anticlimactic if you take gay people for granted (I do, I know tons of them, so being a lesbian really doesn't impress me).Basically it's like reading an angsty teenager's diary. Thankfully short, probably less than 6 hours all told (edit: lol, 6 hours if you're an incompetent like me, if you're good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9qlm8olmn0).As is, the game is barely more than an architectural visualization.PS: More technical stuff, but I fired it up just now and the mouse sensitivity is WAY too high, even when turned all the way down.	0.0

I'm a little horrified at the lack of personal accountability so many Redditors are having about this. Comparing this--a sport where people are seriously damaging their bodies for our ENTERTAINMENT--to things like construction, which is 100% necessary, is such a shallow argument.  One is a necessity. The other is a game. Additionally, the "**I** have no personal responsibility for players' choices" argument, after we spend hundreds and thousands of dollars on NFL merch and games, is another poor argument.  People would not be putting their health at risk if football was not such a lucrative job. And that money that they make comes directly from us as fans.  As far as the "players know the risks and make millions of dollars to deal with them" argument, we are still directly providing them with that monetary gain. Would you use that argument about a friend who had drug addiction? "They knew the risks before I gave them the drugs." Of course you wouldn't.  I'm not saying that nobody should watch football. I am, however, saying that we do share some of the responsibility for the players who are doing damage to their long-term health.  We can't absolve ourselves of responsibility when we are the direct financers of their profession.	0.0

I think the issue is **much** earlier than people realize.I remember taking my GCSE maths exams (15 years old). Our school had a close to 50/50 split girls and boys, yet I think the top 5 maths students at that point were male (keep in mind this is a higher set). I think there was one girl in the top 10.Going on to the next level this split became even bigger.At this point it's fairly clear that it's going to be more men going into higher paying jobs. In my A-level physics class (step above GCSE, before University) we had 1 girl, who later dropped out. Meaning the **entire** class was male (around 25 students).Given the high uptake of physics and maths students into high paying jobs (such as in banks) it's pretty clear this is where the discrepancy exists.What I want to know is when this gap starts to form. Does it exist at a primary level? This is the real problem.	0.0

Fallout 3 is my favorite game with New Vegas definitely being in my top 5. I have less experience with one and two but from what I've played they are extremely entertaining albeit a lot different (They were third person turn based rpg's whereas Fallout 3 and New Vegas are first person.) So from my experience at least the newer two are must plays. They'll make you laugh, they can be scary, they can be very sad. They definitely have a lot of replay value if you play on PC because of the awesome modding community. The alien thing is a DLC from Fallout 3 and is in my opinion best viewed as a What If? type scenario.But for real if you have some spare time and a little extra cash (they're pretty cheap and they go on sale all the time on steam and Xbox, not sure about PlayStation) go buy them. You'll have an awesome time and hopefully you'll love them as much as I do.	0.0

&gt; Advocating against government involvingI'd like to point out, as /u/Root_Negative did [above](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/3iv9nv/why_are_the_people_in_this_sub_so_hateful_to/cuk6zph?context=1), that there's a difference between not relying on government funding and advocating against it. I don't think many here would reject government funding if it accelerates SpaceX's plans. Most of the people seem to be quite happy that the company was awarded a contract with NASA to resupply the ISS.I don't know why you are intent to focus on this kind of dichotomy that doesn't strike me as an accurate representation of the sentiments you find in this sub, but it doesn't come off as overly honest, but looks malicious instead (maybe unintentional, maybe it's just a bit of carelessness on your part - I don't know).	0.0

Dude... what?First of all, if they horde the money, they will make less money then they would by investing it.  Seriously if you have to pay 50% tax on profits, that doesn't mean you'll suddenly decide that 100% of 0 profit is better.  Blowing it on consumption makes no sense either, since first it is taxed... so I don't see how you're claiming it would give 100% of its value.  Unless you're saying that they would spend that money before its taxed through the company they own.  Which if they're spending it on improving the company, is a good thing, and if they're spending it on themselves, is illegal.Basic income avoids the whole poverty trap thing that you're talking about with less welfare since there isn't a hard cutoff point, just a point where you're paying more taxes into UBI than you're getting out of it.  But increasing your income still gets you more income.ie:* 10k income = 0% tax, gets 10k in UBI, makes 20k* 20k income = 5% tax, gets 10k in UBI, makes 29k* 50k income = 10% tax, gets 10k in UBI, makes 55k* 100k income = 10% tax, gets 10k in UBI, makes 100k* 200k income = 10% tax, gets 10k in UBI, makes 190kobviously these rates are made up, and would be higher than 10% on people making over 100k, the progressive tax rate would still apply so they wouldn't be paying the top tax rate on ALL of their income.	0.0

A scoreline being nearly the complete opposite of the away clash against them, here are my thoughts anyhow;The Good:- We got the fucking win! - Benzema, like last week, the man is on fucking fire! The Bale assist one was handed on a plate but his second? WOW, I was literally without words when I saw it, amazing fucking curve! Great passing throughout the game too, hopefully he keeps this form up!- Isco! Simply a magician, 360 turns everywhere and a one two with Benz for his goal. He was simply amazing, so Iniesta-like, so happy he is performing so well also! - We got back into the game as soon as conceding, it's a plus, but we shouldn't be conceding in the first place.- The team was pretty solid throughout the game, after around about 5 minutes the team was well shaped and we dominated on the ball. Great to see us performing well without Ronaldo, hopefully this rolls onto the next game!- Bale's second half was much better, a few cheeky passes and was a lot less selfish, we'll talk about the bad in the next part.- Modric is so close to being back! I'm really giddy about this and can't wait. He may even be on the bench for the next game!The bad, not too many this time:- Bale - was mainly just a bad game, selfish in the first half, especially when he took the ball of James and was really surprised to see him not finish in the second half when he had that 1 on 1 chance. Overall not the worst performance though and got an assist which was nice.- Illara, I was contemplating on mentioning him but I have to admit his second half wasn't all that great, gave the ball away a little but I think it's mainly down to rustiness. I may be a little harsh for putting him here, but hopefully his game picks up, midfield contention will be tight now with Modric back and Lucas Silva coming into the team.- Conceded a goal in the first minute...again..we need to stop fucking do this. And from a corner also. The team needs to be ready from the get-go.- Khedira, he wasn't bad in any way, but just thought we wasted minutes on him at the end of the game. Still really surprised Lucas Silva wasn't on the bench. It would be best for him to go this transfer window.- That's all for now. Great game!Another two hard fixtures coming up, but for sure I think we can achieve maximum points! Hala Madrid!	0.0

I'm sorry, but where exactly did you get that from? The faster you're going, presumably the lower the angle will be. And if you take a look at the Mavic article you see that in the testing they did in Kona they saw a much higher incidence of &gt;10º angles.While I also agree with the author's conclusion, you do have to pick your equipment based on your conditions. The conclusions in the Mavic tests included swapping wheels and testing, and they saw some pretty significantly different performance (20W!) between some of the different wheels with the wind at higher angles. Obviously this is going to be different depending on where you're riding and even day-to-day conditions.	0.0

He remembers the looks on the boy's faces when they walked into that village and... oh Jesus. He shouldn't think about that now. Sometimes he still hears Tex's slow southern drawl. He remembers the smell of Brooklyn's cigarettes. He always had a pack of Luckys. But the boys are gone now... he knows that. It's--it's just that he forgets sometimes. And sometimes the way that seven looks at him... it makes him think. Sets him on edge. And he feels like he's back there... In the jungle... In the darkness.

I'm 44, American, overweight, and my penis is smaller than yours. No, I can't bring my wife to orgasm with PIV sex. Fortunately, I've realized that I have other sex tools at my disposal: my hands, my fingers, my lips, my tongue...even my nose, sometimes. Also, I'm not afraid to use sex toys (dildos/vibrators) with my wife — we go shopping for them together, and it's fun to try them out to see which ones she really likes.Young men seem to be embarrassed or intimidated to use sex toys, as if it's an admission of inferiority or defeat. You'll come to realize that 1) we can't help what nature gave us – we work with what we've got, and 2) any partner who's worth it will appreciate your body just because it's yours, regardless of shape/size/etc.My wife had four guys before she met me, and each of them had a larger penis than mine. But I'm by far the best lover she's ever been with, because I use everything at my physical disposal to make sure she is pleasured.Are there positions that are impossible due to my physical limitations? Yes — but that's due to my being overweight, rather than my penis size (having a large belly can make positions like doggy style difficult or impossible).Even though I can't bring my wife to orgasm with PIV, when I do get her to orgasm (usually with a combination of a dildo and oral), she still wants to mount me and keep fucking like crazy until she's worn out. So don't think that just because you're "small", that means you won't still be wanted.Just focus on your partner's needs, be generous and giving as a lover, and the rest will work out. Don't worry so much about something you can't change anyway.	0.0

A couple quick comments on your Vangaurd Bond ETFs:- VAB (Can Aggregate) holds 42.7% of their asset mix in bonds with a credit maturity between 1-5 years (short term), 25.6% with 5-10 year maturities (intermediate), and 31.6% as 10+ years (long term)- This heavy weighting towards short term bonds helps take a lot of the price volatility out of the ETF (shorter term maturities don't fluctuate as wildly as longer term maturities when interest rates move)- Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm assuming you are proposing a mix between VAB and VSB to further reduce volatility (by further loading with short term bonds)? The further weighting in your bond portfolio towards short term maturities may help reduce volatility, yes, but doing so also implies you are taking a bet on what rates will do. If interest rates rise, bond prices fall -- but short term bonds fall far less than long term bonds (therefore it would be implied you are assuming interest rates might fall)- By sticking with just VAB, you have a higher weighting of intermediate-term bonds, which neither soar nor slam into the ground when rates move. These bonds allow you to stay out of the game of guessing what rates will do, which I think is your (and most investors') best choice when taking a long term view	0.0

Woman here, and I think tying masculinity to the ability to get a woman off is pretty problematic. There are so many reasons a woman may have trouble orgasming at various points in her life that have little or nothing to do with the dude. (Men may be aorgasmic too, but it seems to be far rarer.) Putting in the work to please your partner is wonderful, obviously. But I have slept with and have heard stories about well meaning guys who so invested in pleasing their partners it put pressure on the women. Also there's the whole thing where some men feel inadequate or threatened when their partner orgasms much more reliably with the help of a sex toy. Ugh.I mean, reread your post. It's all about the male gaze and the man getting satisfaction from the women's reaction. Getting pleasure from your partner's pleasure, completely valid. You yourself may not be satisfied with your sex life if you can't watch women have pleasure. Sure. But come on, proclaiming that is an essential part of hetero male sexuality? No bueno.	0.0

I can see how on the surface height doesn't seem as sexual as breast or penis size, but that's a very genital focused view of sexuality that I try not to allow myself. Height, just like width of hips, communicates a lot more than which trees someone can pluck fruit from. There is nothing wrong with limiting your mates based on your preferences, but I find it hard to separate breast size from height without arbitrary feelings that one is different, which I admittedly cannot dismiss.Now on top of the sexual implications of being tall (powerful, large penis, etc), there are the objectifications that go along with the usefulness of being a tall male. Why is having a tall man important to so many women? The fetishization of a strong, protecting, powerful man is clear to see on dating websites and in popular culture. This occurs in just the same way that women are fetishized for their sexual appeal, beauty, and body image Though the male version is almost certainly less harmful, both are destructive to how we see ourselves and our behaviors as well as our mental health and self-esteem as a society.	0.0

Hey /u/neon_prayers. The selfishness verging on narcissism that characterizes being a drunk like me doesn't go away when the alcohol goes away, I found out. At times it's overwhelmingly disgusting, and if I'm disgusted with myself, you're a fool for hanging around me and I hate you for it. And because things are fucked generally, a different standard of behavior applies because, hey, change is good and that's what we're about, right?I wanted to do what I wanted to do, and did it. I found a way not to report to anyone else, including myself. This was after stopping drinking, in my first year.Ended up taking what was a bad situation and incredibly managing to make it worse, and worse. Deciding not to drink and to keeping shit together even when the baby in me says I want what I want--big challenge. Hang in there because it can get worse, or it can get better, and it's up to you. This first year is tough, no doubt, and it's not just drinking but it's life starting to intrude in its messy way.	0.0

I'm in a similar situation. I was between jobs for the last couple weeks and haven't had money for drugs. I just started a new job but haven't been paid yet and basically, I'm hating life. Being sober is so goddamn boring it makes me want to scream and knowing that it could still be a week or two until I can do drugs again is destroying my psyche. Unlike you I've never really noticed much memory impairment from doing drugs and being off of them doesn't seem to improve it all that much. I don't have any solid advice for you but I'll tell you what I'm going to do. As soon as I get paid I'm getting right back on the horse. To me, life is not worth living if I can't alter my consciousness. Is that a good thing? Maybe not but I can't go on unless I have a way if silencing the noise in my head. All I do when I'm sober is sit around reading books because they're the only thing that comes close to occupying my mind. Sorry, just had to rant. I'm so frustrated right now. Without drugs I simply find no joy in life.	0.0

I thought it look pretty bad. I watch 4 games, and no one held the spark for longer than 15-20 secs, hell mostly they were to scared to pick it up. At least one game no one scored. TTL was very low.

But to me it had poor weapon balance and poor attack/defence balance.What was nice to see was no lag, no cheaters. I wish we the community could experience that regularly.

Hey Em! First off, have you read Sethlon's Roy Guide? It gives you a very good idea of his play style in neutral and will help you understand the concept of controlling space. That said, there are a few things   I personally look for in neutral, so maybe if I explain them to you it could help. When I play neutral I typically am doing three things: I am looking for any sort of Habit I can abuse and any sort of Habit that I have been conditioning my opponent to fall into, or simply put trying to read my opponent. I am using movement options or double aerials or any sort of thing to try and bait my opponent into picking an option and then punishing. And lastly I am spacing myself and using aerials  (or the threat of my possibility of throwing an aerial) to attempt to control space. So my advice on training your neutral would be to work on these three things, individually and in combination. However, I feel like the read aspect is one of the most important parts of neutral, it gives you the ability to create opportunities for yourself to punish. Also good movement will  massively improve your neutral game and ability to bait things out of your opponent.	0.0

While I do sex in game (which is basically just pixels bumping), I also do real cam shows and whatever through Skype so it's a lot like a simple camgirl kind of situation except I wait for a customer to IM me and tell me what kind of show they want. In most areas, actual prostitution can be expensive and illegal (and probably dangerous) so in being just over the internet, on the other side of the screen, I see the attraction of staying in your bedroom and just dropping what could equate to a nice meal to have a personal show from someone across the globe. TL;DR :: No; real life tends to get in the way of some people and, much like the rest of the world, being able to get something quicker and cheaper is always more attractive. -CDxo	0.0

you are looking for guidance on what exactly ? Here is my personal belief.Shaivism is about staying attached yet detached at the same time. Attached to your dharma(duty) and detached from desire. Staying detached doesnt mean you shouldnt follow your passion, you should but shouldnt let it run your life, you should be able think extremly objectively and shouldnt let emotion come into your decision making. Shiva is married sadhu, he does his duties to his family while still remaining unaffected by kaama. Occasional meditation/Tapas can help you get to that level of objectivity in your thought process by calming you. A calm mind is an objective mind. Every time you place vibuthi on your forehead remember that everything you know in life will be ash some day so stay away from the worldly illusion and follow a path of righteous duty.	0.0

No, I'm suggesting that it's high time we stop pretending that these are isolated incidents.

They're mad about massive crimewaves brought on by Muslim immigrants, the enormous amount of sexual assaults perpetrated by their portion of the population, the beheading of policemen in the streets while forcing a schoolgirl to film it.People are not mad about one thing.

Nuclear power is fine.  So, who's going to build the new neuclear power plants ?  Takes money - investors demand a specific return, and eventually, the model for electricity will be private companies producing power, and a separate private company or multiple companies running the grid.  The reason there aren't more nuclear power plants is that it doesn't make economic sense.  Only one way to get there - a global carbon tax, which is a political hot potato.  The obstacle to more nuclear power plants is in one place and one place only - the oil and gas monopoly capitalists.	0.0

Well, the thing is, to some extent, in order for her to play that type of game at all, she will need to commit to her guild somewhat. That's how they work, and that's the main reason I don't go anywhere near those games - I don't want to have a freaking commitment to a video game circle, so I play things that I can hop on and play whenever I feel like it, and I don't have to play if I don't want to. Is there any chance that she could try playing at the times that you're usually not home?At the bare minimum, you two need to sit down and have a talk about what the two of you need in a relationship.

I comment sometimes on r/creepyPMs and something I wrote once resonated enough with another user to start a brief conversation through PMs. This user wasn't comfortable posting or commenting, because they were afraid of harassment. Of course, a reddit that makes it harder for harassers to harass could have felt like a secure enough environment for this user to comment. But as it is now, the user might have been active for years and still not generated any karma as far as i know. I didn't check.While I agree that it might be a good idea to minimize the risk of people creating accounts to just sit around for amount, I don't know if acquired karma might be a good way of measuring that. But maybe something else to ensure that the account is an active one? If a specific account has been active via upvoting/downvoting posts and comments that could give access to send PMs. That way the user don't have to expose themselves and can still prove that they are an active part of the reddit community.	0.0

I'll take the cowboys with a crossbow and sword. Yeah, crossbows have terrible reload time, but it comes with the most ammunition (I'm a bad shot), and is probably more reliably fatal than the other weapons.I choose the cowboys over the Vikings (is this a WYR or a football bet?), because I think that fighting two cowboys is either than fighting three Vikings. The Vikings armor seems to gaurd them from most of my attacks, while my own armor seems to protect me from the cowboys. This means that fighting the cowboys is probably easier for me. Even if I miss with my crossbow bolts, I can hopefully survive their 12 shots (either by dodging or relying on my armor), and then close in on them with my sword. The extra reach would be helpful in fending off their knives. The fact that the cowboys only have leather vests on and not chain mail is a boon here. The cowboys also can't pick up spent shots the way the Vikings can, which makes them preferable.	0.0

I believe there is someone out there for me and its worth all the pain in the world to wait for that person. Also I want to have a child specifically a baby princess. I can't spend the rest of my life with that person and have a child if I'm dead. I'm happy with my life and appreciate the time I had with the people in my past. Ayumi hamasaki's lyrics really made me appreciate my past and made me know that there is someone who thinks the same way as me. I listen to her music every single day for a couple hours and each squat and clean is powered by her music and reflections on my past. I was told by this who I hate but made me move on. You want to die here is a gun do it now and die as a bitch. But if you want to die, make an impression on the world that people will remember forever. Become a soldier, make a record, etc. You are given one chance at life, why die over something minor? I saw and went through a lot but I don't have terminal cancer for example. Some of my friends dealt with abuse that still scars them every day but still are happy. Once you are dead, you are dead. Life is too great to throw away over nothing.

Also the fact Labour was in a much better position after 2010 with the collapse of another centre-left party, and despite more 2010 LD opting for Labour than LD in 2015 Labour still lost. Why? The SNP, yes, but crucially because Conservatives gained a net 1.7% of the electorate according to electoral calculus. Without these voters, the gap would have been halved and Cameron would not have a majority.The author suggests the same strategy again, as though UKIP/SNP/PC voters are only voting along the left-right axis and not also nationalistic reasons.I feel like I have to keep repeating the same point, and we can debate the best way to do this, but:**Any commentator who claims Labour can be the biggest party in 2020 without gaining a significant number of Conservative voters is delusional**	0.0

I'm not really sure what I can say to address the concerns of ALL of us, but I'll do my best to say things that I've noticed. I feel like there's a lot of little issues that we face. At the top of my head, I know that there have been cases in the last few years where elderly asians got beat up by police really badly because they didn't understand what was going on and they "resisted arrest"), affirmative action hurts Asians because even though we are minorities, due to some of us being successful economically, it leads to us being treated as "white," a "model minority" status that the both the right and the left trots out as a narrative to fit their own agendas ("why can't xxx or yyy be more like the Asians?" or "hey look some token Asians are successful we must live in a race blind society!"), Asians  minority underrepresentation in cultural media (not really a political issue), discrimination and excessive stereotyping in the workplace (kind of a political issue but not really).Also, a lot of issues that face Asian Americans are socioeconomic ones too, because even though some Asian American groups are relatively doing well (Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and others), there are some that are falling through the cracks (Hmong, Vietnamese, and others), yet somehow it is widely perceived that all Asian groups are similar when they are not. A lot of Asian American immigrants are poor, cannnot speak English, have trouble getting connected to the right social services, barriers in healthcare that affect all poor ppl, etc. That's something that Bernie Sanders has going for him imoThat's off the top of my head. I'm studying right now so I'll have to come back and edit. Here's a couple links in the meantime:http://www.sfgate.com/technology/article/In-tech-even-Asians-are-left-out-at-the-top-5709457.phphttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo_ceilinghttp://www.businessinsider.com/michael-wang-says-ivy-league-discriminates-against-asians-2015-5edit #2:here's another helpful link that can be helpful about the way Asians are perceived.

It's a bad idea to make it only about her health if that's not the real problem. Based on what OP said, health is part of it, but it also sounds like it's very much about appearance and attraction. I am overweight, but was not overweight when my husband and I first got together. (Mind you, I was 18 then, 30 now, and have been heavier since my mid-20s, so he's been with me at a heavier weight for a long time.) He wants me to lose weight, and he often tries to make it about my health, but I know the real reason is he'd find me more attractive if I were thinner (he's told me so). It really pisses me off when he tries to frame it in terms of health, because I am healthier than him in most of my habits, even though I'm overweight and he isn't. I exercise 3-5 days a week (he hasn't exercised in years), don't smoke (he was a smoker until a month ago), usually eat more fruit and vegetables than him, my blood pressure, cholesterol, etc are all at healthy levels. I don't pretend that being overweight is healthy, but I hate when he basically lies to me and says his concerns are about my health. They're not, they're about my looks. That I can understand, and I have been losing weight because I know how important maintaining our attraction to each other is. That said, this is a very difficult conversation to have. I don't know the best way to do it, because my husband is not very good at it, we just have years and years of being together to help us work through this. It does sound like OP wishes his GF was more active like she used to be. Maybe try doing non-gym exercise activities together, like going for a hike on the weekend. Find a healthy dessert or dinner recipe and say, I love when you cook for me, could we make this together? OP could frame this as, these things (eating healthy, being active) are important to me to do together, maybe not all the time but some of the time.	0.0
