Warrior strength and discipline banners, plus the PS trait, provide a ridiculous boost to DPS that a necro can't hold a candle to regardless of the path. Mesmer? Perhaps, as long as it's not a dungeon where reflects are desirable, such as CM. Replacing anyone else in a competent ele/guard/thief type of composition is gimping the group, no two ways about it.I will say that Reaper gave me a bit of hope for the profession, though. I liked that it could maintain 25 stacks of vulnerability on bosses, but it's going to need more than that to break into the meta. I hope ANet does something for necros, because I genuinely feel for the profession and would love to play mine in PvE.Rather than throwing buffs at necromancers, one idea I had was having the content come to them, so to speak. Or meeting them in the middle. I don't know how this could be done, but implementing mechanics that make a necromancer's abilties desirable would be a great way to bring them into the scene. Imagine a 5-person damage buff or debuff during a boss fight that's triggered by [something necros have a lot of], and [giving them more of it than any other class].That type of suggestion has its own issues, but hey, it'd be something at least.	0.0

How did the final boss get good RNG? He literally had won the game, and got lethal 1 turn earlier by getting old murk eye. Kripp had already lost the game on turn 4, his insistence on playing Ram Wrangler is just lowering his winrate - its not even a win more card as kripp called it. Its a card with high variance, that CAN win more, but can also turn a winning game into an even one if you get a crappy beast and thus lose so much tempo. Kripps actually a really good player. I've finished top 100 last 2 seasons, and i have no doubt he's a better player than me - he just needs to play more constructed and not play joke stuff.	0.0

From [SDOT](http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/sdotfaqs.htm):&gt; How do I turn left at a traffic circle?&gt; &gt; State Law does not distinguish between a traffic circle and a larger roundabout.  Consequently, a driver turning left at a neighborhood traffic circle must proceed counterclockwise around the traffic circle.  However, we recognize that there are instances when drivers may need to turn left before a traffic circle, such as when cars park too closely to the right side of a circle or when a driver can't maneuver a larger vehicle around to the right. Turning left in front of a traffic circle in those instances can be safely performed if the driver exercises reasonable care and yields to pedestrians, bicyclists, and oncoming traffic.	0.0

If a skirt is determined to be 3.98 inches below the knee because the girl in question grew the difference between 3.98 and 4 inches, yet she was too busy attempting to adhere to all the other OCD nitpicking which appears to be innate to certain Jewish sects -and her skirt was sinfully unmended because of it- then I can see a council of Orthodox Rabbi's kvetching endlessly about the difference between 3.98 and 4 inches (.02)? and even more asinine, why she should be denied ice cream. She might also sell all the rulers required for a prize, but may have lost a penny, and thus the council of Rabbi's spends more time debating whether or not to give her some slack, or demand she walk around the local area until she sees a penny on the ground.The Rabbi in the ad claims to offer a "bracha" (blessing) to all participants who sell 4 inch rulers, 10 for a dollar, with a dividend of 4 dollar gift certificate at "daily deal"; looks like the Rabbi's are getting a 60 percent cut, with maybe 30-40 percent profit when you substract overhead for the rulers, which may or may not be made by "kosher" factories who donate the merchandise to the synagogue anyway. The whole 2 pages demonstrates dry, lifeless, legalist domination by the one of the oldest, most sophisticated, obtuse collection of cults I know of.Yeah I said all that, but constructive anti-semitism has it's place when confronted with malignant religious doctrine in the form of what we see in this post's media link.	0.0

Also the fact Labour was in a much better position after 2010 with the collapse of another centre-left party, and despite more 2010 LD opting for Labour than LD in 2015 Labour still lost. Why? The SNP, yes, but crucially because Conservatives gained a net 1.7% of the electorate according to electoral calculus. Without these voters, the gap would have been halved and Cameron would not have a majority.The author suggests the same strategy again, as though UKIP/SNP/PC voters are only voting along the left-right axis and not also nationalistic reasons.I feel like I have to keep repeating the same point, and we can debate the best way to do this, but:**Any commentator who claims Labour can be the biggest party in 2020 without gaining a significant number of Conservative voters is delusional**	0.0
Laughing is a social activity. It's not completely understood, but most people laugh more when they have company.Ever wondered why TV sitcoms usually have a laugh track but comedy movies never do? TV shows are typically watched by one or two people, at most a single family, at home, so there is less social interaction; to make people actually laugh, they add laughter (often going to the trouble and expense of inviting an audience to the recording). Movies are designed to be shown in a theatre, so the social interaction element is a given.	0.0

There's a story my mom tells about a little girl she grew up with getting left at the mall when she was two.Ok so this is late 1950s or early 1960s rural Midwest, and 2-y-o girl in question is the SEVENTH child in her family. They made a trip to the mall in the city, all nine people including parents, only every few months, because it was something like a two hour drive. So they all pile in and drive for two hours, have a busy shopping day, stocking up and getting new clothes for whichever kids had outgrown their old ones too badly, and then load up the car and head home.About 45 minutes down the road, the mom asks little Anne a question... and Anne doesn't answer, because Anne isn't in the car. Cue gigantic panic and a desperate search for a pay phone (1950s, remember?).Happy ending: they call the mall, and the people at the mall go "oh good! We found her parents!" Family drives back to the mall, and little Anne is found in the security office, being fed ice cream by the enchanted security guards. Everybody goes home ok.I can kinda see what people mean - I can't imagine leaving my one toddler accidentally behind. But losing track of one of seven kids...	0.0

&gt;Yes I did lolAh, that makes this easier then, I apologize for assuming you haven't.&gt; The anime makes flashy fights and in doing so makes characters stronger than in the novel imo. I don't think even in the anime you could say that's a sonic boom without some context around it since shockwaves could be either just effects to make fight look cool or magically based instead of physics based. This is wrong on so many levels. The anime makes the servants look way slower. The faster servants are at least mach 3 and the anime doesn't even come close to showing that. For example, the Archer vs. Lancer fight looks nothing like trading over 200 blows in seconds. Just because something looks flashy, or makes the fight look cool (I guess all explosions in fights don't mean anything huh) doesn't mean the feat is diminished. Either way a peak-human wouldn't be able to make shockwaves. &gt;So her a couple things, making his arm shake just means the attack was stronger not that it was stronger than archer, as in he was actually feeling the strikes. Did you post the wrong image, that one doesn't say unimaginable? Archer was always trying to kill thats just accurate flavor text, and then it does say he is able to now block and counter on archer but that's not exceeds in the sense he's hitting harder just a little rough translation saying he's not just on the defensive he's now able to get offensive. Like i definetly am sayimg his techniwue and strength exponentially improve as he fights archer but hes still not on their level. He was able to block there because the phantasms were doing the heavy lifting for him, he talks about in those fights how he blocks faster and better than he understands over and over and gets fucked up from the impacts of the swords and knows without them he'll get obliterated. I posted the wrong image at first and changed it. If Archer is feeling the strikes, the strength of the blow has to be near his current strength at that point. Shirou even repels a swing Archer made with all his might. Archer wasn't going for the kill at first, he was trying to break Shirou's spirit first. The Noble Phatasms are doing the heavy lifting yes, but they are also giving him the physicals to do what they want. Perfect tracing copies the stats of whoever's weapon their tracing along with the skill as seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/SfbsDnn.png).&gt;This all leaves alone what I said about the various ways archer is very weak in their fight and how Shirou doesn't get taken out of the fight immediately only because the sheath is healing him. Also the fight is much less even in the novel, Shirou can only keep going because archer stands still so Shirou needs to only stand up to keep fighting, of he moved Shirou would collapse even with the sheath. Shirou then only actually hits him, instead of losing with his strike, because archer let's him and that is explicitly said, then Shirou collapses. Finally, you have to admit, part of the reason Shirou is even able to do that much is as a kind of literary technique where their fight matches their ideals fighting so Shirou is kind powered by his determination and not his actual skill. I'm on mobile, can't. Grab the images but you sound like you know the novel well enough I mostly don't need them.Archer was weakened but you're ignoring how much Shirou was weakened and is on the verge of death. The fight is pretty much even near the end, tipping towards Shirou. His determination is fueling him but he's getting better at tracing and it allows his stats to get better near the end of the battle. The reason his stats weren't increased near the beginning, was because his projections were mere hollow illusions that took the shape and not the structure. Archer only needs to step back but that's not the point (it actually helps my point showing how fucked up Shirou was), he couldn't kill Shirou using offense at that point. Shirou hits him with the last strike because Archer let him but Archer couldn't hit Shirou either at that point. He was overwhelming Archer with speed and strength that Archer didn't expect. During the fight against Gilgamesh, Shirou was 100% healed, better at tracing and had mana amp from Tohsaka. Also, stop calling feats you don't like literary techniques or "flavor text", just because you don't think their plausible doesn't mean you can dismiss them.	0.0

Not a vendor but used to Manage a grocery store that owned them and have spoke to tons of vendors.It's a game of quantity - our machines (1 coke, 2 pepsi, 1 snack) averaged ~$800 per month. So you need quite a few to make it really profitable. It's fairly hands off but you do need to keep it stocked.Maintenance - If your machine breaks who fixes it? You can either learn or hire someone to (hopefully) fix it. If you have money new machines tend to break a little less (and have some warranties).It's not hard to get a business to use them - For the right price. If a business owner has some empty space doing nothing and rejects taking a % then they might not be the best choice anyway.Absolutely get a business license - Where I was at any vending machines had to have a specific sticker from the county to be lawful. Some kids got one off once and we couldn't sell until it was replaced. Also, you don't want all your assets liable in case someone gets sick.You can buy routes (that already have a good layout of whats needed and expected profit) or start your own (cheaper but you have to sell to locations).

Especially since the first things I mention is that I'm family-orientated and I love cooking and fashion.And that was 100% not what I was looking for, at all.It was a deliberate ploy to see if people were reading my profile (a lot were not) and if they respected women enough to be able to talk to a pretty girl who chose to be pretty in an admittedly traditional way without pigeonholing her into expectations of traditional behavior.Cut down on the shit I didn't have to reply to.	0.0

&gt;The op is self aware and therefore absolutely not selfish[sic] (Lack of punctuation not withstanding...)Self aware doesn't mean they are not selfish. In fact, **in child psychology, after a child becomes self aware they get INCREDIBLY selfish**.  The original poster is not only explaining an extremely selfish problem, in that entire post they had yet to explain why they were even worth liking in the first place.  How annoying.  Basically the description given was that of an attention whore who bounces from liking one person to liking another person SIMPLY because they are too fucking selfish to go to therapy and learn the limitations of basic human kindness.  Rude.I'm sorry, but that is NOT a strong argument for evoking ANY kind of sympathy from me.  This problem is a ***real*** problem that can cause ***real*** damage.  And I'm not about to let someone too fucking stuck on themselves maneuver a "WOE IS ME" response from their burdening others with their uncontrollable lusting.  What a sad, pathetic thing to do to others.  **What kind of human being would I be if I didn't say how this is a gross absorption of other people's energy against their will AND without their permission?**  This doesn't really sound like someone who needs ANY more of the world focused on them.  I don't have a lot of sympathy for someone so desperate in their selfishness, especially for a simple problem that can be solved with a couple of beers and getting laid... OR VOLUNTEER WORK.  I am a VERY selfish person, but even I think there should be limits.  Feel free to continue the "YOU POOR THING" circle-jerk, however.  It's Saturday night... and I have a life not on Reddit.

I can't speak to HK-51 because I've never gotten around to finishing it.

I understand that for you, the problem is not that your parents are taking your kid places, but that you feel uncomfortable not knowing where your kid is, correct? I think your parents should respect that feeling and accept that *you're* the parent this time. I can imagine you feeling very disrespected about your mom just pretending to forget. I think it would be best to have a sit-down adult-to-adult conversation with your parents, explain how you feel when you don't know where your kid is, and that you want them to acknowledge your feelings. In the end, all you need them to do is text you when they go somewhere, it's not some huge hassle for them. If they think it's unnecessary they should be able to explain why and help come up with an alternative, not just nod and then ignore your request. It's not about whether they think you need to know where they are and it's definitely not about whether people on the internet think you need to know, it's about your parents not being dismissive of your feelings. That's what needs to be made clear to them.	0.0

I agree 30E and 30F are good starting points. There's a chance you'll prefer a tighter band and want to move to a 28F/FF, but I'd start with the 30 bands first. Your 32C sister-sizes to 30D, which is at least two cup volumes small. Ironically, too-small cups will often tend to gape at the top of the cup because your breasts push them away.&gt;I was measured once as a 28DWas this done quite a while ago? If a store fitter measured you as such, that's a rare thing as in most stores that'd size you out and they have to make sales to stay in business after all. So I'm inclined to believe that size was correct or at least close at the time, but since that fitting your measurements and thus your size have changed. In many situations, breasts can grow a few sizes pretty quickly.	0.0

&gt; disintegration I might suggest a different word there as you might make the argument that gamma rays are a 'radioactive particle' but it definitely is radiation and leaves the atom in-tact albeit at a lower energy.

Thank you for permitting guilt-free promotion on this thread ! I just discovered this sub-reddit, and will strive to meet its rules of etiquette. This week I self-published my first (9k) fantasy short [Flotsam] (http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/books/1122504282?ean=2940152324587) .I am fascinated with mixing fantasy with hard science. *Flotsam* is set in a secondary world that resembles medieval South Asia. The protagonist, a scholar named Sibi, is hired by a damsel-in-distress to help rescue her husband.  The rescue takes them to prehistoric ruins, that sits within a magical Time Stream flowing ever faster into the future. And when they finally face the monster that lurks there, Sibi must exploit the Time Stream along with a bit of physics to get out alive !The story is free, and available on a few channels including Nook, Kobo, iBooks, etc. This the first story within a planned anthology and I look forward to joining this community of kindred spirits.	0.0

Maturity did not treat Eminem kindly. People were already bemoaning this with *Encore* - which came out just over 10 years ago. He was at the height of his craft at an age when his subject matter was violent, sexist and homophobic. Unfortunately he didn't keep up his energy and wit as he moved on to more mature subjects ("that's why they call it window pane" - I mean what the fuck?!). The point is, I don't understand how someone could become an Eminem fan and only have listened to songs that have a palatable subject matter. The earlier subjects were heinous - don't get me wrong - but he was a way better rapper when he was writing about those subjects.	0.0

I dont believe in "talent"I believe in dedication and passion for the craft. ...I have been told that i have talent for melody, yeah? Well, that is the thing i have been most interested in and most worked at. And it is not something that "just came" right off the bat. It is something i spent hours upon countless hours, playing with. I dont think there is anyone who just IS good at what they do, i think they must have, in each case, spent thousands of hours, making themselves good at it.Interest and passion being key. Without interest, there is no dedication. Extreme interest = extreme talent. You have to be so interested in what you do and so passionate, that you dedicate thousands of hours doing just that.	0.0

Could be, but what's the point? Your number is still tied in to the sim card, so I can still "see" you.

It was a lot easier to convince a judge that the suspect did whatever he was accused of doing if he was caught with the same phone and sim used xxx days ago when the crime happened.

&gt; potrei leggere i tuoi sproloqui per ore e orePurtroppo, come osservare la lanetta del barattolo, è un'attività improduttiva che non porta a niente. Ma mi fa piacere il tuo interesse perciò **sono disposto a darti qualche altra informazione che non getta buona luce sul mio progetto**.Infatti così come ogni rosa ha le sue spine, la mia storia, che può sembrare un'epopea dorata destinata al suo meritato successo, non è stata esente da controversie. Tutt'altro.Per riuscire a trovare la verità avevo ovviamente bisogno di soldi. Allora, col mio fedele barattolo sotto braccio e uno zaino in spalla pieno di sogni e di quella innocenza di cui soltanto un giovane da solo con il suo barattolo e i suoi ideali è capace, mi sono recato da tutti gli investitori e venture capitalist da qui fino alla Silicon Valley. Non ti puoi immaginare in quante lingue diverse ho sentito la frase "Ma questo è un coglione!" e in nessuna di queste è troppo piacevole. Provavo in tutti i modi a convincerli. Gli dicevo che era un'idea cool, al passo coi tempi e illustravo tutte le caratteristiche attrattive: ci potevi attaccare gli adesivi al tuo barattolo per personalizzarlo e perchè no farci il decoupage o attaccarci le foto delle donnine nude e farci quello che dovevi farci. Tanto che mi frega a me, il barattolo è il tuo. (ma loro dicevano che tanto oramai tutti usavano l'oculus rift per quello; dannato oculus rift!!!!). Ho pensato anche di proporre la vendita di spazi pubblicitari sui barattoli a diverse compagnie sul modello di Youtube. Ma sembrava che non ci fosse niente che io potessi dire per attirare la loro attenzione sulla lanetta che avevo tanto accuratamente e amorevolmente raccolto. Si faceva strada nella mia testa la malsana idea che fossi solo un cretino che raccoglieva spazzatura schifosa che nessuno voleva solo per metterla in un barattolo (sembra un pensiero assurdo a sentirlo dire adesso, vero?). Stavano per farmi mollare. E c'erano quasi riusciti, finchè inizai a notare una serie di coincidenze.Infatti notavo che la mia idea destava particolari anomosità in un gruppo particolare di persone: quelle che avevano l'ombelico particolarmente in fuori che, per ovvi motivi, si sentivano esclusi in quanto non producevano lanetta e quindi non potevano essere parte del progetto. Tuttavia, per il bene della scienza, ero disposto a causare degli svantaggi ad alcuni in prospettiva degli enormi vantaggi che ero sicuro ne sarebbero venuti per tutti dalle scoperte che avremo fatto sulla lanetta dell'ombelico. Dopotutto [chi ha un ombelico in fuori rappresenta solo il 10% della popolazione umana](http://www.wisegeek.org/why-do-some-people-have-innie-belly-buttons-while-others-have-outies.htm)Insomma, se nessuno avesse inventato la bomba atomica adesso non avremmo i rifugi antiatomici. E non so tu, ma io non vorrei mai vivere in un mondo senza la protezione dei rifugi antiatomici. Sono cose che ti fanno pensare...Ma ci fu un momento in cui, come una rivelazione, *misi insieme tutti i pezzi del puzzle*. Infatti **moltissimi gli imprenditori a cui mi ero rivolto avevano l'ombelico in fuori**! Incredibile! Allori capii che il loro demolire la mia proposta era solo una copertura per la loro agenda segreta. E si spiegavano tutti questi [gruppi e associazioni di persone con l'ombelico di fuori](http://www.flickriver.com/groups/682014@N23/pool/interesting/) che costantemente facevano lobby contro di me e cercavano di sabotare il mio progetto.Ma non finiva qui. Un po' di ricerche e scoprii che un'enorme numero (ben oltre il 10% che ti aspetteresti statisticamente) di [celebrità](http://www.thefrisky.com/2011-07-07/11-celebs-letting-it-all-hang-outie/) e potenti della storia avevano l'ombelico in fuori: primi ministri, conquistatori, eunuchi e [Giuliano Ferrara](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-S1_5sHNFv3Q/UccyKa2WXwI/AAAAAAAAAFw/HiJw-S7vQM0/s1600/povero-ferrara-L-w8ZYep). (il più "in fuori" che abbia mai visto, tanto da sembrare un tutt'uno con la pancia)... E la lista continua.E ovvio che qui ci sia qualcosa di grosso sotto; più grosso di me, di te e della pancia di Giuliano Ferrara. Ma non ho paura di andare fino in fondo, perchè alla fine sono sempre quel giovane col suo barattolo che per gli altri potrà essere solo pieno di spazzatura ma per me è pieno di sogni.	0.0

This story seems really out there. Not to diminish your experience, but the events you detail are so over the top, even the descriptions of your parents and girlfriend being so uncaring. The circumstances make for such a perfect storm of abuse. But like someone has said further below, you don't really give anyone the information they actually need to help you. You've told us your whole story and everyone has said to call the cops and leave but you haven't done any of that stuff. You have a psychologist cousin who in an emergency should be someone who could help. The whole story just seems suspect and I'm sorry if that offends you, but you're not really doing anything to help your situation.

eh, well. not really, no. but it's been worse.pretty much it's just that mental illness is fucking me over. don't get me wrong, things *are* getting better than they were. i'm finally at a place where i at least want to try and pick up old hobbies again in the hopes that they might be enjoyable, which is more than i can say for last year. (i found some new stuff to occupy my time then, too, but it got kinda boring fast if i'm honest).tho tbh, i couldn't really say why i'm feeling better, exactly. maybe the therapy is helping more than i initially realized? my meds have been about the same for the past few months, other than the new anti-depressant i just started taking a few days ago (which wouldn't be doing anything, yet).and really, that i'm cognizant enough of my own state to have as much awareness as i do about how things are going is a **huge** improvement.not really sure why i decided to type so much in reply. guess it's just that this is the first time in a while that i've been on an account that various friends don't know about, haha.	0.0

Uh..&gt; not practiced by the majority of Muslims, but it has acquired a religious dimension.duh, its not practiced by the majority in any religion...and&gt; Where it is practiced by Muslims, religion is frequently cited as a reasonand&gt; I would argue that religion does play a role in preserving and empowering the practiceand &gt;  Equality for Women and Girls initiative.  This initiative calls on religious leaders from all traditions to take a stand and bring “an end to the use of religious and traditional practices to justify and entrench discrimination against women and girls.” and &gt; Muslim proponents of FGM also stress the religious necessity. Midwifes and mothers insist that it is “sunnah” – an opinion shared by most Islamic clerics.  Yet, sunnah can either mean that a practice is religiously recommended or simply that it was done that way in the times of the prophet Mohammed.and &gt; Most clerics use this hadith to say circumcision is recommended, but not obligatory for women. But some say it is obligatoryNote hadith is a Islamic thing. Muhammad quotes. and...&gt; However, it is known that FGM is practised by Zaydis in Yemen, Ibhadis in Oman and at least by parts of the Ismailis (the Daudi Bohras) in India, all three being branches of the Shia (the Ibhadis less directly connected). A survey by WADI found that in the region of Kirkuk in Iraq 23 percent of Shia girls and women had undergone FGM.See what happens when you don't highlight only the parts that you want to use?

There is something called [EMTALA](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Medical_Treatment_and_Active_Labor_Act) in the US. Basically says that if you're in an emergency situation hospitals HAVE to take care of you. Also know as "anti dumping" laws. Meaning you can show up with an emergency condition to pretty much every hospital and they can't say "oh no insurance? Go to the ER 20 miles away" After treatment comes the bill, usually absurdly high. Then negotiations on the debt or default. But I won't go into that as I don't know muchSource: used to work at a medical malpractice law office.	0.0

So the issue here is that you assume that antidemocratic elements don't exist in Danish society outside the radical right-wing islamist groups. How exactly is a society "democratic" if it "screens" its inhabitants for certain political notions? No, all the proposed "solutions" to the problem of radicalisation are themselves pretty much equivalent to the thing they're trying to fight. It's absurd. The only difference is who gets to be the dominant group.The way forward isn't "screening" based on country of origin or religion (because we all know that's just a pretty way of saying based on race). The way forward is engaging marginalised minorities in a mutual dialogue, and establishing a society where the people who get pushed into radical ideologies actually have real opportunities and a vision for a brighter future. Because that's the issue, isn't it — people who feel safe, part of the community, and that they have a bright future ahead of them can't be radicalised quite as easily, Muslim or otherwise.	0.0

Amen! I don't think your harsh. Your spot on and I'm so sorry your going thru what your going thru. Everything you said couldn't be truer. This cheating and affair BS is narcissism at its finest. "My sexual needs aren't met" blah blah so that makes you entitled to cheat? Get a divorce for fucks sake then get your shit met. Marriage is give and take, about sacrificing. If you can't sacrifice the bedroom (and use a viable alternative like masturbation) then you shouldn't be married in the first place. Affairs wreck kids and they wreck marriages. At the same time I do truly feel bad for most of the people on this subreddit. You'll never know what it's like to experience a true marriage to that one perfect person. Those old school marriages that many of our grandparents had, 50-60 years married and no affairs are a thing of the past. Not because it's not a viable form but instead because we've grown into a wretched, selfish and entitled society and this subreddit is a perfect example of that.	0.0

I'm not really sure what I can say to address the concerns of ALL of us, but I'll do my best to say things that I've noticed. I feel like there's a lot of little issues that we face. At the top of my head, I know that there have been cases in the last few years where elderly asians got beat up by police really badly because they didn't understand what was going on and they "resisted arrest"), affirmative action hurts Asians because even though we are minorities, due to some of us being successful economically, it leads to us being treated as "white," a "model minority" status that the both the right and the left trots out as a narrative to fit their own agendas ("why can't xxx or yyy be more like the Asians?" or "hey look some token Asians are successful we must live in a race blind society!"), Asians  minority underrepresentation in cultural media (not really a political issue), discrimination and excessive stereotyping in the workplace (kind of a political issue but not really).Also, a lot of issues that face Asian Americans are socioeconomic ones too, because even though some Asian American groups are relatively doing well (Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and others), there are some that are falling through the cracks (Hmong, Vietnamese, and others), yet somehow it is widely perceived that all Asian groups are similar when they are not. A lot of Asian American immigrants are poor, cannnot speak English, have trouble getting connected to the right social services, barriers in healthcare that affect all poor ppl, etc. That's something that Bernie Sanders has going for him imoThat's off the top of my head. I'm studying right now so I'll have to come back and edit. Here's a couple links in the meantime:http://www.sfgate.com/technology/article/In-tech-even-Asians-are-left-out-at-the-top-5709457.phphttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo_ceilinghttp://www.businessinsider.com/michael-wang-says-ivy-league-discriminates-against-asians-2015-5edit #2:here's another helpful link that can be helpful about the way Asians are perceived. The article is flat out WRONG and in bad taste, but I thought all the reactions on r/asianamerican were spot on about how we feel and what we think and experiencehttps://www.np.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/3fp81s/asian_privilege_asian_americans_successes_are/edit #3: I'd encourage you guys to look at these issues outside the context of getting into college, because (outside of the ivies discrimination one) the other issues don't really have anything to do with college although I could see how someone might interpret them as such without looking to see what they actually are.edit #4:another r/asianamerican linkhttps://www.np.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/3fjexp/are_you_optimistic_about_the_future_for_asian/	0.0

I guess the same people complaining forgot about how bad Mark Hamill's "Noooooo!" was when he found out Vader was his father.YOU ARE RIGHT, EVERYONE SHOULD YELL NOOOOOOO WHEN SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS!But you are ignoring the fact that one was well acted, and one was poorly acted. Luke was a young guy with a history of emotion, Vader was a cold, somewhat emotionless villain - which is why when small hints of emotion come through, it's a big deal. Having his character scream NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO completely breaks that, and does it in a poor and jarring fashion. This was supposed to be his transition into that cold super villain. But the NOOOOO just brings him back to a whiny teenager in a suit and completely undoes any sort of development.

&gt; They surely are, but its not because they're black. There's white, Hispanic, etc. people in the same circumstances that black people find themselves in, the thing is that because there is more blacks in that situation (broken communities, poverty) than other races, it is defined as "the black struggle" or something of the sort.&gt; In reality the disadvantage is just being poor and living in dysfunctional communities, and every race lives it. That poor latino that mows your lawn has the same disadvantages as that black guy sitting in the corner. The difference is what they did with the advantages they do have.&gt; The problem with poor black people American society today is that "black culture" revolves around violence and "street cred" rather than getting an actual education and making something better of yourself. If a little kid wants to be like a gangster when he's older, that's the fault of the parents and community, not the society. Its only the society's fault when the kid wants and works towards becoming something good, only to be shut down because he doesn't have the money to pay for it (education) or something like that.&gt; "Black culture" breeds the former, not the latter. Kids in slums don't wanna be doctors and lawyers, they wanna be drug dealers and gangbangers. How can we fix that? You can put food on the table but if the kid doesn't wanna eat it he won't eat it. At the end of the day its on the kid himself if he chose not to eat the food. You can't force-feed education.	0.0

I mean, would you seriously put him on par with guys like Vince Carter and MJ in terms of explosiveness?  Think of it this way- out of last years crop of MVP candidates, he was clearly more athletic than Harden and Curry in his prime, but clearly not as athletic as prime Lebron or Westbrook or Blake.That doesn't make him any less of a player.edit: for reference, Kobe's vert is listed at 38" compared to 46" for Lavine and MJ.	0.0

Biased Australian here, yes absolutely, it's better for the growth of the sport.  Keeping players out of international comps is better for owners, who don't have to take a financial risk, but it reduces interest in the game for casual sports fans, why would I watch my national team if the best players my country can offer are being prevented from playing?  This could also lead to some resentment towards an NBA team, an American billionaire sabotaging my countries chance at success because he's worried about the possibility of an injury affecting his chance to make a few more hundred million dollars is not going to make me a fan of that team.  Also, for the individual player, if they were to continually turn down the opportunity to play for their nation, their public image will change in their home country, which could affect sponsorship deals outside of America.  Finally a similar example from international rugby, teams like Samoa, Tonga and Fiji are all really good at the game, but struggle to field full strength national teams because players won't be released from their club contracts.  A lot of people in the rugby community feel that this isn't fair and this might be the most important thing, sports should be fair.  It's one thing to know before the first game of a tournament has been played that the USA is going to win every game by a margin of twenty points or so, but that knowledge should come from knowing that the US has the best players in the world, not because the best players from my country have been pressured to stay away.	0.0

Well...ehh...yes and no? I mean it's the same for every team that isn't run by Rex Ryan; nobody is going out of their way to just flat out say "OUR QB SUCKS."I think the excitement is that right now, if Manziel actually was to pan out in terms of on the field play, 2016 and beyond suddenly looks so damn bright. Like, a few pieces to the puzzle away from finally breaking out of the shit. It may not (probably won't, honestly) come to pass, but I mean, if Manziel shows it on the field, instead of worrying about getting a top QB next year and mortgaging our assets to do so, then we're talking adding guys like Treadwell at WR, or Oakman in the pass rush, or Jack to cover the mid-field, and that's a completely different look and approach to the draft. It leaves us looking at a bright, easy-to-solve future as opposed to an increasingly murky one.	0.0

Just how is a draw the right result? Bottom line is they didn't score. Doesn't matter if our centre backs were shaky or if they had better chances than us. They didn't score. I don't understand why people call it "luck" when a keeper puts in a good performance, he's part of the team as well. If a striker plays well and scores 2 goals people say we deserve it, if a goalie plays well and makes two massive saves then suddenly it's luck. We deserved to win on account that we actually did score a goal.	0.0

I don't find this evidence terribly compelling for the defense. It's entirely possible that Gray intentionally injured himself *and* that the cops gave him a rough ride. The cops may, in fact, have been responding to Gray's actions as a way to punish him for trying to get them sued. "Oh, you want to get hurt on this ride, do you? I'll show you what getting hurt really means." Or it could be that the cops knew of Gray's history and the entire arrest was a setup to get back at him.What I find incredible is that Gray would have broken his own spine in order to get some money out of the cops. The cops did something that killed Gray and it needs to be investigated.	0.0

Everyone is focusing on the assault part of your issue, and it seems pretty well covered, so I'm going to address the other things in your post. Do you intend to go back to your husband? If you do, you're going to need to work through the needs that aren't being met in your marriage. It sounds like the strain of having to listen to your problems and be there for you emotionally while not getting the same support from you has been causing a lot of problems for him. If you can't get to a place where you can listen to his issues about his job, you do at least need to find a place of empathy from which to consider his feelings. It was, frankly, callous of you to know that your husband was suffering so much emotionally that his job made him cry and immediately start to bombard him with problems of your own. As it was bad enough to make the news, someone (or more than one person) likely *died* while he was at work. A wedding probably seems very frivolous in comparison.And that's not even considering that wanting to quit his job would probably make a sudden unexpected expense like the one you hid from him a pretty stressful thing.I think you should both be in therapy, regardless of whether you stay in the marriage.	0.0

Like I said, for the majority of developers it isn't worth it. Linux is starting to see a higher userbase and the games are coming in as a result. Hopefully this continues as I'm all for abandoning Windows, but there is still a ways to go. It really depends on how much money you have to spend and how much knowledge is at your disposal. Those companies you listed may already have people who know quite a bit about Linux game development. It doesn't cost any extra to utilize them. For some companies it may require hiring new employees or spending money on training your current ones. I stick to my point, some companies don't see it as being worth it. If it is worth it, there is literally no reason not to put your game on Linux. Also I don't quite get the "bend over" thing. How exactly do devs make Windows "bend over"? Some explanation here would be greatly appreciated.	0.0

**(A bit spoilery and incoherent rambling  all the way through; apologies in advance)**My take away from this segment:I love, love, love Tattletale in this, because she seems/is so vulnerable. You know how Doctor Mother and Alec say that just because one is a thinker doesn't mean one is smart? I mean, throughout the series she puts this facade of being so knowledgable (and she is!), but I wonder how frequently that is just her power. Even she admits that maybe Taylor can munchkin her Thinker powers better if Taylor was the one to have it. Also makes her admission in the later arcs much more poignant (will edit later when I see the exact quote but somehow akong the lines of "I want to show that even with these crazy smart capes like Alexandria and Faultline that I can still be the smartest person in the room"). For her part though, she's the most adoptive/ has the most healthy coping mechanism in regards to her issues among the Undersiders (cough Taylor you could improve on your control freak tendencies). But still, but still, her badassery shines through. love that woman,	0.0

The hydro-dynamically balanced piston oscillates around a central hub, guided by the division plate. A drive magnet transmits the motion of the piston to a driven magnet located within the hermetically sealed register. The driven magnet is connected to the register gear train.

&gt; When you look at the end of the Argentina special, you see just how big the crew following them isAnd that's how you know the answer to OP's question is "it's basically all staged".When you've got 40 people on site (plus a similar number back in the UK production office), nearly two dozen vehicles, and and many millions of pounds invested, you really don't leave anything to chance. Nothing at all. The whole show is carefully, meticulously planned.As an example, take the assorted vehicle breakdowns and "any man left behind" attitude. You'd never really leave someone in an inhospitable and potentially fatal situation unless you know with 100% certainty they'd be able to get out. Do you really think Jeremy Clarkson was carrying a full electrical repair set and welding kit in the back of his Porsche just in case the shock absorber sheared off and sliced through the wiring loom? Of course not -- when he was "abandoned" to make that repair, he was abandoned with a couple of support vehicles full of equipment and highly-trained mechanics.And so on and so on. It's an entertainment show based around cars, not a motoring show, and like all high-budget TV entertainment pretty much every minute of what gets shown is rehearsed and expected. That's why what happened in Argentina was so shocking to them -- for once something truly unplanned occurred and they basically just stopped the show and ran.	0.0

That's really messed up on his part.  I hate that kind of outright cruel and manipulative behavior.  And plays into one of the biggest problems I have with TRP.  So many of these guys describe the "plates" they have, and really, with their stories many of these sound like they are legitimately good girls that are getting used and taken for a ride, so the guy can feel "Alpha" by screwing over these good girls.  Sure, some of those girls are legitimate sluts/trash/etc, but I would be willing to bet that a big percentage of them aren't, they are good girls, thinking they are doing the right thing for the future and that they really love the guy and want to be with him.  I know more than a few girls that have been in this position, and ended up used and hurt.This is why many good women (and just people in general) get screwed up in life.  They try to do the right thing, they stick to their morals and work hard for it, then someone comes along and manipulates them in many different ways into doing something they didn't want to do, but because they want are told that's the only way they can have a future with this person, they go along with it.I think a good test for a man if their behavior is ok, is if the woman is a good woman (and you know who those are), would you be ok acting towards her in a way that if you had a daughter, you would be ok with a man acting towards that daughter in the future?  People need to be good to one another and upfront with what they want (short term and long term) and what they are thinking, so other people can plan accordingly.	0.0

Never heard of your idea but it appears to be a giveaway service?You want to make it easier for brothers and sisters to bless each other with free games but there's only one thing I find completely wrong with it .Part of why I would give a game away would be to feel good about myself, a boost to my ego you might say. The best way for that to happen is to scroll through my thread and read all the "thank yous," to send a couple PMs to the ecstatic winner, and *hopefully* gain a Steam buddy.On the other hand, I don't always want to risk the chance to giving a game to some lucky fuck with SLI Titans and a library fit for a king. I want to give it to someone who just spent their last dollar getting that first rig up and running or someone who needs a distraction from the shit life throws our way every now and again. Problem with this is accountability, I can write one helluva sob story too. Perhaps you guys can turn your service into something that deals with the latter. I'd feel way better about myself if I could get that game to someone who could really benefit from it without reading through a bunch of bullshit and possibly being taken for a fool.	0.0

This has been a topic of great rumination for me for years. Maybe even a decade. I've spent a lot of time thinking, talking, and writing about it, and have come to a particular conclusion. I believe in basic determinism in the way that you have described it, but there is one thing that humans do appear to have control over. That is perspective. In any given moment at any given time, we are only reacting. If I think back to any choice I've made or action I've taken, I can see that my choice or action was agency-less. Instead, it was a reaction I had based on previous experiences and held judgments combined to influence my reaction. In the same way a [Rube Goldberg machine] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmY-EBSvUcY)  unfolds, so do we. After being popped out of the womb, we cycle through a continuous series of events in which we only nominally exist. We become parts of other people's Great Machines of Life without knowing it, we do things and put ourselves in situations without knowing it, and we soak up all of these experiences, both consciously and unconsciously. In any given moment we are required to react, and that reaction is based on all of these past experiences, none of which we chose, none of which we had agency over. But, in reacting, we must *interpret* these past experiences in a way that is useful for guiding us. It's done in a split second, based on a determined series of values and desired outcomes that we hold at our center. This series of values and desired outcomes is, in my theory of free will, what I refer to as perspective. In our peaceful moments, in those times when the demands of our Great Machines take a moment to allow us to reflect and breathe, we can edit our perspectives. We can take the time to rethink our root causes, ponder the actions and reactions we have been a part of, and try to reframe our understanding of all of it. In doing so, we can actually have a pre-planned, agency-full effect on our future actions. I think that this actually aligns with your more out-there understanding of our extra dimensional organ(s). If there is one, it is our ability to conceive of our lives and ourselves outside of the Great Machine. We are able to step back, and try to look at the whole picture. This meta-cognition appears to allow us a certain level of disconnection from what is commonly referred to as reality (I believe that reality is that which does not stop existing once we stop believing in it). Feasibly, this ability to "disconnect" would be extra dimensional. We are, in fact, stepping out of the four main dimensions (the fourth being time), and able to conceive of the whole. This, and only this, is where I find there to be free will.	0.0

I want the improved 4K and other enhancements but not at the expense of my business.  Issue I have with installing another countries Denim update is how does it affect carriers signal outside the country in question?  Since I'm on AT&amp;T, I'm not willing to risk my livelihood over an update that could possibly affect my ability to run my business from my mobile device (as a freelance filmmaker and photographer, I get regular job notifications from production houses).  Those jobs are first come first serve.  Just yesterday, as a result of my having moved off of Google's Ecosystem, I'm getting job notifications sent to my phone reliably as I'm now using Office365 Business Essentials for email and calendaring and have created custom rules that send me a txt msg the moment a new job hits my inbox.  I can then accept that job within 3 minutes of it hitting my inbox.  I had set up the same rules with Google Apps for Work and my Nexus 4 and I missed a fair number of jobs as a result of the custom rules I had set up failing to notify me via text messaging.  That was when I said enough is enough with Google and Android.  I read a lot of users whine and complain about missing this or missing that on Windows Phone and how they're ditching it because of (insert reason here), but for me, the move to Windows Phone and Microsoft's ecosystem as a whole has already paid for itself very quickly (2 shoots booked just this week thank you very much).

&gt; I mean Kendrick Lamar, Danny Brown, and Olivia Tremor Control? They are all fantastic, but no where near top 100 of all time. Danny Brown I'd agree with, but Kendrick is destined for classic status. Olivia Tremor Control, like The Fiery Furnaces, might not have been massively popular (/are not massively popular) but they are absolute masters of their craft. And in the end that is what dictated a lot of this list, as you can see with the little-to-no bias for "classic" albums.Speaking of which...&gt;If this was made by one person, it would be a ridiculous list because aside from Beach Boys and the Beatles, they pretty much ignored mainstream classic rock. I think this is the first list I've seen with no mention of Zeppelin, Hendrix, Dylan, Michael Jackson, The Who, The Stones, etc.If I'm totally honest, I feel those groups' albums are often praised more for their historical influence/importance than their musicality. &gt;I think the biggest example is Nirvana In Utero winning over Nevermind. I mean, I get why an individual would like that album better, but there's no denying Nevermind as a top 100 album. Pretty sure I knew every song on that album before I became a Nirvana fan. Every one of them had the potential to be a moderately big hit. This is, yet again, prioritization of influence/importance over musicality, it seems.	0.0

I run into two types of women these days.Very clingy.  As in, "Why don't you say you miss me?" texts  when I met her at a beach for 20 minutes two weeks ago and she has a bf.The complete opposite.  I run into girls that I can go on dozens of dates with and sleep with for months and have zero ability to make a connection.  I look into their eyes and see "Error 404".I don't know which is scarier.I have worked against massive resistance and came out on top.  They weren't "the one" but they were fun.We live in strange times for dating.  Many girls I meet are just playing the ladders game with tinder and always trying to get something better.  My friends accidentally date the same women due to this all the time.  I post a picture and my friend(s) say they know her from x, y, or z.It's seems that love for many is just a feeling they get when they think they can't do any better.Sad.  Really sad.

What is it so bad for Widow to have a relationship? Most woman and men seek romantic relationships in life. Just because she became romantically involved with someone doesn't mean she has to become a damsel in distress. I will agree that if it's just in the script for the sake of it then that's a mistake, but if the writers are able to sell the idea of her with Rogers then by all means go ahead. However if they use this to turn Widow into a damsel in distress then that's a mistake, but I have no problem with her forming a relationship with an Avengers. Romantic relationships and attractions are very prevalent in both the real world and the comics.	0.0

Even if its at 10. The guy is still a top 10 WR. And is definitely elite. There's a reason teams pay attention to him when he's healthy. Ask Richard Sherman. He tears up the Seattle secondary. Not to mention being one of the best if not the absolute best run blocking WR. If we are talking elite then we need to define elite. Hilton, Hopkins, sanders, and obj are out of the question. For one they are all one hit wonders at this point. Hilton is questionable. But the rest have had one good year. Hopkins is trending upwards but elite? Get out of here. Sanders is a good WR but he has Peyton manning throwing to him. Not elite. OBJ probably will be but he was a rookie on his first season. Let's let him play another or two before we crown him elite. And Alshon had an off season but he was still good nonetheless. 1,133 yards and 10 touchdowns. And he is a top 10 blocking WR.	0.0

I am presently running a Victor/Thor team - both of whom you have.  Note that I have been playing for a while and your mileage may vary, but here's my setup.  It comes in large part thanks to advice and tips I've picked up from this subreddit over the last couple months:I run Victor (presently Level 12) with a couple of Stalwart (white) and six Steady (purple) ISOs.  I have the Lingering E-ISO (counterattacks apply poison) which I picked up during a Daily, and threw an Ionizing A-ISO in his L2.  In combat, I spam L2 until the enemy agent is gone.  After that, I only continue to use L2 if there are tech users.  I'll hit his L6 and mop up with L1 as needed.For Thor (level 14), I use the AoU Blaster alt with a couple Chaotic (white) and six Steady (purple) ISOs.  I use his personal Dynamic E-ISO (found in the Heroic roulette in mission 2.2.3 and farmed with relative ease).  For his A-ISOs I run an Aiming, a Focused, a Manifesting, and a Powerful in his L1, L2, L6, and L9 respectively.I make sure I have the Legion Pulse Rifle equipped for my Agent to exploit Victor's L2 as much as possible.  Other neat gear would include the Bug Zapper (from the present Spec Op M1 boss) if you wanted a protect Agent.  Aside from that, everything else is gravy.  The static damage and tech lockdown handles most teams quite nicely.  If you add the Mandible, Rapier, and Vigilante Mask, you will be a follow-up factory.  You want to get real nasty?  Bring Avengers Thor (70CP for the Blaster, 51 for the Bruiser...probably a little too steep since you're saving for the next Spec Op) and add Coordinated Attack to the mix.  Damn.I'm presently have 50 attacks (48 wins), and am sitting on a 1139 (top 0.89%) rating.EDIT - Grammar.  I have the writing skills of a small monkey.	0.0

You're wrong as had been pointed out already, but even if you weren't....so what?  Half the time I'm on the internet and I complain about a business I'm told "vote with your wallet".  Boycotting as a means of facilitating change is an American tradition.  Moreover I think banning someone over crying for a boycott is borderline childish.  Walmart isn't going to ban me just for all the crap that I've said about them on social media. They'll just take my money.	0.0
There's this fanfic, right, It's called Sevent Horcrux, brilliant work of humour. At some point VOldemort has some sort of plan to enter hogwarts and kill either Dumbledore or Harry (one or the other) and it fails massively, s he says "Well all right. Let's just Floo in I guess." "Can we do that?" "I don't see why not."The result ends up being that Lucius goes in first and then imediately afterwards none of them can. Turns out Flooing unauthorized to Hogwarts causes a lockdown on all the fireplaces.I think that's as good of a theory as any. Flooing in woulld ne permitted but it would cause all sorts of alarms and close the fireplaces, meaning you imedeately catch the person that tried to get in. Maybe the alarm only procs if you do a full body floo. Or maybe dumbledore lifted the alarms so that Sirius could talk to harry- After all, he admits that he was in contact with him in GOF.And besides, we have no evidence that the situation with the Floo during PoA wasn't the same as in OotP. We're just never told that.	0.0

You can usually change coverage in a life changing event. If you have her dad drop her from his insurance that may qualify (Can someone else chime in on that?) If not, then divorce her and immediately remarry, but that may be subject to a waiting period. That should definitely qualify as a life event. Maybe someone else can also chime in on the waiting period.Edit: it seems there is a 6 month waiting period for divorce in California so that won't work unfortunately	0.0

I'm pretty sure they're normal sized cars.Speeds are measured in MPH/kmH, allowing us to calculate the distance a ball has traveled by timing the speed of the ball from when it was hit to when it enters the net.Using [my own video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh8ZE0mGrtY), my shot had a speed of 47 mph. I timed it at 0.723 seconds, which is 0.0002008333 hours. Multiply that by our speed (47), and we get 0.0094391651 miles. Multiply that by 5280 to get our number of feet, and we get 49.838791728 feet. So the ball travelled almost 50 feet, which seems entirely too large a distance for RC cars.So, my conclusion is that these are full-sized (but possibly still remotely controlled- they don't have doors) cars. (Now, being that I'm terrible at math, someone tell me why my methodology suck, or this doesn't give us any conclusive information.)EDIT: We could probably get more accurate distance information by doing these calculations with a rolling ball, since the ball isn't traveling a straight line in this clip. That said, we'd need to account for friction with a rolling ball; we'd still need to do even more math. So. Yeah.	0.0

I believe there is someone out there for me and its worth all the pain in the world to wait for that person. Also I want to have a child specifically a baby princess. I can't spend the rest of my life with that person and have a child if I'm dead. I'm happy with my life and appreciate the time I had with the people in my past. Ayumi hamasaki's lyrics really made me appreciate my past and made me know that there is someone who thinks the same way as me. I listen to her music every single day for a couple hours and each squat and clean is powered by her music and reflections on my past. I was told by this who I hate but made me move on. You want to die here is a gun do it now and die as a bitch. But if you want to die, make an impression on the world that people will remember forever. Become a soldier, make a record, etc. You are given one chance at life, why die over something minor? I saw and went through a lot but I don't have terminal cancer for example.

These are not interesting patents, they simply describe a process that is literally taught in most high school chemistry classes. It describes electrolysis and then simply says you "mix" the gases in with the engine fuel to "increase efficiency." But, as patents usually are, this is useless/meaningless garbage. There may be ways of using a pure H2/O2 electrolysis source to increase the burn efficiency of hydrocarbons (my best guess is by locally raising the temperature, although how do you avoid pre-ignition?), but none would be more energy-cost effective than using the air. Electrolysis is a lossy process and electrodes used to drive reactions in this way commonly foul up due to slight impurities in the fuel (this is still a huge problem all around, fuel cells would change the world if this wasn't a problem, so if you can solve this your Nobel prize may be waiting).FWIW, I have met a surprising number of guys just like this guy and plenty are out there today claiming they're going to change the world. Sadly, not a new story. Maybe it has to do with a type of dementia or something, but I see older guys who have been engineers/scientists for a long time and they suddenly have all sorts of "world changing" ideas, get a bunch of investments, and then die. They honestly believe their work is real, but their test setups and everything are all very rudimentary (i.e. inaccurate), and they spend more time demonstrating it than testing it.	0.0

Clefable needs max HP to check the things it's gotta check. Max HP, 172 Def, 84 SpDef Calm is standard. Otherwise everything runs through it effortlessly.Talonflame runs through your team. See suggestion below.I'm not going to say don't use Conk but...Guts flame orb is not a good set. Let's take two relatively average-power attacks in OU, Keldeo's unboosted scald + secret sword.Conkeldurr switches in on Scald, takes stealth rock, gets hurt by burn, eats a secret sword next turn by getting outsped.252 SpA Keldeo Scald vs. 0 HP / 212 SpD Conkeldurr: 141-166 (40.1 - 47.2%) -- 43.8% chance to 2HKO after burn damage252 SpA Keldeo Secret Sword vs. 0 HP / 0 Def Conkeldurr: 144-171 (41 - 48.7%) -- 71.9% chance to 2HKO after burn damageBy the end of this, you'll be at 3% at best if you started at full HP before you even get off any attack, and more likely dead.Conk is just too slow, too easy to get worn down, too weak--If you're with a guts boost (basically a choice band), you'd hope for your *choice-banded STAB to KO something that's not known for its bulk like Keldeo, right?"252+ Atk Guts Conkeldurr Drain Punch vs. 0 HP / 0 Def Keldeo: 234-276 (72.4 - 85.4%) -- guaranteed 2HKO after Leftovers recoveryDarn.not even close.The moment your opponent sees the flame orb they're going to be thinking about facade--any decent player will realize this because that's one of the biggest (and only) reasons to use flame orb.__________________________________________________Replace Conkeldurr with tyranitar, which can work as a CB breaker and Clefable has rocks over flamethrower, or support ttar to run something like rocks + stabs + filler which helps with the talonflame problem a ton.	0.0

&gt; They encode the variance information as an implicit evidence parameter because it's messy (impossible?) to represent all of the proper variances just using type annotations.Sorry, again no. Unless you have a completely different meaning for "variance".There is simply no default builder factory for this:    implicitly[CanBuildFrom[Set[Int], Int, Seq[Int]]]  // not foundSet happens to be invariant in the element type, but so are mutable collections:    implicitly[CanBuildFrom[mutable.Buffer[Int], Int, Seq[Int]]]  // okYou may force conversions by providing the builder factory explicitly.    val x: Seq[Int] = Set(10,20,30).map(_ * 100)(breakOut)&gt; Also, without the implicit the List class would need another way to know what a That is (likely via a type parameter), and once erased they would have to either use reflection to get it backAgain you are confused. `That` _is_ a type parameter already. The resolution of context bounds (type classes) is a compile-time operation, this has nothing to do with reflection and erasure. The whole concept of `CanBuildFrom` is akin to a type class, precisely because you don't want to overload `map` with a closed number of cases, and not because of "erasure".	0.0

See, where you got it wrong is when you started counting BO1 and BO3 wins as the same thing. They've never beaten Na'Vi in a BO3. The only European teams they've beaten in BO3's are nV prior to their roster change and Fnatic. We all know what happened to nV - roster changes were inevitable and the team was already imploding when they met them. What people don't know is that the same goes for fnatic at the time. They too were having major issues internally when they met C9, with some players being rumored to leave and others being angry at themselves in general. So what has Cloud9 achieved? They've beat several teams in BO1's, but only beaten EU teams in BO3's who had major internal issues and were about to undergo roster changes. In short, they haven't really done much more than some BO1 upsets and gotten lucky with bracket draws. But like all the other teams out there, they'll get their chance to prove their tier at the next major in Sweden in November.	0.0

Welfare. &gt;You know what else they possess? Staggering quantities of public assistance. Take the overwhelmingly Hasidic Kiryas Joel, the poorest place in America. As the Times reported last year, “half of [its] residents receive food stamps, and one third receive Medicaid benefits and rely on federal vouchers to help pay their housing costs.” And boy, do they have children: The median household in Kiryas Joel has six people, and the median age is twelve. Many of its men learn Torah full-time instead of working, and the community’s low high-school graduation rate would be even lower if its religious schools had real academic standards. These kids are hardly being “socialized to the world of work.” And it’s not just Kiryas Joel: back in 1996, at the heart of “welfare reform,” a full third of Williamsburg’s Hasidim received public assistance.[Source](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/06/13/welfare-reform-not-for-the-orthodox.html)These tend to be very poor communities for a number of reasons. Basically when the young boys are old enough they drop out of school then they marry. The men study the Torah full time and the women might work for some time between pregnancies to support their family. But most of their income will come from public assistance. You have a few members of these communities who kind of run things and they go around and help families sign up for these welfare programs. This is very common in religious cults, you have a very similar thing in polygamist cults in Mormonism. Because bigamy is illegal you have a bunch of "single" mothers who then are put on government assistance to support themselves and their polygamist family.	0.0

From my far right family:  * He is a socialist!  * He wants free college for everyone. Not everyone wants to (or should) go to college. Also how are you going to pay for that?  * He wants to tax you at 90%!  * He is just saying things hippies and freeloaders want to hear. "If elected I will give you free stuff." I am reminded of the old saying *You cannot reason someone out of a position they did not reason themselves into.*I think the solution here lies not in wrestling ideas with people adults who are not capable of rational thought but with reaching out to those who have not yet heard of Bernie (those who live in poverty and probably don't have internet access).	0.0

Sure, but there's a case both ways. It's not as clear cut "NRL doesn't need anything from fox" as some people are making out here. As /u/boyfromthebush manetions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nrl/comments/3hkqfl/lengthy_discussion_the_nrl_has_dropped_the_ball/cu8szwq?context=3), fox still has leverage in that the only other option the NRL hasn't blown off are streaming.Fox still has to come to the table with a decent deal to get NRL onboard, but they (presumably) know that there aren't many other options if the NRL tries to get too greedy.We shouldn't even be comparing $2.5billion anyway, considering the fact that the AFL deal goes a year longer.

Funny, true story:I worked for the MA state government during part of the Romney administration. The department I worked for officially had a Romney appointee in charge, but the only thing anyone would say about the political appointee was that they had never actually seen the person come into the office.^1 However, any time the non-partisan career civil servants in the department did anything wonderful, Romney would throw a press conference with his political appointee and he would claim credit for the wonderful new thing. His photographer would attend and take pictures, and a press release, along with copies of one or two pictures, would be emailed to our office with instructions to publish them on the front page of the department web site.I was the guy who ran the department web site, so that meant me posting the press release and photos. The photos they sent were camera original data files, so they were much too large for the web. I asked for a copy of Photoshop to reduce the photos to a more usable size, but was told it'd take an act of the legislature the following year to get it, because it wasn't in the budget, and that I should use whatever software I could find on my PC. That meant the Microsoft photo editor. It did a particularly bad job of re-scaling photos, and made everything look sorta blocky.You know how people talk about Romney's square jaw? Well, after I put the photos of him through that software for re-scaling, his jaw literally looked square. He looked like RomneyBot. I asked the management if they were really sure that's what they wanted, and they told me we had no real choice, so do it. Okay... I published the press releases with the photos of RomneyBot to the web site. So when people asked me what I did back then, I used to tell them that I had a job in the state government making Romney look like a robot.---^1 I also did some work for the Deval Patrick administration, in the office of the Secretary of Education. I was a lowly contractor who was hired to push around some HTML. The Secretary of Education wanted to meet me right away, and he was totally involved with every aspect of the running of the department. He grilled me about ideas for how the web site could better serve the people of Massachusetts. I was deeply impressed with his involvement and his care for the children of our state.	0.0

I think the success of T&amp;E comes from people considering a top down view of their work, rather than the content of an individual skit or episode. Sort of like, "this is funny because this episode runs like a bad 90's public access channel" and not, "that particular sketch where they yell 'oh mama!!' over and over is comedic gold." I've watched almost every episode on AS, their stuff can be really hit or miss. But you could see how a critic of hipster, when viewing a single episode or highlight reel would say, "wow, now these guys are true artists." Their skits are better viewed as a body of work than individually, as opposed to SNL or something.Does that make them funnier or more artistic? I don't know.For other self aware humor, I'd check out what Michael Ian Black and friends did with Stella about a decade ago and The State with their show before that. Those are hilarious!	0.0

Honestly? HE didn't make her "squirt." She made herself squirt. All he did was confidently talk dirty to her.If your concern is that you are too "vanilla" to talk dirty, try another flavor.Most importantly, work on your self esteem. You need to love yourself first and foremost. That's the only real difference between a confident guy who can pull off other flavors, and one who describes himself as too "vanilla". It's not looks. It's not money. It's not a "magically grown 12" dick". It's confidence. Confidence makes a world of difference, and anyone can have it if they want it. And yes there are a billion and one reasons to love yourself. If you can be comfortable with who you are, you will feel more comfortable trying other "flavors." And if other flavors really aren't for you, then you will be ok with that too. It sounds like this girl might be a lot of fun for now, but you didn't give me the impression that she is the love of your life. So don't stress. Have your fun. Enjoy life. If it works out with her, great. If not, that will be ok too. When the right girl or guy comes along, you will know.Most importantly, if that "inner voice" is talking to you, please stay in touch with whoever those people are that you reached out to.

Good question.  Speeding up a medium makes it easier to flow or "faster".  Yes, water will speed up gouache and you generally want the gouache thinner for smaller nibs.My normal procedure for mixing gouache is to squeeze out about [1/2 inch or so](http://i.imgur.com/2rpdJW6.jpg).  Add a few drops of water (about 4 or 5) and mix so it is very thick and mix with an old brush.  This initial mixing gets all the pigment mixed so there is no unmixed paint which will gradually dissolve and affect the consistency.  Now add water till about [smooth cream](http://i.imgur.com/GPOsh1h.jpg) and try on the paper.  It probably wont work because it is still too thick, so add a few drops of water and retry, continue adding water and trying until it flows effortlessly through the nib on to the paper.  Always have water beside you and I will occasionally dip the nib into the water in case it is being stubborn.  I also have a damp cloth to clean the nib during the lettering.  During the day you will have to remix regularly and occasionally add water to replace that lost through evaporation.The consistency or speed of your gouache is a personal matter.  If it flows nice for you and gives you the thicks/thins you like then it is good.  I prefer mine a bit thinner because I like thin hairlines. A good exercise is to practice lettering with a 2 - 3 mm nib and dirty water.  Done correctly, it should leave a nice letter, raised above the paper, showing the surface tension of the water.  If you let it dry, it will leave a grey letter.  The exercise helps in developing your pen pressure and knowledge of water based medium as water is one extreme and unmixed gouache is the other extreme.  I hope that makes sense.&gt; Is that a symptom of needing to sharpen the nib, speed up the gouache, or inexperience?  Yes to all three and dont forget to add the paper, sundries, time of day, your mood etc. It is a balance.  A famous calligrapher once said something to the effect that you know you are a calligrapher when you can make the finest hairlines you want.Thanks for the questions and I hope I have helped a bit.  Your lettering on other threads is very nice so dont quit now.	0.0

edit: Okay, I like the post, but it really should have been archived.  Fucking gazi amateurs...  Hello GamerGhazi poster.  Whatsup?I see you are fishing for some "SEE THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT ETHICS WHEN IT DOESN'T HAVE TO DO WITH ~~GAMING~~ HATING WOMEN" fodder.  This post should be removed for not being archived.  Here I did the work for you.https://archive.is/EVYXjedit: &gt;Woolich was interviewed for an August 13 Buzzfeed article that recounted how she was stalked for years by an older man - beginning when she was a teenager and continuing after she went to college 3,000 miles away - and how her story went viral after it became enmeshed with the gun lobby's efforts to allow students to carry firearms on college campuses.Of course it would be buzzfeed...&gt;In her interview with Buzzfeed, Woolich criticized Lott, alleging that he pressured her into allowing him to submit an op-ed he wrote -- "Dear Dartmouth, I am one of your students, I am being stalked, please let me carry a gun to protect myself" -- to FoxNews.com under her name.I would question how he pressured her, but that is pretty immaterial - this is pretty clearly an ethical violation regardless of the politics surrounding it.  Has nothing to do with gaming though.&gt;Woolrich told Buzzfeed that her primary objective in telling her story publicly last year was to raise awareness about stalking, but that Lott's "first priority was his cause" of pro-gun advocacy, explaining, "He saw me as a really great asset" in that endeavor. She added that in the brief time she spent with Lott, "I was trying to be brave and just speak up. I didn't realize I was being turned into an NRA puppet."Yep.  Ideology comes before ethics.	0.0

On the contrary, this is a typical outcome, especially for taxpayer-funded projects. This is not specific to bioinformatic research. Here is what you need to know:* The funding for the project covered salaries and expenses (luxury automobiles and mansions).* A paper will be published to fulfill bureaucratic requirements (nobody will read it).* Everyone but you will be given above-average performance reviews for their involvement.* With 40 authors, your former superiors "could not possibly oversee such a large project given their meager budget".* If you turn this into a debacle, your superiors will be given substantially increased funding to help them prevent people like you from sabotaging important projects like this in the future.* Because you were so meddlesome, you will be given lead scapegoatship on the paper.* It was really "selfish" of you to "demand first authorship" the way you did.* You obviously have "poor social skills" and "are not a team player".* You "intentionally concealed the inappropriateness of the statistical analysis, perpetrated an academic fraud, and tried to blame it on your superiors when they caught you in your lies".* Your superiors "tried to help you save your career" by "discreetly asking you to leave the project after it was over", but "as a disgruntled former employee, you continued to seek revenge for the imaginary wrongs done to you".* You may be brought up on charges or sent for compulsory psychiatric/drug rehabilitation if you continue "your tragic, antisocial behavior".* If you continue, your girlfriend/boyfriend/spouse will leave you for someone with a luxury automobile and a mansion, due to your "deep-seated emotional problems" and "failure to become a productive member of society" like your former superiors.Understand? :)In all seriousness, I sympathize with your horror. Try not to have a psychotic break. You have simply been misguided. Find a good therapist to help you cope.

Very few are flipping out on each other.  The drunkest guy at the party thinks everybody's as drunk as he is.  Most people are not that guy.  Most people really don't give a shit.  As you noted above, "most are just good people..." and that's the truth.People who think that unless there is an authority keeping people from chopping each other up are reacting to an inner need to BE controlled in order to avoid indulging in their violent impulses (which seem to be much more real than the actual world around them).We pretty much see the world from our own point of view.	0.0

Haha, wut? No it doesn't. Staying simple just means you repeat a smaller number of actions ad nauseum. I've seen competitive Halo play, all BR's and frag grenades. Nothing creative about that, and there's nothing creative about the twitch shooting of something like Quake or UT, that's just pure reflexes. Even CS players generally have to slow down to manage their weapon's recoil. And besides, even if the above isn't true, Quake, CS and UT are not Halo, and Halo does not have to abide by their rules.	0.0

&gt;It would be needed in this situationExcept not, because your game isn't broken. You have an option to kill her, which won't ruin your game, and an option to de-aggro her, which also won't ruin your game. You can also, of course, simply ignore her.None of these options result in an unplayable game, therefore it is not at all necessary. The only time I'd consider it necessary is if your game was literally unplayable and the only way to fix it would be to cheat (eg, if you got glitched into a wall or something).&gt;I play on a laptop with a controller, my hand rests over the mouse pad. occasionally my hand touches the pad causing it to attack.Well, that's life. You have to be careful with NPCs in Dark Souls. You can aggro them. You aggroed her. It's that simple. It's still 100% your fault, even if it was unintentional. The game isn't doing anything unfair, it's responding to your actions.&gt;If I kill her she will die along with the bon-fire she devoted her life to. Then go de-aggro her.  Your options now are to kill her and sacrifice the bonfire (Something I do frequently when I play through myself for her soul, by the way) or go talk to Oswald. Cheating is not the answer to this problem, this is a normal part of gameplay that you, the player, caused, and now you have to deal with the consequences.Dark Souls is a game of actions and consequences. This is simply how it goes. Welcome to Dark Souls.&gt;but I need a quick and fair solution.Cheating is not a fair solution. You have your options, choose which one you prefer. You need to accept the consequences of your actions, intentional or not. If you wanted another example, say you weren't watching where you were walking and walked off of a cliff accidentally, losing 500,000 souls in the process. Do you really think it'd be acceptable, in this case, to say "Well, it was an accident, this is unfair! I'm going to cheat in those souls that I lost!"? It wouldn't be - there are consequences for your actions, and you have to be careful with your actions in Dark Souls. Every action counts. Even unintentional ones. You need to face the consequences for *all* of your actions, deliberate or otherwise, that is what Dark Souls is all about. If you're going to cheat to avoid facing the consequences of your actions, you should quit now, because you'd be missing the point of the game entirely. There is a reason it's possible to kill NPCs, you know. If you're looking for the "quick" solution, Dark Souls is not for you.	0.0

/U/creatron gave you some great advice in the other comment, im commenting here so you dont miss it. Get that skillet as hot as it will go, preheat your oven to 300. Using butter or lard (animal fats into animal cooking, never oils) sear both sides of the steak in your cast iron pan (~3 mm deep). Throw that baby in the oven, and now that you no longer have children: 2 options.Option 1: throw the pan w/steak into the oven.Option 2: place the steak on a drip tray in the oven (above the baby)Your beard will start tingling when it's rare (about 20 minutes, depending on thickness).In the same (unwashed) skillet put in some more of the fat you used, scrape the juices off the bottom and get that baby piping hot again. Throw the steak back in that piping hot fat with some lemon juice (because, have you used acid yet? I didn't think so) to sizzle the finish on it, bonus points if you throw your broiler on highest heat and use that sucker like a salamander to melt the fat on top of the meat.	0.0

I'm confused by your comment completely. I don't think you understood my point. I already addressed people being incapable of making decisions and that they have someone with POA, which is decided by doctors and a court. That has absolutely nothing to do with "when life begins"?I just mean if we spend a bunch of energy arguing over that point, we miss the major point, which is that *even if* abortion is killing a life, it's *bodily autonomy* that matters. I have beliefs about that but the problem is there is little to no way for us to know. And in the grand scheme of things, it *doesnt matter when we are talking about why abortion should be legal*.	0.0

[This happens.](http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/justiz-skandal-deutsche-richterin-rechtfertigt-eheliche-gewalt-mit-koran-a-472849.html)Summary: A married couple with two kids live in Germany, and used to live in Marocco. He beats her and threatens to kill her, so the woman wants to divorce him as fast as possible.The (female) judge denies the fast divorce because *beating the wife is culturaly common in Marocco and a law in the koran*. It doesn't stop there: The judge, after critizising her rule, proclaims the man has the right to beat the woman because the divorce hurt the honor of the man.That's the future they want to live in.	0.0

"ghost of a squad"?  That's laughable. NE will have one of the best front 7's in the entire NFL (top 10, maybe top 5 caliber). Also, while their secondary did get gutted McCourty is still the 2nd best FS in the league and the pass rush that NE will bring to opposing offenses should ease the pressure on the secondary.Even when NE was at their worst in 2011 (Super Bowl year) when they gave up over 6,500 yards, they still tallied 40 sacks and forced 34 turnovers and only gave up 21 points per game.

Boxing is easy to learn and simple techniques for footwork and throwing a punch will make a huge difference in just a few weeks. In my experience, most people have no idea how to fight, and just a basic introduction to any martial art will put you far ahead.There is no doubt that something like Kickboxing is far superior to boxing when it comes to winning a fight or inflicting pain, but it will require more training and dedication to learn, and it's unlikely that it will ever be an issue.When I used to box a few years ago, I sparred with several guys a lot younger and smaller than me, who were fierce, didn't back down and had great technique and those things mean a lot more than strength or range.[Like Tyson said, everyone's got a plan until they get punched in the mouth.](https://youtu.be/6vah91g_FjI?t=35s)	0.0

This is NOT a bucket brigade style vibrato, which is what some of the other suggestions I'm seeing in the thread are. This is a type of phaser: it uses frequency cancellations created by phase shifting to create the vibrato effect.This comes from the Univibe as an optical effect, except the univibe is 4 stages instead of 2 and also has a "chorus" mode that mixes some of the dry signal in a way that doesn't sound like a typical phaser. (MXR makes one that's about the same price in the same size pedal, but it) It's also used in the the Magnatone amp -- and pedals that attempt to recreate that sound -- but not optically.There are also some vibe effects that are literally just a phaser design with the dry path lifted. The Lovepedal pickle vibe is like that: it's a phase 45 minus one resistor. This is also a common mod to the Phase 45. My problem with this is that it retains the triangle wave of the Phase 45, which sounds more obnoxious and unnatural with pitch bending (compared with, say, doing it with your fingers).If you are at all curious as to how the effect works, [this article by RG Keen explains the inner workings of a Univibe](http://www.geofex.com/Article_Folders/univibe/uvfrindx.htm).The Magnavibe is a single-stage version of this effect; it's optical. I have some complaints that I won't really get into here about the design (regarding how it handles bass and the depth control), but it does sound good with the depth way up. This pedal was an optical implementation of an late-90s DIY project called the Wobbletron. It's a sine wave, so it sounds quite natural.CultureJam developed a DIY project called the Duo Vibe that is a two-stage optical thing. Pretty rare PCB though, so not a lot of them floating around out there. This is triangle wave without modification, though, so not my favorite.And not to spam anyone, but I created a (mostly) DIY project called the [Blue Warbler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urK-ihMyvUk), which is an envelope-controlled version of the same effect. (It's two stages now, but the video is still the one-stage version.)	0.0

A good note and props to /u/Pelagine :&gt;Just a note: fostering and adoption are two different things. As long as these children are foster children, their original parents still have un-terminated parental rights, and the state is acting *in loco parentis* in providing the kids with food, shelter and medical care by means of foster parents who are compensated for their expenses.&gt;Foster parents have to negotiate to get foster kids hair cut, or to have them attend church. Deciding that the kids won't be vaccinated is totally outside of their range of responsibility.&gt;There is no civil rights violation here. She's volunteering with a program that has rules for participating. She doesn't like those rules? She doesn't have to participate.&gt;She says that the baby is "our little Christmas baby." But he's not, legally or morally. He's someone else's child, however fucked up they might be, placed in her care temporarily.&gt;Imagine being the biological parent of that child and learning the baby died of a preventable disease while in foster care, because the state didn't insist on the other people in the house being vaccinated against it.Source: former foster mom, now mom through adoption.	0.0

You could be very tongue in cheek and make the two nations also about capitalism vs. communism. Obviously you'd expect the arcane wizards to be capitalistic while the divine monks be communistic, but switch it around and see what develops. A community of communistic wizards, creating for the good of the nation. Clerics and priests being paid directly by congregation members for the privilege of attending their sermons or whatever. It'd make for an interesting twist IMO. As for what the reason why it's a Cold War? The weave. When there are scenes of mass deaths that were caused by magic, the very threads of magic itself begin to warp and disturb in that locale. There used to be a great tiefling empire, but they used blood magic - magic fueled by the culling of life. As a result of that, magic started working slightly differently in their empire. No big deal. But then: A civil war broke out between two noble families because the current emperor died without any heirs or siblings. Magic was used en masse, and a lot of people died. Eventually, a new emperor was established, but he wouldn't last very long. All the death and magic corruption had torn the very threads of magic throughout the capital city and surrounding lands. Holes in reality started appearing, and *things* started coming through. Eldritch abominations, perhaps. They were fought off, but since they kept coming, the capital was abandoned. And thus the empire broke apart completely as these rifts started spreading out and further away. Eventually it was realized the only way to stop the rifts was to have a circle of magick users link up and combine their magic in what would effectively be a huge magical explosion. But since magic itself was corrupted, things thrned out different. Every single living tiefling within the empire's borders... Simply vanished. The rifts were gone and so were any aberrations that had crawled through. But it's been an abandoned, cursed locale ever since. Magic has recovered somewhat in that area, but there are still side effects or *twistings* of spells to make them slightly off. And because of that, the other empires know they must avoid full on magical confrontation at all costs, and there aren't nearly enough mercenaries or whatever to have a purely physical army big enough to wage war with. So they send in elite groups for the purpose of espionage and sabotage. Of course, the empires aren't purely exclusively humans and purely exclusively dragonborns and dwarves. While those may be the majority, there are still plenty of other races in those empires - otherwise the whole espionage thing would fall flat really quickly as a game concept. Sometimes these groups are sent in to retrieve artifacts from dungeons and meet with other groups from the other empire. Just some ideas I had that I think would be cool, based on your post.	0.0

Yes , it's my money and i had 5euro worth of fun , in the end all the 5 bucks go to Valve.That's why i liked how the market used to be.	0.0

There is some truth to this argument, in the sense that over the last 20 years we've rarely had a situation where the NDP are proposing no personal tax increases and the Liberals are for big personal tax increases. Usually it's the other way around.But it's kind of over-simplifying to look at it this way. Mulcair isn't against personal tax increases because he's intrinsically opposed to taxation... it's because he believes pushing the top marginal rate above 50% is (i) not fair, and (ii) won't work anyway. Fairness is a valid left-wing concern. And honestly increasing the top marginal rate to 58.75% in New Brunswick as the Liberals propose is pretty unrealistic without major side effects. It's okay to be left wing and actually have realistic rather than pie-in-the-sky proposals. That's the NDP this election... progressive but realistic.To look at it another way, think about the Ontario situation. Liberal government, quite a few tax increases in the last 12 years, including a new $500k tax bracket. But do you really think on the ground the Ontario Liberals have been all that progressive? It's been all about rewarding insiders and government employees, not providing better services for ordinary people. So many things have been delisted from OHIP. Being progressive is about producing results for average people.	0.0

&gt;By successfully carrying out an attack in India's heart it was able to send a message to demonstrate to India that it can not only hit India but hit them hard. They were able to humiliate RAW by launching an attack in Mumbai for the second time and showing their superiority over Indian intelligence.As I remember, prior to the Mumbai attacks, both governments were talking about trade deals, cultural exchanges, easing on visa processing etc. It was not a war time situation.By arguing that civilians of India are a genuine laboratory for testing future war strategy, you shouldn't be surprised the amount of ill will Indians hold towards your country. Terrorism is easy because it is the terrorist that chooses his target. What kind of a policy is this?Honestly, I don't have anything against you guys here nor with any pakistani citizen. Muslims in India suffer because support base for ISI in India for comes from Muslims. I can tell you, very clearly that people of my extended family can easily be convinced that it's a holy job to kill non-muslims or showing other facts about backwardness of Muslim community and of course Babri Masjid. The issues of India, which are our own, that could be solved with more political activity over a period of time is getting mixed up with foreign policy Pakistan of abetting terrorism in India.We Muslims are loosing the *chance* Indian democracy gives us to solve our problems.

I certainly mean a pack, eg like 20/25 per pack depending on brand. All taxes to discourage smoking, and it works.When I quit about 3yrs ago they were *only* $14 a pack, and at a pack a day, meaning I have saved about $15k since then.http://sincemylastcigarette.com/index.php?month=2&amp;day=2&amp;year=2012&amp;hour=2&amp;minutes=0&amp;amount=20&amp;unit=1&amp;currency=USD&amp;cost=14&amp;submit=1I bought a joyetech kit when i started, nicotine, and a few bottles of juice. Around $150 spend to fully make the switch. I have bought a couple of devices (Evod, MVP2) since then and a couple of tanks (protank3, nautilus)I make my own juice (menthol crystals $20 lasts a whole year), and about 1 Litre of PG/VG a monthDont have to replace coils very often (im talking about 1 per mth) because this liquid doesn't seem to gunk up coils very oftenTo be generous, If I have spent $1k in 3 years, compared to $15k (and rising) that I would have spent.If the $100-200 initial investment is whats stopping you, maybe try and cut down on cigarettes and save up to get started.Edit: a little side note, patches and/or gum was even more expensive than a pack a day and just plain didnt work for me. I tried a couple times to quit using combinations of patches and gum.Over the last couple of years, I have also cut down on the nicotine quite a bit, and I barely put any in the bottle now	0.0

I am sorry! It must have been how I worded what I said. I was trying to say that the way in which you have to use the bathroom now is not how anyone else is required to use the bathroom. So you have every reason to be uncomfortable about it. You deserve to be comfortable using the bathroom at the same level of comfort everyone else experiences. You deserve to be able to use the bathroom the same way everyone else does. Anyone that is not comfortable with you using the bathroom with them has no valid reason for feeling uncomfortable. Like you said them feeling uncomfortable with it would be along the lines of them being in the bathroom with someone they personally do not like. That isn't a valid reason for making you feel uncomfortable by sending in a school official to mandatory clear out the entire bathroom every time you have to use it. Does what I was trying to say make sense now? The website links I provided in another comment have methods to obtain free legal advice. So it may be worth it for you to seek out the advice of a California lawyer on if what the school is doing is discrimination or if it is legal.	0.0

Also, I don't want to scare you or make presumptions about your relationship, but parenthood rattles even the strongest marriage. Often, the only thing keeping me from completely flipping out on my husband is the fact I've committed to being with him -- and we have a GOOD marriage. It's just that hard, with a newborn. If this young man isn't duly committed to you during the newborn phase, chances are that he is going to bounce when in gets tough. Whatever you do, be prepared for that. Commit, at least, to a written agreement with exit clauses and responsibilities should you go your separate ways.	0.0

That's not the way polling works. Going from 5% to 15% (a three times increase) isn't the same as going from 10% to 30%.So, what's a realistic range that a new candidate could pick up against an 'establishment' candidate in an early primary state?We can look at NH, in April Hillary was ahead of Sanders by 50% (55% to 5%), and in the latest poll Sanders is now slightly ahead.

I think its just that Discraft as a company is comfortable with where they are. They have a pretty large share of the ultimate market plus they've been around forever. They have their couple DG pros that stick with them(until recently), plus they have the Ace Race every year which is free publicity. The other newer companies (Trilogy, Prodigy, MVP, etc) all have to build their market share and audience from the ground up. They've done a very good job of it for the most part, but if they wanted to become successful they had to over-market to a degree. I mean just look at MVP/Axiom - their fanbase is as hype-y as it gets. Innova is as well, but that's probably because they release discs at the fastest clip. I mean I know I'm buying a Whale when it comes out even though its proooobably not too much different from my P2 or Nova. Discraft though kinda just do their thing. They release an Ace Race disc every year, maybe one other. I think they'll just keep chugging along until they fall behind Trilogy, which I think they eventually will (already  have? I don't know the numbers)I'm also sure if you talk to /u/3Wheel you'll get a pretty good dose of Discraft hype	0.0

I'm so sick and tired of this argument. Its frustrating that people simply dismiss a superior OS all because they are not willing to adopt to a few simple changes. Yes metro apps suck on a desktop. **But FYI you don't have to use metro apps.** For almost ALL apps there is a metro version and a normal desktop version. In fact, most apps have the typical desktop version (the normal programs that have been around since forever) and not a metro version. If you chose to ignore metro it does not bother you and you will not notice it because everything else is still there. Windows explorer, the typical windows desktop UI, its all there. The only change that really gets in the way initially is the start menu. Yes pressing the start menu on the bottom right opens up the metro interface (or the windows key). But this is an improved version of the old start menu if you are patient with it for a week. Why? All you have to do is press start or windows key and type what you want. Example: Lets say you want to change resolution. Hit the win key and type resolution. I promise you the first two things that come up will be related to the display of your system. This works for almost everything. MS has done a good job with pulling up searches based on keywords.This is both quicker and simpler than searching through the start menu (opening control panel then a few more clicks). This is just hit one key, type then hit enter to get where you want to go. Win 8 being the more efficient OS that it is compared to previous version of windows will do this with files, settings, apps, anything. So try it out. Lets not forget win 8 is lighter, boots faster and arguably runs faster in general for most things. There are not many compatibility issues with older windows programs (I have had very few problems with compatibility, even less than win 7)With that said there are MANY shortcomings up windows 8 (one that particularly pisses me off is hidpi support) but it is better than windows 7 and other predecessors. I'm not a microsoft fanboy. In fact i'd switch to linux the moment gaming/software support becomes just as simple on linux as it is on windows. As a software engineer I have some serious questions about the management that goes on in MS. They seem to be going in opposite directions and trying to purposefully tank the company with some of their products. But windows 8 was not a failure on their part. It was a step in the right direction. Where they failed with windows 8 was marketing and showing people that it has not changed THAT much, it is still the same windows. Most people don't realize that and the change scares people because they associate a learning curve with it.	0.0

Well that's just semantics. You're still implying he is a rapist. I am just pointing out there's no evidence for this and his writing uses a great deal of artistic license.

That seems to be a frustration due to a particular bad macro, which could just have easily come from a function, rather than being due to macros-in-general.

Yes, the Bible is exactly as God intended it to be written. But, that doesn't mean it can't be reduntant in parts, specifically for the purpose of emphasis, as others have mentioned. It regularly says the same thing in different ways, or even the same thing in the same way for emphasis or clarity. Angels singing "Holy, Holy, Holy." for instance, why 3 times, is it 'redundant'? Anyway, in response to your original thought, without diving into the context and Hebrew of it, it could be emphasis, it could mean the difference between his laws, and something like the specific direct commands given to prophets to go do stuff, or something else. I think either of those would be reasonable, though.TLDR; There's nothing wrong with being redundant, God can talk that way if He wants.Edit: Wow, my 3DS was being touchy there. I posted this about 5 times on accident. Humorous considering the talk about redundancy.....	0.0

The occult is like Cocaine. You try it a little, maybe a bump, maybe two, and don't really feel much, I mean there's something, and your all "Eh, what's the hype?" You dismiss it. Then someone brings up Cocaine, and you get a little interested again, and this time, your slight experiences with the first boosts up your high. You "get it." You do a line, Then two.

For people who are curious, I started slowly and the weight loss didn't really pick up until about 6 months ago.I started tracking all my calories using MyFitnessPal, which is really what lead to my total change in eating habits. I went from eating probably 2,500 calories a day to around 1,300. If I knew I was going out for a burger and beer with friends for dinner, I would eat a really light lunch. I never got crazy obsessed about how much I was eating. My appetite gradually shrank and I started eating smaller and smaller portions just because I started to feel full earlier.Things I ate alot:* Piece of wheat toast with natural peanut butter and banana slices* (Lunch) Sandwich on wheat bread with a little chipotle mayo, a little turkey, a little ham, onion, lettuce, spicy mustard* (Sides for lunch) Apple with peanut butter/100 calorie greek yogurt/cheese stick* (Lunch) Thick cut deli slice of ham, with red pepper, onion, spinach, spicy mustard. Roll up the ham and eat like a little wrap. You could make 3 of these for the same calories as one with an actual bread wrap.* (Lunch) Grilled chicken breast, corn, black beans, red onion, on a salad with light salsa ranch dressing* (Dinner) LOTS of grilled chicken. I would grill up 4-5 chicken tenderloins at the begining of the week and just eat them in different things throughout the week. Prepared:   - 'Mexican style': Cumin, garlic powder, chili powder, pepper, onion powder, rub and grill   - 'Italian style': Italian seasonings, basil/oregano, salt and pepperI also started exercising. I played sports in high school but had honestly not exercised in about 3 years. My goal is 3 times a week, 60 minutes in the gym.* 30 minutes elliptical (a co-worker told me once that the only good ellipticals are the ones where your heels don't come off the pedal with every step). I crank this baby up to 13 incline and 13 resistance. * 10 minutes treadmill. I hate running and I've never had any sort of running skills. When I started I couldn't run half a mile without stopping. No shit. Now I do about a mile and then I have to stop, so I'm still working on it. I just feel like an elliptical-only workout is incomplete for some reason.* Squats with medicine ball in the weight room. Butt workouts (not working **:(** ), curls, other arm workouts that I feel like, some abs on the floor some days. I mix it up.I'm at the point in my weight loss where my friends are really starting to notice and it felt really good to see high school friends over holiday break and hear "Wow, have you lost weight?" I've literally dreamed of hearing that my whole life. I was always bigger than all the other girls in my group.  Goal is to lose 10 more before spring break!

[Does he have any regrets? Stewart recounts one big disappointment – an anodyne interview with Donald Rumsfeld in 2011 that failed to claim the former secretary of defence’s scalp. “He just went into the general gobbledegook.” Stewart puts on a pretty good imitation of Rumsfeld: “‘Mnah mnah mnah, well, you have to remember, it was 9/11 mnah mnah.’ I should have pushed, but he’s very adept at deflecting.” He looks genuinely crushed for a moment, then rallies: “That interview with Rumsfeld went shitty, but it’s still just an interview. He’s the one who has to live with the repercussions of what he really did, so there’s nothing that could happen on my show that carries that same level of regret.”](http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/apr/18/jon-stewart-why-i-quit-the-daily-show)	0.0

&gt; Admitting refugees is easier when you are much richer than the refugees,The costs associated with admitting refugees vary in function of the country, yes ?

You may approach the situation differently, but I'm pretty cut and dried about it.I will say, this opinion may be biased by the fact that I am a therapist who works with children and adolescents and thus spends a good portion of my day working with difficult people and teaching them social skills and I have no interest in bringing that work home with me.	0.0

That's why you aren't a cop. Edit: before the downvote rain, let me clarify... Police depts have been proven time and time again to hire lower IQ officers over higher ones. Why? Because lower IQ means able to follow orders better. They then train them to assume anyone is packing heat, and that they are the law, nothing should bother them or threaten them. So when these low IQ thugs see a kid trying to run them over, or a small dog coming at them (whether friendly or not) their first reaction is overwhelmingly going to be to shoot first. Now of course not all cops are like that, but many are. I've know a lot of cops, and certainly none of them are very smart people.	0.0

I don't know how many financial transactions there are on Wall Street, so I'll go with reforming capital gains tax instead ([as it's something he said he'd do](http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Bernie_Sanders_Tax_Reform.htm)). From 2000-2009 capital gains averaged about 4.3% of US GDP - [source](http://taxfoundation.org/article/federal-capital-gains-tax-collections-1954-2009).GDP in 2014 was $18.1 trillion - [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States) - so total Capital gains in the US was probably around $778 billion last year.The current maximum capital gains tax is 20% for the highest tax bracket for any investment longer than 1 year, with the corresponding salary tax rate being 39.6% - [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax_in_the_United_States#Deferment_strategies). Given this information, I imagine that total tax revenue from capital gains in 2014 would be about $155 billion. If this was fixed so that it was taxed at the same rate as salaried income (39.6%), **we'd have an extra $153 billion in tax revenues.** Public university costs on average $36,556 to graduate ($9,139 per year for 4 years - [source](http://www.collegedata.com/cs/content/content_payarticle_tmpl.jhtml?articleId=10064)).There were 3,880,894 people born in 1997 (18 years ago). So, it would cost **$141 billion** to pay for free education for everyone born in the year 1997.Yes, fixing capital gains tax would pay for free university in the US **plus an extra $12 billion**. For healthcare: Single payer would be **cheaper** than the model we have now because the government would be able to implement cost controls instead of what we have now, so we wouldn't have [$15 for one Tylenol](http://www.rd.com/slideshows/wildly-overinflated-hospital-costs/)Edit: selective use of bold for readability	0.0

Es geht nicht darum, zu betonen, dass man gut Englisch kann und auch nicht um die durchschnittlich gute Synchro hier in Deutschland. Das hat damit überhaupt nichts zu tun.

Let's see, he misses a sitter that would've tied the game, turns the ball over (was inexcusable by the way. all the time in the world and he one touches it?) leaving the defense outnumbered for the counter.Sure others were wank like Romero, but Rooney was extra wank. Herrera had a decent game at CAM and created many opportunities so you've lost your plot. You're avoiding the point that Rooney has been shit for ages and doesn't seem to be getting better. And no, scoring 3 vs. a 3rd tier team missing 2/3rds of their starters don't count.	0.0

Just because we can. Not for women, not for anyone's approval, but because it's just plain more fun than being a subsistence loser. Waking up every day, full of energy, looking in the mirror, loving what you see, having goals and ambitions, interests, hobbies, a life.  Feeling...good, even happy, knowing what a badass life you're living. There is absolutely no substitute for that feeling. No pussy in the world is as good as waking up with that feeling. No video game. No alcoholic beverage. No porn. Nothing is as good as that feeling.It's in our nature as men to work hard at shit, shape ourselves with sweat and grit, and feel immense satisfaction as we do so.	0.0

Goldberg vs Hogan was never a bad idea. If you think it was, you don't know how television works. Television isn't just a 2-3 hour commercial for a pay per view. You're supposed to place something on tv compelling to snatch ratings. Higher rating, more advertising dollars. Which is actually the whole point of te lesion to begin with. Honestly, they don't do enough big matches on TV. It's just a broken system now that makes it seem like it's a commercial for the PPV.Now, it's also needs to be noted that Hogan didn't need the belt for the upcoming PPVs, actually they didn't need a draw for the upcoming PPV, because Hogan had the match with DDP and a celebrity coming up. I can't remember if it was Malone or Leno, but Hogan never needed to be champ for that, and Hogan wasn't going to defend at those shows either. Now, when you look at what it did rating wise, and the ticket sales for that show, there's no way it was a bad business move. If there was any bad business move it was not following up on it at a bigger show, because I'm sure a Goldberg v Hogan rematch would have still done great on a PPV.Still, anyone who complains about a big match on television doesn't know what they're talking about. Honestly, as a fan, why the hell are you complaining about seeing a world title match for free? It was a perfect win/win scenario, they pulled in a good rating, got a great crowd, even on short notice, and fans didn't have to pay extra for it. How in the hell is that a bad decision. AND IT HAD NO BAD REPRECUSSIONS! Where on earth do you watch tv and think "this is too good an episode, they should've saved it". Nowhere in TV does that work, but wrestling fans thing a wrestling show on cable should be 3 hours of bullshit. That's stupid, damages the show by pulling in a low rating, and helps the fans in no way.	0.0

&gt;I promise you that if we switched their roles and it was a male strip club and the lead character was female, nobody, especially not her would be saying that it is sexist. that lack of equality is disgusting and sexist in and of itself.Your flip of the scenario is disingenuous, though.First of all, it's completely hypothetical, so you get to pretend she does whatever makes her look worse.  You don't need to argue against her words or actions, you can just **make up** something she **might** do in the land of make-believe and then argue against that.  It's way easier, and that's why strawman arguments are so popular.The other problem is that, again, you're pulling a singular example out of its larger context.  In fact, you strip **several** layers of context from the argument in order to make yours even work.**1.** The example is one of an extremely large number of examples in many high-profile games.  Hitman: Absolution, by itself, is not considered notable or special, it's that it exists within the context of the other examples and thousands of others like it.  For the "male strip club" to even start to be equivalent, it would have to exist in a context where it could be a single example of dozens of examples in high-profile, big-budget games that reflected modern-day attitudes about men.**2.** Of course she wouldn't say it was sexist, **she never argues that any video game is sexist. Ever.**  She has not and will not ever use that terminology because that is not the goal of Feminist Frequency, of the Tropes vs. Women video series, or of Sarkeesian herself.**3.** You argue that it's "only the one level", but that's not really necessarily the case.  You have the heavily sexualized "nun" characters(which get to be targets).  You're also ignoring that these aren't deviations from the norm, but they are the norm.  The game doesn't have female guards and it doesn't have non-sexualized female targets.  Hyper-sexualization that is pleasant from a hetero male perspective is normalized in the Hitman universe because that's what's often used to cheaply and quickly make a fictional crime universe seem edgy.**4.** A video series focusing on problems specific to women doesn't delve into problems specific to men?!  Shocking.	0.0

UK - go look at any recent news on the UK, we're slipping further and further into a police state and every single effort made by the public has done even less than Occupy. Our government has literally gone back on their word in the most *public* way possible. They promised, categorically, if elected they wouldn't increase tuition fees. They then tripled them. We also have numerous examples of police killing people during protests, google Ian Thompson or Mark Duggan.Germany? Police state. They have more CCTV cameras and public surveillance than anywhere else in the world, it's a running joke you can't fart in berlin without three different cameras recording it. Additionally they censor media heavily and respond with increasing violence to protests, despite public demands to back off the censoring.Other countries have pretty much the same problem in lesser extremes. You're incredibly misinformed if you think that somehow european countries are controlled by the public and the gov'ts are afraid of their people. *No one* has a true democracy, we all live in a dictatorship of two or three.	0.0

I've not been to East, but I've been to every Prime and just did my first year enforcing at South, so I can probably help a bit.The crowds will be impressive. You'll be very close to a lot of strangers and may generally feel like you're in a herd of cattle at times. Don't worry, everyone's there for the same reason and 99.9% of folks are super friendly. Some of my best PAX memories came from striking up random conversation with people next to me in line. Talk to whoever you run into. And remember there's always gonna be an enforcer nearby to help out if anything gets weird or scary for you. Just find the weirdos in the red shirts. I know 'em, they're cool. Also there will be an AFK room somewhere which is a quiet space to hang out when/if you're overwhelmed. They've got psychologists in there to help panicking folks, it's really nice.What you go to is really up to what you like to do! I'd suggest getting expo hall out of the way first, since it's usually the most crowded. Tons of stuff to do in there. Lots of sweet loot. Aside from that, have a look through the schedule or the guidebook app for panels that seem interesting, and make yourself a little schedule of where you'll be going based on what theatres they're in. You can follow @pax_lines on twitter for a useful stream of which panels are filling up and when to get in line for things you want to see. Stuff fills up a lot quicker than you'd expect, so it's always best to be early. Sitting in line can be boring but it can be really fun too, with the aforementioned random conversations, plus there's a team of enforcers doing "line entertainment" where they come around with games and such. Win prizes! (Note: Prizes will probably be Magic cards. So many decks of Magic cards...)When it's quiet and you've got nothing better to do hit up one of the freeplay rooms. Tabletop freeplay almost always has groups looking for a spare if you want to join a random game. Smash Bros is also a popular choice. Basically just explore! There's always something cool or weird going on somewhere.As for price ranges... well, I bought a sweater for $50, there's tons of t-shirts at around $20-$30. Also got a purse for $25 and gamecube controllers for Wii U were $20 at one of my exhibitor's booths. Also had headphones, classic games, old systems, dice, wooden moustaches, bowler hats, stuffed toys, jewellery... usually normal swag-ish things seem to cost around $25, I think? Though of course that varies depending on what you want to buy. There were some dudes selling $9,000 tables at South.Hope that helps!	0.0

Maybe try asking people smoking cigs if they'd be down sometime, even if the answers no they probably wont be offended/freak out on you (given that they get a worse rap down here than bud smokers).

&gt; He's playing for Castilla this season, the first team next season and he's good enough to train with the first team now. Most people are expecting at least one or two cameo roles off the bench for the first team in an easy game for the main team this year.Which is why he is setting himself up for failure. Having some games with the second team in the next 3-4 months, followed by basically never playing with the first team in the following seasons, his transfer makes little sense. He will get very few if any chances when promoted to the first team so quickly. Him playing in La Liga is slim and none when a few games can ruin a season plus the chance for winning the league in Spain. They aren't going to risk a 16 year old youngster over their current midfield and unless they open up a huge gap on Barca/Atlético, he will be benched, come in for 5-10 minutes here and there. Him starting in the UCL isn't going to happen until maybe game #5/6 when Real is dominating the league. Him playing CdR games is also only going to happen in the first few rounds, when the competition ramps up as it did this year vs. Atlético, he will be benched. So lets summarize it. He will likely get very very few games, and some minutes when games area already wrapped up and Real has won. What good is that going to do? Real isn't a team where you can easily build yourself as a youngster. You do it in the second team and he will be there for a very short time.This transfer makes little sense for Odegaard. He could have gone to Eredivisie, the Portuguese league, Championship, even lower tier EPL team, etc. Anywhere where he could get weekly playing time to develop, instead of sitting on the bench and looking at other players. He is so far ahead of his peers that sitting and waiting for chances in the main Real team doesn't make sense. Training with the first team is great and all, but it doesn't bring first team experience. Before people start bringing up youngsters developed at Real, look at their playing time with the Castilla team. The majority (Jese, Mata, Negrado, Soldado, Carvajal, etc) played a pretty substantial amount of time for the B team before being promoted or moving on elsewhere. The two main people that skipped the B team relatively quickly were Iker and Raul. Goalies are a bit of an anomaly in terms of age, they can start/peak much earlier and last much longer. Raul is just an unlikely case and something of a one in a thousand type of deal that doesn't come around very often. Skipping quickly to the first team, at 16 when you still aren't developed, on a team that is absolutely stacked, is going to be highly unlikely. When Odegaard could have gone for experience in a low key setting, he seemed to chose the money and the most high profile team in the world. I honestly don't see this working out in the long run. Sure I can be wrong, but the cards are stacked against him based on the past.	0.0

I think it's due to misunderstanding because men's rights had the wrong people leading it for so long or had the wrong people getting all the attention. You know situations where feminists tell you, 'Well not all feminists are that extreme' but people are completely convinced they are because they have a bigger online presence than they do in real life? It's like that, except a bit worse because on Reddit and online those are ALL the people getting the attention. With feminism at least you have a lot of subs and reasonable people to point to. With Men's Rights, you have that awful sub and a lot of bad other sites that are more focused on anti feminism than actually fixing shit for men. Part of this is due to feminism having a several hundred year history while men's rights came into being just in the 60s, the attention hasn't been there plus the population isn't there. It's a lot easier to find a anti feminist than a actual men's rights activist.	0.0

Google Engineer Barnaby James writes on his blog, “skill will allow you to place more bets on the table, but it’s not a guarantee of success.”I wrote about this before. Adam suffers from survivorship bias. Here is the a good video and the blog about it:[YANSS at TEDx: Missing What is Missing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtUCxKsK4xg)[Here is the longer article about Survivorship Bias.](http://youarenotsosmart.com/2013/05/23/survivorship-bias/)This is the general gist:Simply put, survivorship bias is your tendency to focus on survivors instead of whatever you would call a non-survivor depending on the situation. Sometimes that means you tend to focus on the living instead of the dead, or on winners instead of losers, or on successes instead of failures.It is easy to do. After any process that leaves behind survivors, the non-survivors are often destroyed or muted or removed from your view. If failures becomes invisible, then naturally you will pay more attention to successes. Not only do you fail to recognize that what is missing might have held important information, you fail to recognize that there is missing information at all.Survivorship bias also flash-freezes your brain into a state of ignorance from which you believe success is more common than it truly is and therefore you leap to the conclusion that it also must be easier to obtain. You develop a completely inaccurate assessment of reality thanks to a prejudice that grants the tiny number of survivors the privilege of representing the much larger group to which they originally belonged.	0.0

I was curious as well and did a tiny little bit of research. [Out of the approximately 3 millions of legally declared weapons in France](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arme_%C3%A0_feu#Quelques_chiffres_.28.C3.A9valuations.2C_pour_petits_calibres_et_armes_l.C3.A9g.C3.A8res.29), about a third are automatic weapons of some kind. You need a specific permit for those. The rest are more "simple" weapons meant for sport or hunting. [There are officially 1.2 million hunters in France](http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2013/09/08/01016-20130908ARTFIG00024-la-chasse-deuxieme-sport-en-france-apres-le-foot.php), making hunting the second most popular "sport" behind football. I think we tend to forget that France (and I would say Germany as well?) is still a pretty rural country, so the number of weapons is not as surprising as it seems. More worrying, some Swiss institute [made a survey and estimates that there are about 20 millions](http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2008/10/01/combien-d-armes-a-feu-circulent-en-france_1099601_3224.html) undeclared weapons in France alone. Most of those dating from WWII (the undeclared old gun of your grandpa), undelcared weapons kept by collectors or hunters. ["Only" 30 000 of those weapons would actually be used by thugs and criminals](http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2010/12/15/01016-20101215ARTFIG00731-30000-armes-illegales-circulent-dans-les-banlieues.php), 4 000 of which being war weapons.

If it is the latter, you might want to consider wearing something underneath it to give it a little more shape.	0.0

Sorry if this is a silly question but I have an off brand "Carson RP300" reflector scope (it was free) it has a 114mm aperture and a 900mm focal length. I also have a 20mm and 9mm eyepiece.

Your example isn't valid, try another. King Diamond's entire gimmick is Satan worship. How about Dio? He had songs that were both "light" and"dark". My issue is with the entirety of the "are they dark enough" argument because it's wholly subjective. Personally I think Nick Cave wrote one of the darkest songs ever but someone who listens to Norwegian Black Metal would try to stone me out of the subreddit. Dark and heavy are terms that have been horribly misused by the kvlt crowd, while I enjoy that genre I do not think that they have the monopoly on those descriptive terms. I don't think you are making that particular argument, I was pointing out your mistake.	0.0

Perhaps you need a break from watching the grumps so that you can get back to enjoying it?  As for the "what's the point" part of your post, yeah all the really good stuff gets animated, but there's something to be said for the chill discussions and sharing of stories on grumps too.

I'm not really well versed in this MU, but here are some things that in my opinion could be of great help, or at least worth trying:As far as I know Din's only has a single hitbox when traveling, another one when stopping, one when on standby, one when exploding, one when returning and one extra for every "pulse" the Zelda does when it's returning. What you want to take advantage of are the travelling, stopped and returning hitboxes. A hitbox can only ever hit one character once. Therefore, if one of these hitboxes hits you, the Din's cannot touch you until it has progressed to it's next phase. This is why you want to either shield to wavedash towards or CC to dash towards through the traveling or standby hitboxes or, even better, clank them, so that you get between the Zelda and the Din's. BUT DON'T JUST RUSH IN RIGHT AFTER!! Nayru's love is a very good get-off-me, but it has a lot of endlag. You want to chill outside Zelda's threat zone baiting for a hasty Nayru's to punish and possibly even pressure with aura spheres, because what can Zelda really do to combat that? Her speed is shit so you can react if she comes rushing at you. She can't really escape above either because she is so slow. She has no projectile because her Din's is away and calling it back will give you a chance to get in. Remember to be on the look out for spaced fairs and bairs. Teleports may be a problem, but only if she uses them for escaping. If she uses them as an attack you can CC to ridiculous %. If she waits for the Din's to come back I guess you'll just have to rush in unpredictably before it reaches you. I guess you could also try getting behind her with down b, so that the Din's doesn't really threaten you anymore. And of course, you being a Lucario, everything will in the end come down to how good your punishes are. Anyway, this strategy is pretty much theory crafting and is probably very difficult to pull off. Do try though. Also I think getting the Zelda airborne into upair cancelled into up-b cancelled into upair may be a very early kill combo in low stages.	0.0

Why would anyone waste a roster spot on a player that you know wont be here next year instead of someone who potentially might be? It's idiotic.	0.0

I didn't equate Muslims with terrorists. Acknowledging that most terrorists in this time span are muslims is not the same as saying most muslims are terrorist btw.

You're not talking with facts - you're dismissing me as a fanboi (despite the fact that I agreed with you on the early adoption stuff).You seem to think that Valve is supposed to be a game development studio - but they aren't. They are a publisher and they develop game technologies - supporting the Half Life engine, Steam and all of it's associated technologies, and many others. It's not so cut and dried as you would like to claim.Yes, there is a lot of trash on Steam, but that's how a market works. At least gamers now have a platform by which they can spend their money to try indie products and Indie developers have a central market where they can try to get recognized. It's not perfect, but it's better than anyone else has done. Or maybe you'd have GarageGames driving that train? Because they're done so much more for the industry than Valve.No private company is without sin - but Valve's soul is a whole lot cleaner than EA or Activision. If you don't want to recognize that there is a difference, then there's no point in even having a discussion.Also, for all you have done to conflate these issues, you haven't offered a single alternative that you think would be better for consumers, producers, or the industry in general.	0.0

&gt; Teslas aren't known for their interior quality, in fact it pretty much pales to the offerings from German luxury carmakers.Seeing as the Tesla is far cheaper than anything but the cheapest C class, that kind of makes sense.They did a documented test, I don't remember what program it was for, but they measured every stop etc.My point was that it can easily be done. And not only that, they saved a ton of money, so when they finally arrived at their destination, they could afford to spend more money on actually enjoying themselves. A few nice meals, a better hotel, etc etc.&gt;It doesn't work that way in the US. If you stop at a charger in the middle of bumfuck nowhere Kansas, you're gonna be bored out of your skull.But why would you have an EV in Kansas? You're literally grabbing one of the least populated states in the US, and one of the areas in the developed world with the absolute least density.I think it's fairly established that bumfuck nowhere isn't where EVs are trying to be sold - luckily that disqualifies the vast majority of people in developed nations.But even so, 30 minutes in the French, Spanish, British, New England, California, or Ohio nature seems fine to me. You get out, stretch your legs, get the blood pumping, use the bathroom, maybe grab a cup of joe and a bite - and then the 30 mins are over.	0.0

Have you seen a Volt commercial in the past few years?  I think there was one TV commercial when the Volt fist came out that dissed the Leaf, but I haven't seen another one since.  No advertising on TV, Radio, magazine, newspaper, nothing on the internet.  When I was shopping for mine, none of the dealers I talked to knew anything about the car, and were quick to tell me that.  One salesman tried his dammedness to steer me to a convertible Camaro.  GM has done no marketing for the Volt whatsoever.  People don't know how the car works.  The only press it gets is bad press about battery fires, failed batteries, and government handouts.  GM doesn't seem to respond to these negative stories at all.I've had my 2013 for a year and a half, put almost 25,000 miles on it, and I've not had any problems with it.My biggest complaints are:1. The clunky interface for radio and climate controls.  I'm used to it now, but it's poorly designed.  This could be fixed with a software update, if GM wanted to.2. I've been a Sirius subscriber since the first month the service began in 2002.  The Sirius/XM radio reception on the Volt is the worst I've ever had.  It's quite annoying.  Yes, I've changed the antenna.3. I wish that Sport Mode was normal mode, and Normal Mode was economy mode.  Or I wish that Sport Mode was sticky and the car remained in Sport Mode when I turn the car off and turn it back on.  I wish it remained in Sport Mode when I put it in Hold Mode, and Mountain Mode.  I never drive the car in Normal Mode.  I'm always in Sport Mode, unless I have to be in Hold or Mountain.	0.0
