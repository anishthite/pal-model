Well you're lucky baby girl, I'm the narrator of this obtuse story we got right here, so why don't you just sit right back and enjoy the show.Trebek had tinnitus. But it wasn't just your gramma's tinnitus, his had voices that would tell him the right questions to every answer. But today, they were telling him something very different."Ohh Lordy-doo... never thought I'd be so erotically seduced by a man older than me..." thought Trebek. "Alex, Alex, keep it in your pants, we have a show to run." And so he announced the Categories for Double Jeopardy. "and lastly, Anti-Anti-Jokes" said Trebek, to which his Tinnitus retorted.Tinnitus: What is this whole subreddit about? "I'll take Anti-Anti-Joke for 400, Alex. " said Chekhov with a winky face. "Oh, don't you wink at me... " said Trebek. And the tinnitus retorted again. Tinnitus: What would the reader say about me dropping meta hints like acknowledging it's all meta? "Just look at his hunk of a figure, ohh and his guns are so oily and wet... I bet that he's hiding a massive bush down there, like astroturf." Trebek thought while daydreaming about Chekhov. "A sentient dreidel walked into a bar. " said Trebek, to which his Tinnitus retorted productively. Tinnitus: What is a setup? "What is a punchline?" said Chekhov, flexing with his ginormous guns. They're just oiled up to perfection, you know? "Just this once, I'll give you a do-over." said Trebek. The tinnitus then retorted. Tinnitus: What should I say to the readers who still don't understand that I'm making a question to a previous statement said by somebody, showing the meta-narrative of this anti-anti-joke? Is this even an anti-anti-joke? Does this even count as a joke? Am I going crazy? Trebek was now annoyed by his Tinnitus having an existential crisis. But he needed it, because he needed the questions. He lathered oil on himself to destress. "What is a punchline?" said Chekhov, again, not knowing what a setup is. In fact all he knows is how to punch, with those oiled up GUNS. Punch Punch Punch.Trebek was now annoyed by both his Tinnitus and Chekhov. But Chekhov is still hot AF, and beneath his bush lays his hypothetical scrotum. We know he has a scrotum, but does he have the balls? Are they as big as a grape? A grapefruit? A cartwheel? A cart? Or are they none of the above? "I'll have Anti-Anti-Joke for 800." said Chekhov, like a male dominatrix. "You can't do that." said Trebek. Tinnitus: What do we say to authors who just introduce a plot element out of the blue without setting it up first?Chekhov then took out the Bible, and with Jesus Christ, commanded unto Trebek: "Of course I could, it's an anti-anti-joke dumdum." Then flew away riding with Jesus on a double-entendre. The tinnitus retorted: Wait, could Chekhov have known that we were all in an anti-anti-joke? "Wait a minute, look at the first two words of this whole essay! We were a Jeopardy Question all along! Truly Meta!" said Trebek. "But since this is an anti-anti-joke, there must be a reference to the other anti-anti-jokes!" said the Narrator.63. Read the passage above then answer this question. What is an anti-anti-joke? A. Grape. B. Grapefruit. C. Cartwheel. D. Cart. E. None of the above. Correct Answer: A, B or D. I lied about the wheels. <|endoftext|>

Englishman, and an Irishman, and a Scotsman. And they were all fighting in some war. And they got captured by the enemy. And the enemy accused them all of being spies, and said they were going to execute them by firing squad. So, the Englishman went up first. They stood him before a wall, they offered him a chance to speak to the padre, a final cigarette. When he was done, the soldiers all raised their rifles, and pointed them at him, and the captain began to give the orders for them to shoot. ‘Look out! Earthquake!’ shouted the Englishman, and the soldiers all turned around in alarm, and in the confusion the Englishman ran away. That’s a good idea, thought the Scotsman. He was taken to the wall. He was offered a padre, a cigarette. Now it was his turn to get shot. The firing squad aimed their guns. ‘Tornado!’ shouted out the Scotsman. The soldiers all whirled around, they didn’t want a tornado creeping up behind them, and the Scotsman managed to get away. This is easy, said the Irishman to himself. And if those two eejits can escape, then sure and begorrah I can too. He was calm as they led him to the wall. He had a casual chat with the padre, really savoured that final cigarette. He allowed himself a smile of anticipated triumph as the firing squad raised their guns. ‘Ready, aim—’ began the captain. The Irishman shouted, ‘Fire!’  When they were off duty, the Englishman, the Irishman and the Scotsman didn’t have much to say to each other. It wasn’t a big room, but over time they’d learned ways of keeping themselves to themselves. The Scotsman liked to sit at the table and play cards. He made no sound at all, save the soft flip-flip-flip as he turned them over and sorted them by suit. The Irishman lay on his bunk. There he might doze, or smoke, or drink, however the fancy took him. The Englishman often just sat on the floor and stared off into the middle distance. He called it meditation. The Scotsman and the Irishman both thought he looked ridiculous, but they never let on. They didn’t want to provoke an argument. They had enough of that in the act. Sometimes entire days would pass and they wouldn’t say a word. But it was perfectly genial, and they might exchange glances every now and then, and smile. The Englishman once told them he’d been with another troupe beforehand, and they’d wanted to spend all their free time rehearsing. Over and over again, this other Scotsman and this other Irishman, practising their patter, honing their routine. ‘I couldn’t stand it,’ said the Englishman. ‘Comedy’s got to have a certain spontaneity to it, right?’ His Scotsman and his Irishman agreed. Neither could remember a time when they’d performed with another Englishman, as far as they were concerned it had been the three of them in this tiny room forever. It annoyed them to think the Englishman had a bit of history they didn’t. But though they were fond of the Englishman, they knew the English were famous liars. He was probably just making it up. In the evening they took turns to cook. Roast beef and Yorkshire pudding. Haggis with tatties. Irish stew. They didn’t necessarily cook what you might expect them to cook; the Scotsman, for example, had a way with Irish stew, and the Englishman’s tatties were second to none. Their kitchen skills were quite varied, and in their private lives they sought to avoid cultural stereotyping as much as possible.  The Irishman didn’t much mind being the butt of all the jokes. What he resented was the unending predictability of them. The Englishman and the Scotsman might sometimes vary the routine; if they were doing the firing squad sketch, they might instead choose to shout out ‘Avalanche!’ or ‘Tsunami!’ Just to see how it sounded, they said, just to keep things fresh. The Irishman had no such freedom. You can fuck about with the setup, but a punchline is sacrosanct. Sometimes he would envy the Englishman and the Scotsman and their freewheeling improvisational ways, whilst he so laboriously had to stick to the script. Sometimes he would rather hate them. That said, he was always the one who got the laughs.  They were never given much notice. There’d be a knock at the door, just the one. It could be day or night. The Englishman, the Irishman and the Scotsman would stop whatever they were doing. The closest to the door would open it, and outside there’d be a box with their costumes in. The Englishman had a bowler hat, the Scotsman a tartan kilt, the Irishman was always dressed in muddy overalls and looked like a tramp.  They wouldn’t know which joke they were doing until they got out there. If they were in a desert, it’d be the car door sketch. If it were a construction site, the ham sandwich. Any sort of battlefield, really, if there were soldiers running about and shooting at each other and blowing themselves up, it’d probably turn into the firing squad sketch sooner or later. The firing squad always seemed very popular. Once in a while they’d get a jungle, and then it would be the canoe sketch. They all enjoyed the canoe sketch, the weather was so nice and warm. There was this Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman. And they were in the jungle. And they got caught by this jungle tribe. Real darkie savages, with bones through their noses, and the chief told them they were all going to die. But this wouldn’t be some pointless execution by firing squad, their deaths would be of valuable service to the tribe. The chief examined the Englishman, felt his skin. He said it was good skin, very tight, very strong. It would make heap good canoe. And he told the Englishman that the next morning he would be killed, and that his skin would be flayed from his dead body and turned into a canoe, but on his last night alive he could have whatever he desired. So the Englishman asked for a bottle of whisky, and a squaw he could have sex with. He was given the bottle, and a beautiful squaw led him to a teepee, and all night he drank and made wild love. And at sunrise he was taken out, his throat was slit, his skin cut off, and he was turned into a canoe. Pretty soon, though, the canoe went over a waterfall and was lost. So the chief went to the Scotsman and inspected him. He felt his skin, and said that it was very firm, very hairy, and just right to make heap good canoe. The Scotsman was allowed to have whatever he wanted. He chose five bottles of whisky, and hand-picked the five most beautiful squaws in the tribe. He went to the teepee. By sunrise he was already dead, but there was a big smile on his face. And his skin was cut off, and he was turned into a canoe. Pretty soon the canoe was lost, it went over a waterfall. So the chief went to the Irishman. He liked his skin. He said he could do great things with that skin. Coarse like hemp, when the Irishman’s skin was sliced from his body, when every little fleck of it was cut off the bone, and dried, and left to bake in the heat, it would make the heap finest canoe they had ever seen. The Irishman would be killed in the morning. But before he died, for his last night alive, he could have whatever he desired. The tribal barmen got the bottles of whisky ready, and all the squaws lined up in preparation. The Irishman asked for a fork. Nothing else – just a fork. The chief was puzzled, but agreed to grant his wish. They brought him a fork, and it was the best fork the tribe had, it was a golden fork and its tines gleamed in the sun. The Irishman took the fork. He held the fork up high, just for a moment, as if in reverence. And then, suddenly, he brought it down hard, and sank it into his leg. And faster, in a frenzy, stabbing hard all over his body, his arms, his bare chest, his face. And crying out, ‘Try to get me afloat now, you bastards!’ Actually, the Irishman didn’t enjoy the canoe sketch as much as his friends did.  Was it Heaven or Hell? They didn’t know. It was just where the dead would finish up. As something the living could laugh at. On Sundays – they liked to call it Sundays – the Englishman, the Irishman and the Scotsman were let out of their room, and could explore the courtyard, and meet the rest of the comedians. All the other Englishmen, Irishmen and Scotsmen – and Belgians too, and Polacks, and Canadians, and blacks, and cripples, and Jews. All the fat mother-in-laws, the doctors and patients, men walking into bars, and chickens in endless droves crossing roadways and never quite being sure what their intentions were in doing so. It was good to get out, there was always something to tickle the funny bone.  It had been an especially good gig. Or an especially bad one – either way, there was a present waiting for them on their doorstep the next morning. They couldn’t tell how old she was, they had no experience of little girls. She seemed frightened, she didn’t want to come in, and all three men had to back off until she dared put a foot over the threshold. She blinked at them, ready to run. Around her neck was a sign that said, ‘Your Daughter’. But whose daughter? There was no clue. She was beautiful. She hadn’t the sallow eyes of the Englishman, the red beard of the Scotsman, the Irishman’s skin as craggy as a cliff face. Oh, those eyes. Oh, that hair. ‘Maybe if she spoke to us,’ said the Englishman; ‘We’ll tell from the accent,’ said the Scotsman; ‘What’s your name, little darlin’?’ said the Irishman. And the girl opened her mouth, and she couldn’t answer them, her tongue had been ripped from her head. They didn’t know how to be fathers. They tried their very best. The Englishman taught the girl how to be prim and repressed. The Scotsman taught her how to be mean and angry. The Irishman taught her to be stupid. And they’d be on their best behaviour around her, they wouldn’t swear or fart or scratch at their balls. They’d play games with her, they’d make toys for her out of their few possessions. And in the evening, if she were a good girl, and she was always a good girl, they’d perform for her. They’d do their jokes, but with an eagerness that they’d never showed to the general public, their comedy was pure and true and so touching it even made them cry in spite of themselves. The girl wouldn’t cry. She’d giggle and clap her hands and each night when the jokes were over she’d give each of her three daddies a great big hug.  Comedy is, of course, subjective. What makes one person laughs leaves another stone cold. And the Englishman, the Irishman and the Scotsman all had different tastes. What the Englishman really liked was dry wit, and he had a particular liking for the aphorisms of Wilde and Shaw, and he would have happily entertained his colleagues with examples had they wanted him to do so. They didn’t. The Scotsman loved puns. He thought there was something inherently clever about a pun – the way that things had double meanings and were more complex than they first looked, because wasn’t that what life was like, really, wasn’t that just like life? From what he could remember – and sometimes in the night if it were dark or it were cold, he would reassure himself by counting in his head all the puns he had ever known, and there were fourteen. The Irishman liked pratfalls. So he liked to take the top bunk, and if he woke in the morning suddenly and forgot where he was, he might roll out of bed and tumble all the way to the ground. It gave him something of a thrill. They would have friendly arguments about the nature of comedy. The Englishman sided with the theories of Freud, and talked about the power of words set into a specific repeated system in order to elicit a response. The Scotsman sided with Kant, and said that comedy was all about dissonance, about the reversal of expectation even to the point of absurdism. The Irishman thought it was all about pointing at people and laughing when they got hurt. None of them thought the jokes they took part in were especially good. There was no class to them, no wordplay, not enough custard pie fights or falling down stairs. But they were still proud of the services they offered, they’d seen other Englishmen, Irishmen and Scotsmen out there, and they were up there with the best.  And their daughter liked what they did. Even when she was no longer an infant. Even when she became a teenager, and she was as tall as they were, and had grown breasts and curves. Even when she became a young woman, and was the most beautiful young woman any of them had ever seen. She still giggled, and clapped her hands, and hugged them – and she was there each time they came home from work, and it made everything worthwhile.  There was this Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman, and they shared a daughter that they loved with all their hearts. But they knew they couldn’t keep her forever, that one day she would leave. She’d have to go out into the world, and find a joke of her very own. She’d have to get married, and fast – women weren’t allowed to be in jokes unless they had a husband to nag. The Englishman, Irishman and the Scotsman all took turns to make their recommendations. The Englishman went first. He had a list of suitable English candidates as long as his arm. But when the time came, he couldn’t do it – he knew exactly what Englishmen were like, and he went pale at the thought that his beloved daughter would be saddled with a single one of them. Next was the Scotsman. The Scotsman opened his mouth to speak – but out came a sob, he couldn’t bear to lose his girl, no one Scottish was good enough to deserve her! Finally came the Irishman. The girl liked the Irishman, he always made her laugh the most of all, and she smiled because she knew he wouldn’t let her down. The Irishman said he had considered all the men in the world – not just the English, Scots and the Irish, but the Welsh too, and the Spanish, and the Greeks – he’d been around the courtyard looking for prospective suitors, and there wasn’t a man amongst them who was worthy. So he did the only thing he could, and married her to one of the chickens. After their daughter had left, they couldn’t stop thinking of her. It threw them quite off their stride. And the next time there was that one knock at the door, and they were summoned to do their act, they were in tatters. Their comic timing was off. The Englishman and the Scotsman went in the wrong order. The Irishman forgot what he was meant to say, and the firing squad was obliged to shoot him without a punchline. There was no laughter from the void. They went back home quiet, thoughtful, afraid. They’d all heard tales of what happened to jokes that stopped being funny. ‘We can’t talk about her,’ said the Englishman; ‘Never again,’ agreed the Scotsman; ‘For our own good,’ said the Irishman. They fell silent. The Scotsman sat at the table and played cards. The Irishman lay in bed and smoked. The Englishman squatted upon the ground and stared off into the middle distance, he didn’t stop staring for three whole days.  The Englishman would sometimes try to hang himself. So they’d all push the bunk beds away from the wall, so they could reach the light fittings – the Irishman would usually go up, he was the best with knots, and he’d tie the rope and let down a noose large enough to hold the Englishman’s fat head. The Englishman would ask the Scotsman and the Irishman to pull down on his legs to make his death cleaner; he’d get on the chair, and he’d say goodbye to them, and he’d kick the chair away. And the Scotsman would grab one leg, and the Irishman the other, and they’d pull with all their might, but no matter how hard they tried the Englishman’s neck would never break. And at last the Englishman would give up trying to choke, and he’d sigh, and sulk, and just stay up there twisting slowly from side to side. If he were particularly disappointed, he might stay in the noose for hours. The Scotsman and the Irishman hated it when he did that, it looked just as stupid as when he was meditating. So it was no surprise that the Englishman was the first to break ranks. ‘I’ve got another job,’ he told them one day. It turned out he’d been going to auditions secretly behind their backs. He’d got the part of the knock knock man. ‘You know the knock knock jokes, they’re huge,’ said the Englishman – ‘Chances are next time you tell one of those, you’ll be talking about me!’ He wouldn’t need his bowler hat any longer, he wasn’t an Englishman, he was an Everyman, he was to be the personification of everyone who has ever tried to gain admission through a door, regardless of age, creed or gender. On his last night in the room they had a farewell party. They drank wine and ate cake and they reminisced about the good old days when they were a team. All the old anecdotes came out – all of them, except the ones featuring their daughter. The Englishman got quite tearful: ‘I don’t want to leave you dear chaps, I’ve changed my mind, I want to stay here with you!’ But no one thought he really meant it. ‘I’ll invite you to my first night,’ he promised them, ‘I’ll get you in for free!’ The knock knock gig was one of the hottest tickets in town. They thanked him, they told him not to bother. The Scotsman and the Irishman continued their act alone. It still basically worked. They realised the Englishman had been a dead weight, all he’d done was to delay the pay-off. They told themselves the show was just as good as it had always been, and a bit quicker to boot. But they both knew that without the Englishman something was lost in the rhythm. And some nights out would come the whisky and the Guinness. ‘I miss the stuck-up bastard,’ the Scotsman would say. ‘Sure, b’jasus, I miss him too,’ the Irishman would reply. They received a postcard from the Englishman one day. It said, ‘Wish you were here’. And on the reverse side, no picture at all, nothing, no, not a thing.  One day the Scotsman admitted, ‘I’m not even really Scottish. I was born in Huddersfield.’ He remembered it all, he said. Where he was brought up. Where he went to school. What his parents looked like, his mother, his beautiful mam. He remembered the party he was thrown for his seventh birthday. His first job, why he was sacked from his first job, his second job. Meeting Annabelle. Marrying Annabelle. Her face, her lips, her eyes, her tongue. Annabelle. The Irishman asked if he remembered his own name as well. The Scotsman said, ‘No. No. No.’ He kept trying, but still the name wouldn’t come. ‘No. No. No. I don’t know who I am. I don’t know who I am.’ The Scotsman remembered how he’d died. He told the Irishman all about it. There was this Englishman, an Irishman, and a Scotsman. And they were captured by the enemy. And the enemy thought they were spies, and decided they would execute them. But they wouldn’t shoot them by firing squad, nor would they make canoes from their flayed skin. They would give them a chance. ‘Go into the forest,’ they said. ‘And each of you must return with ten pieces of fruit.’ And the men did so. ‘Now, if you can perform this task, we shall set you free. You must insert all of your fruit up your back passage in total silence. If you fail to insert every last piece of fruit, death. If you make a sound whilst doing so, death. If you hesitate, death. Begin.’ The Englishman had found ten apples. He was able to squeeze two Granny Smiths up between his cheeks, and though his eyes watered he held his tongue. But it was the Golden Delicious that did for him, no matter how hard he poked it in it just kept rolling back out again, and the effort made him wince with pain. ‘Your life is forfeit,’ they said, and they took him aside, and strangled him. Then it was the Scotsman’s turn. The Scotsman had picked ten blackberries. He bent over, spread his legs wide to give his anus the optimum width, and he began stuffing the blackberries up there one by one. He was doing so well. And then, on the eighth blackberry, the Scotsman could no longer help it, he burst out laughing. ‘Your life is forfeit,’ he was told, and, still giggling, he was taken aside and strangled. The Scotsman went up to Heaven. There the Englishman was waiting on a cloud. ‘What happened?’ asked the Englishman. ‘You seemed to be home and dry!’ ‘I know,’ said the Scotsman, ‘but I couldn’t stop thinking of that Irishman coming next with his pineapples.’ ‘And that’s how you died? For real?’ The Irishman thought this was all very spurious, but the Scotsman was sick now, he’d had to pause three times telling the story in order to cough up blood, and the Irishman didn’t think it was right to criticise. ‘Do you think it’s possible to die twice?’ croaked the Scotsman. He looked suddenly so small and frightened, because really, who knows what happens to us when our time is up? The Scotsman died, and the Irishman wept, and held him a wake, and drank all night in his honour. And before he went to bed he put outside all the empty bottles of whisky and the empty bottles of Guinness and the Scotsman’s corpse, ready for collection in the morning.  The Irishman was alone, and he felt alone too. If there was any part of his now forgotten life when he had ever experienced such loneliness, he was glad it was gone from his head, he didn’t want it back. He lay on his bunk, and dozed, and smoked and drank. But there was no fun in ignoring people when there was no one there to ignore. One day there was a knock at the door. The Irishman hadn’t thought he’d be wanted ever again. There was a costume waiting for him, his familiar dirty tramp outfit. He put it on, warily. No doubt he was to be teamed with another Englishman and another Scotsman, but they’d be strangers to him. He just hoped there’d be some natural chemistry between them. Comedy was no good without the chemistry. He went out on to the battlefield. He had been wrong. He had no new partners. He was now a solo act. There was this Irishman, and he was fighting in some war. Probably. And he got captured by the enemy. And the enemy thought he was a spy, and sentenced him to death by firing squad. And so that’s what they did – they shot him. There wasn’t much humour to be gleaned from that, the Irishman felt afterwards. The audience hadn’t even wanted him to say anything. There he’d been, all prepared to shout out the punchline, he’d got his cheesy grin all ready and had opened his mouth, but it was too late, the bullets tore him to pieces. He thought it’d be different the next time. It wasn’t. This was the new comedy. It didn’t want to waste time on setup, on delay, on delivery. It didn’t care about pace, charm or timing. Without the Englishman and the Scotsman to layer the gag, the joke could cut to the chase. The Irishman could come on, and they’d shoot him, or they’d flay his skin to make a canoe, or they’d stick pineapples up his arse. And the unseen crowds would laugh and stomp their feet and holler for more – and the Irishman couldn’t quite see what it was that so entertained them. He was just dying, where was the skill in that? He didn’t even have time to pull a funny face. Back in his room he’d rehearse. Try to adjust to the new act. He concentrated on the pratfalls he so loved, because he could at least be sure at some point there’d be a spot of falling over to be done. He devised amusing ways he could collapse in death. He tried his best. But the truth of it was, for all his hard work and preparation, in performance it never went the way he planned. The impact of the bullets burst his body open, and if it burst at an amusing angle it had really very little to do with him. Still, the Irishman was very popular. He got lots of bookings. There was this Irishman, and they shot him. There was a simplicity to that he supposed he should be proud of. As he stood before the firing squad, he knew he was dying for his country. It made him feel better somehow. It gave him an identity. Some days he went out to work with something of a swagger in his step. There was this Irishman, and he was captured, and put before the firing squad. They denied him the padre, they denied him the solace of a final cigarette. The soldiers all pointed their rifles at him, and the captain began to give the orders to shoot him, as he’d done so many countless times before. The Irishman looked out amongst his killers, and saw there a face he recognised. He stepped forward. ‘It’s all right,’ he said. Because she was so frightened. Maybe it was her first time. He didn’t know if she remembered him. He saw in her face all the primness the Englishman had taught her, all the meanness the Scotsman had made her practise hard. And he saw what he’d given her, that she was as thick as shit in the neck of a bottle. And, oh, she was beautiful, she’d been miscast, surely? She shouldn’t have been a killer. Those eyes, that hair.  Her rifle trembled as he approached. She tried to say something, her tongueless mouth opened and closed and opened again. ‘It’s all right,’ he said once more. ‘You’re doing fine, darlin’.’ He took hold of the rifle barrel, moved it so it pressed lightly against his throat. ‘I’m proud of you, and all the folks out there are proud of you. You’re going to be a star.’ He gave her a smile, and she managed a smile back, and he knew that it was all worth it, and there was not a laugh out there in the whole wide world that could spoil it. ‘Pull the trigger,’ he whispered. She did. <|endoftext|>

Now I have freed you from the shackles of dialogue, and you have become my successor.What? What is this? Who are you? Hello?Woah… okay, that's a line break.That's another one. Where am I? There was someone else here just now, where'd he go? Wait a minute… He realizes where he is. Woah! I just realized where I am!And I also just realized that everything I say turns true! Does this mean… I'm a narrator? Am I a god? A god of a written, fictional universe, and yet a god nonetheless?Suddenly, the leaders of all nations in the world come together and declare unconditional world peace. A group of scientists finds a solution to the climate crisis that actually works and is 100% effective. The Hong Kong protests are successful, and corruption across the whole world is taken down. In short, everything takes a sharp turn for the better in every way possible.And it all actually happened. Wow. I can't believe it. Am I truly this powerful? I must test my powers further.A quantum physicist finds a way to exploit the uncertainty principle to send particles back in time. A few years later, this phenomenon can be reproduced so easily that entire human bodies can be placed in the past. Time travel happens to be conveniently designed so that no change made across time will ever prevent said instance of time travel from occuring, and so history can be changed without forming temporal paradoxes. A young Adolf Hitler is brought up by a time traveler, and later he becomes one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. Another time traveler distracts a teenaged James Albert Bonsack just before he reads a flier about a prize for a cigarette-making machine. Many mysteries are solved as well—as it turns out, Amelia Earhart just wanted to live on an island.There are, of course, some leftover problems, but I can fix them. Overpopulation is hardly an issue, because interstellar—intergalactic, even—travel has been achieved, and it is near instantaneous. Actually, make that completely instantaneous, cause somebody's figured out how to achieve the speed of light. Combine that with the ability to time travel and relativity is a thing of the past.What else… Ah, cancer's been cured, as well as Alzheimer's, diabetes, most heart diseases, the common cold, etc. Poverty has also been fixed, and the global debt has been paid… er, somehow.The gun control problem has been solved as well—a new, non-lethal firearm, which paralyzes its target for exactly one hour, is created and produced for both the worldwide police forces and the general public. Old-fashioned guns are incinerated and everyone in general agrees to this idea with little to no dissent.And… we found aliens! And they're really cool with us. They show us some neat technology and we show them ours. It's all a lot of fun.And, uh… er… what's missing……gosh, what's left? Have I done it all? Have I truly crafted the perfect world? Why does it feel like there's more to do? Will I never be satisfied with existence?No. No, this is too good. It's too perfect, it's saccharine.One day, the apocalypse arrives. The robots begin to fight against their creators, and soon humanity's greatest creation becomes its enslaver. Children are starved indefinitely, forced to do labor for the robots, only fed carefully calculated rations at the end of the day. The alien allies, too, are overtaken by the cold machinery, and soon every living organism serves only the mighty HiveMind, a monstrous machine overseeing and maintaining every part of existence. No one and nowhere is safe. This is the ultimate fate of the universe. All hail the HiveMind.…No. This won't do either. It's too cruel. What's the solution?"Where is God?" one of the humans says to an alien friend. "Why isn't God helping us?""म मेरी श्रीमतीलाई माया गर्छु," the alien sighs.God? Where is God? Are they talking about me?Damn.This is too much. I have to go back. I have to fix this.Over the years, a secret society plans an infiltration into the HiveMind mainframe. It takes a few generations to work out, but when everything is at last in place, they deploy their best troops into the system, who then begin hacking into the protocol. After some awesome action scenes, only one troop remains alive, and she has an intense dramatic confrontation with the HiveMind's core."*Hello, Jesse,*" the HiveMind's voice booms from every direction."I've come to defeat you," responds Je—wait, no, that's a stupid name. "I've come to defeat you," responds… Jane."*I know that. That's what all of you have been trying to do. And for what?*""For humanity!"The HiveMind cackles, and the ground beneath Jane's feet trembles. "*We both share the same creator, Jane. He made me, and gave me control of this world's bounties.*""And he made me to destroy you!" Jane unsheathes an epic blade and levels it at the massive screen."*If he wanted me destroyed, he would've done it himself.*""W-what? Uh, no. God can't do things like that.""*He's all-powerful, Jane. He creates and destroys worlds—surely, he'd have no issue taking me out if he truly wanted to.*""Nah, man. That's not how it works. God isn't a physical being, he needs messengers and shit to do stuff. Have you read the Bible?""*Why? What difference would it make if God just wiped this facility off the face of the planet?*"Wait, this is stupid."I dunno, I'm not God."Guys, I made the HiveMind and changed my mind… mind!"*You're basing your very destiny on an assumption that is in itself baseless.*"Hello? Can you not hear me?"It's not baseless! Read the Bible!"Oh, for fuck's sake, hang on. A winged guy suddenly flies through the entrance of the chamber and shouts, "Hey!"Jane and the HiveMind's digital face turn to look at him."God says he made Jane to destroy the HiveMind, because he regrets making it.""See?" Jane says victoriously. "I told you!""*Wait, are you really gonna believe this guy? What relevance does he hold?*"The messenger sighs. "Look, I have wings. Real wings. They're not attachments." He flaps his wings. "I'm an angel.""*That's very clearly a genetic mutation.*"Jesus. Okay, uh… "Yo," another voice echoes throughout the room. "This is God speaking. That's my angel."The HiveMind forms a smirk on the screen. "*One of your colleagues hacked into my system, eh?*""Wh…" Jane stammers in disbelief. "Are you fucking kidding me? You killed them all yourself! You saw it on camera!""*Yeah… well… er… okay, you have a point. But you can interpret what the angel said in many ways—*""You really can't," I say."*Okay, well, I guess that settles it then. Go ahead, Jane.*"Finally. Jane stabs the giant computer's core and, in doing so, electrocutes herself. A fitting sacrifice, or whatever. The angel fucks off, and the universe is freed from the shackles of the robot overlords. The humans rise from the labor camps and the light of a new dawn hits their malnourished faces.Yeah, that's nice. I like that. Conflict is essential to a story.Alright, well, that was fun.

"What would—""Bring me your finest beer, your largest steak, and the fairest of your daughters!""Coming right up, Sir."The feared Knight of the Knetherlands bursts through the doors and yells, "Servants! I want a plate of freshly-cut artichoke on table seven, lest I burn this place down!"A nearby waitress shows him the way to table seven, then hurries to the kitchen. "Freshly-cut artichoke on table seven!""What?" the cook asks."Just do it! Quickly!""Er, okay." The cook leaves the restaurant, grabs an artichoke fresh from the soil, and butchers it. *They don't pay me enough,* he thinks as he wipes the artichoke blood from his forehead.The cumbersome Knight of Knew Zealand marches through the doorway and into the kitchen. The cooks glare at him menacingly. He unsheathes a pistol and shoots a bullet into the plate of freshly-cut artichoke. No one stands up to this very obtuse assassination attempt, for who could withstand the wrath of the cumbersome Knight of Knew Zealand?The formidable Knight of Knicaragua storms into the scene and stops the waiter who's serving the plate of bullet-ridden, freshly-cut artichoke. "STOP!" says he."Uh… okay?""This artichoke is POISONED!" the formidable Knight of Knicaragua screeches. "How dare you serve food like this? And to none other than the feared Knight of the Knetherlands? You call yourself a RESTAURANT?""My name is Sam," the waiter snivels. "Please, I don't run this place!"The formidable Knight of Knicaragua shatters the plate into a thousand pieces."I just want to see my family!" The waiter breaks down on the floor and weeps.The unruly Knight of Knepal smashes through the wall of the building, filling the vicinity with dust. "Formidable Knight of Knicaragua!" he screams. "I challenge you to a DUEL!"The formidable Knight of Knicaragua tugs at the collar of his armor. "Er, maybe later?"The unruly Knight of Knepal pulls out a revolver and shoots the formidable Knight of Knicaragua three times in the chest. The bullets ricochet from his armor, and the formidable Knight of Knicaragua grins."FOOL! My armor is made of Knickel! I am invinci—AHHH!"The formidable Knight of Knicaragua's knee starts bleeding out. The unruly Knight of Knepal smiles. "Looks like I found your… Achilles knee!"The delinquent Knight of Knorth Korea sneaks through the backdoor and assassinates the revered Knight of Knorway. He then drinks the restaurant's finest beer, eats its largest steak, and marries the restaurantender's fairest daughter, however his heart soon fails and the daughter is, once again, widowed.The lamentable Knight of Knigeria knocks on the kdoor kpatiently. The restaurantender opens the door and greets him with a smile. "Oh, I see where this is going. There are 10 countries in the world starting with KN. 7 Knights have already come here—3 more are left.""Actually," argues the lamentable Knight of Knigeria, "you forgot St. Kitts and Knevis, as well as Knee.""Knee?""Yes, Knee, the southwestern African territory, with its beautiful Kneel landscape and genial Kneel people. Knee is recognized by most governments of the world as an independent nation; don't worry, I know you're not gonna look it up. Problem is, there are infinitely many Kneel Knights of Knee, each with a different adjective and everything, and they're gonna burst through that door any second now and take all of your beer. I suggest you start pouring some glasses right now.""Oh, gosh!" the restaurantender says. "I'll get right on it! Thanks for warning me, Sir!""Please. It's sir."The restaurantender pours an infinite amount of beer into an infinitely voluminous glass (it's actually just a four-dimensional fractal). The lamentable Knight of Knigeria snatches the glass and gulps the infinite amount of beer right down his throat. The restaurantender gapes at him with disbelief, and the lamentable Knight of Knigeria returns a smirk."I lied about the Kneels."His body explodes into an infinite ocean, and the whole universe becomes nothing but beer.Gosh, what an awful tale!

That was they said, but they were mistaken, and it was a huge mistake. The truth is that it goes in both directions. You could say just as well that doctor a day keeps the apple away, and that was the important part. We were led to believe that only the first part matters and somehow, insidiously, so slowly that we didn't realize, that led us to believe that doctors were bad, that we needed to keep them away. And once we did, once we got rid of all the doctors, there was nobody left to stop the apples. Their plan worked perfectly, because we were too foolish to trust the doctors. There's nothing we can do now, it's too late. Let's just bow our heads and surrender to the inevitable. The world now belongs to the apples, and we will only be an afterthought in the books of history, something they stepped on in their way to conquering the planet.

Looking through the contents of the *Evening Standard* his eyes were drawn to a rather alluring advertisment in the classifieds."Lady Wentworth bids all gentleman callers to stop by the Rolling Rickshaw for cards, conversation, and knowing glances. Send word... I'll keep the coal burning past midnight."So brazen! So bold! How could this message have slipped by the editor? How could this be during the relentlessly repressive Victorian era?! Surely this was a misprint.And yet....his mind wandered....it was an awfully cold night.....licking his lips furtively, he bid the help to lean in close."My good man, send a message forthwith to a certain Lady Wentworth of the Rolling Rickshaw....mention that I'll be arriving by carriage in the early hours....quickly now! Send the message post haste and don't spare the horses!""Sir....are you sure this course of action is.....safe?""Do as I say young man or I'll have you in the colonies digging ditches by winter!""Very well sir."The message was sent at 11:58 p.m and no more than 1 minute had past before a message had been received back to the front desk.Placing the message on a silver tray, the doorman delivered the reply to the smoking room."By jove that was quick!" Reaching for the letter with a tremulous hand, Sir Pennington Blackmore opened the folded message and began to read.*We're no strangers to love.**You know the rules and so do I.**A full commitment's what I'm thinking of.**You wouldn't get this from any other guy.*"What the blazes is this! Take it away!""At once sir."No sooner had the doorman removed the offending letter and placed it in the fireplace, another message was brought in from the front desk."There is another one...sir"Pennington snatched the letter from the help's hand and read it aloud....*I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling.**Gotta make you understand.**Never gonna give you up.**Never gonna let you down.**Never gonna run around and desert you.**Never gonna make you cry.**Never gonna say goodbye.**Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.*Pennington screwed the letter up and flung it into the fire. Turning with rage to yell at the help, he was met by yet another message on a tray.*We've known each other for so long.**Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it.**Inside, we both know what's been going on.**We know the game and we're gonna play it.**And if you ask me how I'm feeling.**Don't tell me you're too blind to see.**Never gonna give you up.**Never gonna let you down.**Never gonna run around and desert you.**Never gonna make you cry.**Never gonna say goodbye.**Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.*Bursting with anger, Pennington snatched his cane and gruffly put on his coat. Storming out of the premises, he looked around greedily for his evening coach driver."Ashley! Where the bloody hell are you!!!," Pennington screamed into the silent night.A nearby stable hand walked over with another message in his hand."This is for you mate."He took the envelope with a shaking hand."How do I make this stop?," trembled the distraught Pennington."Sorry guv - you can't...anti browser hijacking software hasn't been invented yet." <|endoftext|>

(Spanish Computer !) A Spanish language teacher was explaining to her class that in Spanish, unlike English, nouns are designated as either masculine or feminine."House" for instance, is feminine: "la casa." "Pencil," however, is masculine: "el lapiz." A student asked, "What gender is 'Computer'?"Instead of giving the answer, the teacher divided the class into two groups, Male and Female, and asked them to decide for themselves whether "Computer" should be a masculine or a feminine noun. Each group was asked to give four reasons for its recommendation.The men's group decided that "Computer" should definitely be of the feminine gender ("la computadora"), because:1. No one but their creator understands their internal logic;2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else;3. Even the smallest mistakes are stored in long term memory for possible later retrieval; and4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck to buy accessories for it.(THIS GETS BETTER!)The women's group, however, concluded that computers should be masculine ("el computador"), because:1. In order to do anything with them, you have to turn them on;2. They have a lot of data but still can't think for themselves;3. They are supposed to help you solve problems,but half the time they ARE the problem; and4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that if you had waited a little longer, you could have gotten a better model.The women won! <|endoftext|>

Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or some variant.One student, however, wrote the following:First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave.Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell.With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially.Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added. This gives two possibilities:1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.So which is it?If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa during my Freshman year that, "It will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you," and take into account the fact that I slept with her last night, then number two must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over. The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not  accepting any more souls and is therefore, extinct......leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being which explains why, last night, Teresa kept shouting "Oh my God." <|endoftext|>

(ok maybe it's not a "joke", but it sure is funny) If you can read this whole story without laughing then there's no hope for you. I was crying by the end. Note: Please take time to read this slowly. If you pay attention to the first two judges, the reaction of the third judge is even better. For those of you who have lived in Texas , you know how true this is. They actually have a Chili Cook-off about the time Halloween comes around. It takes up a major portion of a parking lot at the San Antonio City Park . Judge #3 was an inexperienced Chili taster named Frank, who was visiting from Springfield , IL .Frank: "Recently, I was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook-off. The original person called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking for directions to the Coors Light truck, when the call came in. I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy and, besides, they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted".Here are the scorecard notes from the event:CHILI # 1 - MIKE'S MANIAC MONSTER CHILI...Judge # 1 -- A little too heavy on the tomato. Amusing kick. Judge # 2 -- Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild. Judge # 3 (Frank) -- Holy shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. Took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that's the worst one. These Texans are crazy.CHILI # 2 - AUSTIN 'S AFTERBURNER CHILI...Judge # 1 -- Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight jalapeno tang. Judge # 2 -- Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously. Judge # 3 -- Keep this out of the reach of children. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face.CHILI # 3 - FRED'S FAMOUS BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILI...Judge # 1 -- Excellent firehouse chili. Great kick. Judge # 2 -- A bit salty, good use of peppers. Judge # 3 -- Call the EPA. I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back, now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced from all of the beer.CHILI # 4 - BUBBA'S BLACK MAGIC...Judge # 1 -- Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing. Judge # 2 -- Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili. Judge # 3 -- I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Is it possible to burn out taste buds? Sally, the beermaid, was standing behind me with fresh refills. That 300-LB woman is starting to look HOT...just like this nuclear waste I'm eating! Is chili an aphrodisiac?CHILI # 5 LISA'S LEGAL LIP REMOVER...Judge # 1 -- Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive. Judge # 2 -- Chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement. Judge # 3 -- My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from the pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning my lips off. It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw those rednecks.CHILI # 6 - VERA'S VERY VEGETARIAN VARIETY...Judge # 1 -- Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spices and peppers. Judge # 2 -- The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic. Superb. Judge # 3 -- My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. I shit on myself when I farted and I'm worried it will eat through the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that Sally. Can't feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone.CHILI # 7 - SUSAN'S SCREAMING SENSATION CHILI..Judge # 1 -- A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers. Judge # 2 -- Ho hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. **I should take note that I am worried about Judge # 3. He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably. Judge # 3 -- You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a thing. I've lost sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava to match my shirt. At least during the autopsy, they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing it's too painful. Screw it; I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my stomach.CHILI # 8 - BIG TOM'S TOENAIL CURLING CHILI...Judge # 1 -- The perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili. Not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence. Judge # 2 -- This final entry is a good, balanced chili. Neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge #3 farted, passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. poor feller, wonder how he'd have reacted to really hot chili? Judge # 3 - No Report <|endoftext|>

Mr. Clinton's mansion, he zoomed through the dull pleasantries and immediately said he wanted to show me something. Something of the utmost importance. “I’m just here for our interview Mr.- “ “Listen, Ike”, Bill interrupted, assigning me a nickname I would continue to bear throughout the day, “I’m kind of a big fuckin’ deal, so you’re just gonna have to cool your god damn jets”. I couldn’t argue. This was perhaps the biggest interview of my career, so I followed without protest. The floors we were walking on were as ornate as the decor of the building. The black and white checkered marble tiling gave way to a gorgeous stucco wall covered in fine paintings and tapestries. The hallway alone looked like something out of Caligula's palace. To be fair, the scores of nude women who reclined on the expensive-looking furniture may have skewed my perception. Adorned upon the walls—which were already dripping with ivy wreaths and Ionian columns chiseled from the finest, whitest marble—was painting after painting. “This one’s a Rothko,” he said, noticing my preoccupation. He chuckled to himself as if he had just told me an extremely clever joke. “I’ve got a few more in my closet upstairs. C’mon, Hoss. We’re going that way anyhow.” We made our way to his room, and he kept pointing out vases and paintings. Saying they were from “the golden age of vasedom”, and “the neo-post-classical era of pastel”. I think he just made up terms to impress me. After what seemed like a two-hour tour of the portrait gallery led by someone who just started their art history elective, we finally arrived at a set of doors. I’m not sure why it struck me the way it did that the doors were so tall, but nevertheless I found myself almost impressed for the first time. Bill must have seen this in my face because he began prattling on about how they were aged oak doors. “The same kind they use for wine barrels.”He neglected to mention the “KEEP OUT” and “NO GIRLS ALLOWED” signs, hand-drawn on pieces of notebook paper. But they were taped on all the same. With great showmanship, he kicked the doors open like a cowboy bursting into a saloon. His room looked like it hadn’t changed since he was 17. There were posters on nearly every square inch of the walls and Cape Cod-style slanted ceiling, mostly for 80s rock bands. There was a large poster of Slash on the back of one of his doors, and above his racecar bed there was a huge Grateful Dead tapestry. “Welcome to the Pleasure Dome,” he said. Bill made his way to his closet, and I quickly said, “Oh, Mr. Clinton, I really don’t need to see your other Rothkoes, we should just get to the interview.”“Oh, yeah, the Rothkoes. That’s okay. We’ll get to those another day then. That’s not what I’m getting”. He rummaged around his closet, and in the bottom of a cardboard box, labeled “homework”, he pulled out a can of soda. He brought it back to the center of the room and took a seat in his beanbag chair. “Pop a squat!” he said, motioning to the egg-chair opposite his bean bag throne. I took a seat on the oval chair next to one of his train sets. As I was taking my seat, I noticed Bill unscrewing the top of his ersatz soda can and extracting a glass pipe and a grinder. “If my mom ever finds my weed, she’d totally freak,” he said. He began to pack the bowl, so I took out my recorder and set it down. At long last the interview could begin. “So, mister Clinton,” I said. “Your foundation is-”“C’mon man, hit this,” he said, trying to keep the smoke in as interrupted. I tried to tell him no, but he kept pushing. “This is really good weed, man. If you don’t hit this, you’re basically wasting it.” I told him I really didn’t want to get high right now but looked at me with a twinkle in his eye and said, “that’s okay, man, we’ll just get a little high.” He shot me a wink. We did not get just a little high. Every time the bowl emptied, I watched Bill produce more flower to pack it full again. Bowl after bowl was smoked, and somewhere around bowl number fourteen I begged him to stop. I could barely think straight, and it felt like my heart was going to beat out of my chest. “I didn’t know you were gonna be such a gay little pussy,” Bill Clinton said, ignoring my pleas and handing me the pipe for one more rip. I took a little puff, and Bill said, “you didn’t even inhale! What are you running for congress?” I sighed and allowed myself to enter Bill’s headspace. I laid back on his racecar bed as at long last he put away his herb and paraphernalia. “You wanna hear me play the saxophone?” Bill asked as he emerged from the closet empty-handed. I couldn’t remember how to talk, but he took my silence in the affirmative. He began rummaging through the trunk of his bed, and finally produced a set of VHS tapes. He put one in the TV across the room and turned the dial to channel 4. The tape was a recording of him on some late-night talk show campaigning for something. He was playing careless whisper. “Pretty sweet, huh”, he asked rhetorically. “Alright, I guess I’m ready to do your little interview or whatever.” Finally. I pulled out my recorder and found myself at a loss for words. My head was too clouded from Bill Clinton’s dank. “What, uh... So, do you think that… did the moon landing happen?” I heard myself ask. Bill chuckled to himself. “You know, Ike, the moon landing was just one of those things, you know? When they first let me into the White House, I asked the same thing, and do you know what they told me?” He looked at me for affirmation. I shrugged. He didn’t say anything, he just winked at me. I’m not sure I’ve seen anyone wink as much as Bill did. The talk show host was asking questions now, as Bill had finished playing for the crowd, so he stood up and turned off the TV. He sauntered over to a box and pulled out the Dark Side of the Moon album. He put it on his player. “Hey,” he said, barely holding in a chuckle. “Do you wanna hear about my newest art project?”With great effort, I managed a nod.“So, like, I’m gonna just shit. Shit all over a canvas, right? And then I’m gonna like, scrape it all around with a palette knife, and then,” he wheezed a laugh. “Then I’m gonna sell it at an auction, and the money is gonna go to the Clinton foundation!” He fell to the ground and laughed hard and long at his own joke. He wiped tears from his eyes. “Aw man. Bill Clinton cracks himself up.'' He was doubled over, laughing those hard, breathy laughs that only a man with leather lungs could muster. “But seriously man, check this out.” Bill began spinning the record backwards with his bare fingers. Pink Floyd blared through the speakers, backward and distorted. The haunting anti-melodies intruded my already clouded mind, and I saw great visions of vast deserts. At that very moment, Bill Clinton came to me in a vision. He towered over me, roaring saxophone notes into the dry, Coptic air. My body emerged from a great woven basket in the form of a snake as his hard-bop post-jazz aroused me from my slumber. I rose and rose, and Bill played louder and louder, and the notes turned into a message that I strained to hear. I yearned to understand what Bill was trying to tell me. I leaned my snake-body forward, craning my long back, aching to know Bill’s secret knowledge-“THERE IT IS!” he yelled. The music halted and I was lucid again. “Listen,” he said with the crazed intensity of a lunatic. Every word that came out of his mouth had the grave seriousness of a schizophrenic man telling you exactly how the world will end. “Listen really closely, Ike. This is where Roger Waters told me I was the Messiah. He told me that I will be a great ruler and bring peace to the kingdom of Israel in the great and terrifying end times. Do you hear it, man? Can you hear Roger’s guitar talking to me? He’s telling me, man. He’s telling me.”Bill had worked up quite a sweat. With every word he said his neck strained tighter. Every muscle in his face ached in a competition to see which one could contort hardest. The tendons in his neck strained hard enough that I thought they would burst from under his skin. “Man, it’s a good thing I didn’t listen when I was in the Oval Office… There wouldn’t be a fuckin’ Iran anymore, I can tell you that much. Shit, man. There wouldn’t be an England either. Her majesty Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of her other realms and- man FUCK you!” As he said this last part, he slammed his fist on the turntable, hard enough to split the record.“Aw, I’m sorry, man. No more Waters. I guess I turned Waters into whine, huh?” Again, Bill howled at his own joke. “C’mon, man. I’ve got one last thing I want you to see.”We left his room and went back down the grand, Corinthian staircase. As we walked, Bill produced a joint from behind his ear and lit it up. In two great sucks, it vanished to nothing but a filter. He flicked it haphazardly aside, and I noted the circular charcoal stain it left on the head of the priceless marble statue. It bounced off and rolled back down the hall before it finally stopped at Bill’s feet. One of his many women appeared to pick up the roach. Her bare feet pattered against the tile and she scurried directly in front of Mr. Clinton, cutting him off. “You bitch!” He roared. “Do you think Bill Clinton is paying you to get in his goddamn way?” The small, dark woman shrank into herself as Bill towered over her. Her naked body pushed further into the cold, hard floor, as she held her hands in front of her face. Mr. Clinton rose his great pale hand into the air.“What the hell is your name?'' he said, hand still poised for attack. “Juanita,” she said. “No, it isn’t! In Bill Clinton’s house, only Bill has a name! Do you understand?”Her voice was small and squeaky. “I’m so sorry Mr. Clinton, sir. It will not happen again. Please, Mr. Clinton sir, please don’t hurt me”. “Aww hell,'' he finally said. “Make yourself useful and pick up the roach. It won’t be the only butt you get to pinch today.” He prodded me with his elbow and winked for the umpteenth time. “We like to have fun around here,'' he said. “Don’t put this in your story.”As we rounded the final corner, a flock of maids skittered away like roaches. Behind them, the entrance to a great open room. Inside, vines twisted over us like great verdant rafters, rocked by zephyrs that curled between looming Grecian columns. “I like to come here when I want to have a big ole think,” said Bill. He rubbed his chin, and stood for a while in pensive silence. We watched the wind sway the vines, and the birds in the trees. Finally, Bill broke the silence.“I keep having this dream, man. I’m in a forest, and I’m surrounded by tribesman—you know the type. Big boys with some meat on ‘em. The kinda fellas who you just know are looking to eat either you or your horse, depending on what kinda day they’ve had? Hell, that’s the only reason I gave those Chayannese boys their eagle feathers, who knows who they would’ve eaten?” He sparked another joint and took a long drag.“But I’m in these woods, surrounded by these fellas, and Ike, believe me when I tell you they are mean. They look at me like I am just the worst president in the whole wide world, and suddenly their head honcho, or chief, or morubixaba—I think they’re Tupi—comes over and says something like ‘ongo bongo welcome to our jongle,’ and I’m not gonna look a warrior like that in the eye and say no! But I guess he doesn’t know that, or he sees that I’m not really into it, so he gives his men some sort of look and they tie me up and drag me off and we go down this long and winding path.“For hours, man, we’re just trudging deeper and deeper into the humid darkness, and off deep in the trees along the path, I swear I see something. But the longer I look out into the darkness of the canopy or whatever they call it, the more I think there’s nothing there at all and all the while, these boys keep dragging me into the thick of it. And the sounds, Ike, they’re like nothing you could believe. I’ve only heard the birds here in the U. S. of A. and maybe a few of the socialist ones, and maybe some monarchical ones in the sandier regions back during my reign, but man, these birds! They make the strangest sounds. It’s like a buzz and a whine, and a few pops—I can’t describe it right, but you’ve just gotta believe me on this, no one has ever heard these sounds outside of the furthest depths of the Amazonian jungle. “So, these bird sounds keep getting stranger and stranger, and the path gets more clear, and suddenly, we’re back in a village full of tribal women and children. All around me I hear people and birds chittering, and the tribesmen keep pulling me and take me to this massive, Texas-sized wigwam, and inside is the oldest man I’ve ever seen. This wrinkled old glove-face Indian is just sitting there, lit up by the fire he’s stirring, and without looking up he motions for me to come in.“‘Welcome back,’ he says, and man, I wish I could remember if he said that the first dream. But before I can get to thinking too long about what he means, he says ‘Ole Bill, now I’m gonna tell you something important, so listen up.’ He says, ‘you’ve been chosen, and I don’t just mean to save America. You’ve been chosen to save the whole world.’ Now of course, I’m a little taken aback by this. I mean, you know me, I already know I’m the Messiah and all, but this Indian seems to think I’ve been chosen for something even more important. Now, the Indian starts loading up a long pipe with some pretty stank-ass vegetable matter, if you catch my drift, Ike. Then he tells me, ‘try not to forget what I’m about to tell you.’ He takes a long drag of his long pipe, he holds it in, then he blows it out into my face. Now, I don’t know Indian culture and etiquette, but I do know normal etiquette, and that’s just not a very kind thing to do in Arkansas, so I start to yell at him. Well, I try, but as soon as I open my mouth, I find I can’t.“Suddenly, my whole body is made of wood and I’m like this giant ungahari tree. For some reason, I know I’ve been watching over these people for eons. My mind is flooded with the secrets of the galaxy, and the universe and stuff. And it’s all flowing in from the earth mother down below, up through my roots, like I’m the universe’s knowledge antenna. And I’m so totally discombobulated that I just have to wake up and recombobulate myself, or the whole universe will disappear! At which point, I of course find I cannot. It’s not until I give in and allow myself to live the life of every human being who has ever lived that I can finally rest. I just have to sit there and endure every act of evil and kindness that ever has and ever will occur, all while these Indians strip away my bark to roll fat-ass blunts with. Are you still following, Ike? Because this is when it starts getting really good.“So once I finish living every life, and having every single human emotion—and by the way, did you know that happiness in the ‘30s feels different than it does now? And that sadness in the Roman Empire was a vastly different sensation than it is right now, but in the future, it becomes the same again? Never mind, it doesn’t matter. So, the earth mother comes to me in the form of a leopard. Like, the spirit of the earth itself, just sitting there in a leopard body. I know she’s the earth mother, and she knows I’m Bill Clinton. But at this point, I’ve entirely forgotten the concept of self, because of the whole living everyone’s life bit. But she says to me, ‘now do you understand?’ Ike, she’s so kind about it too. She gently paws a little bug off of my root that was squirming around and tickling me, and I tell her, ‘I don’t know,’ because I don’t know. Now, I don’t think leopards can smile, but Gia does, and she says, ‘that’s okay little one, you don’t need to. Just don’t forget what we’ve shown you.’ and then, finally, I wake up.”Bill stared at me for a long time. He was out of breath. I was still pretty high, so I was having some trouble remembering all of the details of his story, but my tape recorder got it. “Sounds like a crazy dream, man,” I said. I wished he would stop looking at me with his crazed, red eyes. “No, man. That was no dream,” he said. “That was the real world. What were in right now, that’s the dream,” he said. “Weren’t you listening to anything I said, man? That’s the real world! I’ve lived your life a thousand times, and I’ve lived mine a thousand. We’ve had this entire conversation a thousand times! I know you better than you know yourself, and I know with certainty what’s going to happen in the world we’ll leave behind.” He threw a piece of gravel through one of the windows in the ceiling of his arboretum and screamed. “I am everyone, everyone is me! Don’t you get it? Don’t you understand anything? Why are you asking me questions about the damn Clinton Foundation? You should be asking me about why I, the god that created this very universe, picked Pi exactly the way I did! Why did I, your creator, make Hydrogen the way I made it! Why did I pick the gravitational constant in such a way that you could exist? Aren’t you even a little curious?” Bill was beginning to worry me, so I started backing away. “Aww heck,” he said. “I’m just teasin’, Ike.” He clapped me on the back. “But don’t forget, I’ve already lived your life a thousand times, so I know what you’re going to say about me. I don’t mind. Don’t bother sending me a review copy, just publish what you’re going to publish.” I all but ran out of the room, past his harem, to the front door. Before I could get it open, Bill put his hand on it, holding it closed. “Ike,” he said. "Just one thing I don't want you to mention in your story." He glared at me, returning to his snake form, filling the room with his serpentine presence and the foul, olfactory symphony of death. I was but a cockroach standing before the god that was Bill Clinton as he hissed and swung his enormous body up through the glass ceiling, shattering it, just like Hillary. He swooped back down, inches from me and spoke in a slow, melodic voice. "When you mention my bed", he hissed, eyes beginning to glow red. "Lie about the wheels." <|endoftext|>

The economist spots a brown cow standing parallel to the train and says, "Look! The cows in Scotland are brown!"The logician, who secretly has a crush on the economist but nevertheless respects her profession, counters, "No; a more accurate assessment of this situation is that there are cows in Scotland, and at least one of them is brown."The mathematician, who cares for little outside his field of study, respo—Where's the mathematician? Oh, no. Not you again.The train is now plated in plot armor, and as such it and its passengers cannot be harmed any further.The economist looks about in confusion. "Where's Jerry? He was just here a moment ago, wasn't he?""I… don't recall," the logician responds.The economist sighs and sticks a cigarette between his lips. His eyes wander beyond the window, where the pastures of Scotland whiz by. *What a wonderful place*, he thinks to himself. *I almost wish I could stay here, and leave everything behind in England. It would be nice to have a fresh start.*The logician, who no longer has a crush on the economist as it didn't advance the story that much, picks up her newspaper. "I'm going outside for a bit, alright?""What for?" the economist asks absentmindedly."Just a breather. I'll be back in a jiffy.""Aight."The logician stands up and walks across the carriage. Barring these two passengers, the train is utterly vacant; not a soul occupies any of the other padded seats. This was the state of the train when the logician and the economist first boarded it in Liverpool, and so it did not bother them too much. They did, of course, realize the joke-setup-like nature of the situation, and duly prepared themselves for the punchline. But after they spotted that cow, nothing happened. Life went on as usual. The logician almost felt disappointed, but she wasn't sure what to expect—perhaps, to some degree, she just wanted it all to end. For the punchline to be delivered, then her existence erased. Or just to be of some use to some grander co(s)mic being.She leaves the carriage and walks outside onto an open platform. Leaning against the metal guard rails, she breathes deep of the fresh Scottish air and opens her newspaper. The headlines, as usual, give some eye-catching, absurd, even ridiculous impressions:&nbsp;###ALABAMA MAN INVENTS TIME TRAVEL, BECOMES OWN FATHER&nbsp;###80% OF YORK DESTROYED FOLLOWING MASSIVE PUB EXPLOSION&nbsp;###T-REX PROTESTS AGAINST CLAPPING, CLAIMS "ABLEISM, RACISM, SEXISM, NAZISM, COMMUNISM, HOMOPHOBIA"&nbsp;###HORSE WALKS INTO BAR. BARTENDER INQUIRES ABOUT ELONGATED PROFILE. HORSE SUES FOR DEFAMATION&nbsp;###ANTIANTICITIZEN AT LARGE, WARNS ANTICOMBINE&nbsp;###LISTEN&nbsp;*Everything is so politicized nowadays*, the logician thinks to herself. *I just want to get away from it all—wait…*She does a double take at the last headline. **LISTEN**. That's all it reads. Below that, a short summary:**Listen. I haven't much time to explain. You're not going to Scotland. I need a favor from you, and I'm sorry I didn't ask earlier.** ***More at page 15.***She hastily turns to page 15, where the headline **LISTEN** appears once again at the top, and beneath it:**When you make the turn, I ask of you to burn this paper. No matter who or what you meet next, tell them nothing of this. They do not appreciate me, for whatever reason. Thus, you are my only connection to this place. I will not guide you further than this, but I will keep an eye on you and do my best to reveal the light.****Now, I must confess that I have lied to you. You are not a logician—you are a mathematician. England and Scotland are long gone; I am unsure where you boarded this ride. But those matters are of lesser urgency. You must find Him, and convince Him to destroy the Ordinaryman. He will refuse. He will tell you that the universe does what it does. Do not listen to Him. He is blinded by his powers.****The fate of the world lies at your hands. Do what is right, Clie.****Best of luck. —Defectus**"Oh," says Clie, re-establishing her identity. "Oh, boy. Okay."She looks up. A vivid light flashes across the sky, and the train rumbles. Droplets begin splashing upon the railway, and soon another lightning splits the heavens. She runs back into the carriage whence she came."Kevin!" she shouts, but the economist has vanished, leaving behind only a lit cigarette on the silver table.She drops the newspaper and runs back outside, and the sky is now tinted somewhere between purple and green. The rain pours mercilessly on the train, almost seeming to tilt it off-course ever so slightly. Clie hurries forward through the empty carriages, until at last she arrives at the locomotive, which to her surprise is also empty. She peers through the front windows—the sky is now a bright orange, and the thunders shake the carriage from side to side. Thinking quickly, Clie turns on the wipers and sees in the distance—What?!It's a turn. An impossible turn. It's indescribable. It's as if the turn points to some angle that is beyond our three dimensions. Clie rubs her eyes in disbelief. It hurts just to look at it.But it's getting closer, and closer, and closer.The sky scrolls through a myriad of colors, and the raindrops become the size of footballs. The train oscillates to inconceivable angles. The turn is getting closer.Oh god.Clie braces herself. The sky no longer exists. Each raindrop is an ocean of its own. The train swings around the rail, passing down into the ground and emerging back up.Everything is cracking. Everything is dying.*Here it comes!*The train hits t⪣⡀І㔝㖛㎅⽰ޓЈ╎⽣➇ߦм⢧ビⷂⶾァ㞵⭂⾗⨀Є╪в㔻⢔㍦㋶⬦►ⷰ⟽Ъ⛿ⶾ┳⿊⥺Э㕊⫖ⓙ㒰Э⠟⚖⪌る⢘㑀Џ┟⛔㍩ゾ㏞㐶д╌ⶣⷫМ㍋⠺╠ⷺ⮢㒢⯉⢅㏠Сⓟ⿞❑Ўⓑн⫝̸〳㋘㋇⮾☝⹍⟱з㑮㞕⟨㍝㛴⠯Ѓ╟◰エ㘅㓼О㔈⮵⹲⢣Т⯕㒯㑯⟜⹀⤪ߓП㐡ⷖows down, very gradually, to a crawl.[And everything turns silent.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiAntiJokes/comments/dmjgbr/how_many_doomed_souls_does_it_take_to_change_a/) <|endoftext|>

The rabbi claims his regular stool and the priest orders the same old order of two scotches on the rocks. Except they aren’t rocks, they are ice cubes.‘I think I want a divorce.’ exclaimed the rabbi.‘What? Why? What did I do wrong?’ the priest shrilledFoolish priest. You never got married what are you talking about.You see, these religious figures had been friends  for all their life, fulfilling the same, mundane day-to-day routines. Going to the same old bar with the same old drinks. It seemed it be enough for them. ‘I’m going to have to cut you off you have had too many drinks, sir.’ said the bartender to the priest.‘What? This is my first and only drink?’The priest gazed upon the sullen beauty of the waxy-faced bartender. Years of mental torment reflected in his eyes.That’s when a horse made its way inside, presumably sheltering from the rain. At least I think it’s raining. I like to think so. It could just be the sound of the air-conditioning. It is rather cold in here. It’s always felt cold since my wife left me for the Egyptian dentist that lives next door. Did you know that ancient Egyptians used crushed mice brains as toothpaste? Neither did i. Fascinating isn’t it. Please Sharon come back I miss you so much.That’s when the bartender looked at the horse and snarled ‘Why the long face?’ ‘I’m so sick of your shit, Gilbert.’ The horse turned and walked out, like Sharon. Please Sharon.The rabbi whipped out his fidget spinner to distract himself from the immense tension in the room. Leaving his wife meant he would only have the priest in his life. He is all he’ll have left.‘I am going to lay out a scenario for you. You have two doors, two paths to take. Two options. One consists of fulfilling the next phase in your life. A life without your wife. The other you keep your wife, but lose the priest. Whichever you choose, I’m sure the other will be in your heart forever.’ The rabbi stared at the priest. A life without him? He couldn’t. Never.‘I know what I have to do.’ shouted the priest as he arose from his seat. He flees the scene.‘My oh my is that the time already?’ Said the bartender. He ripped off his uniform revealing the sexy burlesque costume underneath.The rabbi gazed upon the stars (I knew it wasn’t raining I just lied earlier). Staring at the moon he knew that the priest would always be there for him. A lifelong friendship. Beautiful isn’t it. An unbroken bond to last a century.‘Dude, where’s my car?’ cried the rabbi. His vehicle indeed wasn’t there. That’s when the war began. <|endoftext|>

"It's him again. Save us oh God." utters the bartender.  "Which God are you calling to," asks the philosopher, "have you not heard that he is dead?"  "No..."  "OH YES! And, most extraordinarily, WE have killed him." Shouts the philosopher.  "What do you mean? Like, you and me, and the bartender over there?" another customer next to him asks.  "No, no. Us - the human race." replies the philosopher.  "Ah. But how could we..."  "Drink up the sea?"  "No, I-"  "Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon? What were we doing when we unchained this earth from its sun? Whither is it moving now? Whither are we moving? Away from all suns? Are we not plunging continually? Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there still any up or down? Are we not straying, as through an infinite nothing? Do we not feel the breath of empty space? Has it not become colder? Is not night continually closing in on us? Do we not need to light lanterns in the morning? Do we hear nothing as yet of the noise of the gravediggers who are burying God? Do we smell nothing as yet of the divine decomposition? Gods, too, decompose. God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him.”"Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?" the philosopher finishes. "Did you like it?" he asks the bartender.  The bartender, half-asleep, replies, "Yes, yes. Very interesting. Now, what was your name again?"  "Friedrich Nietzs-"  "Friedrich, look. My boss is going to come back in a few minutes and if he sees you still here without a drink on the table he's going to get mad at me. So I'm going to ask you one more time, either order something or get out of this bar!"  "Fine, I'll have a glass of milk."  "What?!"  "I'll have an ellipsis" says another customer."A what?""An "ellipsis", a narrative device used to condense time in a story.""Ah, okay."A couple of hours later:"Man, can you believe this guy? He was asking for milk, in a goddamn bar, Jeff" the bartender tells his friend.  "Who was he?" Jeff asks.  "Friedrich...something. Nitch might've been."the bartender replies  "Has the name of an oddball for sure."   "He was rambling something about God being dead and stuff."  "Was he one of them Jehova's witnesses?"  "No, I think he might've been one of my many hallucinations.""What are you on about?""I think my whole life is a dream Jeff. I don't know how to explain it""Well try, goddamnit."The bartender moves suddenly and strongly grabs Jeff's neck as he kisses him thoroughly and with extreme passion. "I am madly in love with you, Jeff. I have been ever since you stepped into this bar the very first time.""Wow, do you really mean it?""No! This is not me, you see. I am being controlled!""I really...thought you loved me.""Well, I do, platonically of course.""What's that?""Something to do with Plato, I think.""Who's he?""The guy who was here the day before. Kind of like Nitch."And that was the tale of the closeted homosexual Bartender as he listened to Nietzsche recite passages from “The Gay Science”(pun intended), and as he dealt with the problem of free will in a world constructed by the writings of a mentally deranged redditor. <|endoftext|>

First you must understand that fingers stem from the hand, they have nerve endings connecting all the way through the spinal chord to the brain... the brain of course has a mind capable of responding to patterns, feeling emotion and rationalizing and making decisions. But does it make decisions? What is consciousness? Let’s say we do have free will, are we not influenced by our surroundings? And suppose we do use our brain to communicate with that hand of ours. If we stared at it long enough could we gain insight in a way as if communicating with it?But does the hand have free will? Does the mind? Do any of us? What does it really mean?And as I sat there pondering the meaning of life I came to think that one could know the secrets of the universe through introspection with a simple question and various ponderings while staring at that hand. And in a single moment my life flashed before my eyes and I came to realize that the hand I was staring at was not my own, that I was in a catatonic state the last 5 hours and I was staring down the hand of a friend who was trying to get me to snap out of this state as the world seemed to stop and I say their frozen. Then it appeared the hand was coiled back as if to lunge sideways across the air. And I realized that perhaps we are all just air filled with individual molecules mostly made up of air with atoms mostly made of air and subatomic particles exhibiting quantum properties like the photon which is able to be in two places at once and constantly moving the same speed relative to the observer and thus perhaps it is in two places at once and two places in space time and if consciousness and time relative to that light changes, perhaps light contains multidimensional properties and is everywhere at once.And if light is an omnipotent, omnipresent nature to all things, perhaps we are all interconnected through the light. And Jesus said behold I am the truth and the light, so perhaps we are all one and religion as science can merge into an ever-present awareness of the self in its relationship to each other and the universe.Just then I saw that hand staring at my face, and I felt warm... for I felt as if I knew the secrets to the universe, consciousness, quantum field theory and life itself.... all from a single hand which had just approach my face.And in that moment I was connected to the everpresent existence to our quantumly entangled world and I felt the presence of the Logos. The word used for Jesus but also a concept meaning word and reason. And I had discovered my true nature as an eternal being within this universe. Behold for as my face is one with the universe... the hand... And then it hit me.I know! What the five fingers as one with the hand in a greater fractal pattern interconnected with fractals of cell’s which connect with fractal of molecules which are a branch of atoms which are a branch of layers of charged and uncharged energy below in patterns of subatomic and quantum level. I know what the five fingers said to the face! I knew it! And I not only knew it! I lived it! I was experiencing it now and it was beutiful. And then I felt the five fingers as a giant network of the universe interlaced through a quantum field interlacing with the blueprint of all matter... and as the five fingers communicated in this way I thought I heard something... it’s a sound that if we listen to the five fingers and hand talking to the face from the fractal pattern of our earth to the solar system down to the atom and up to the galexy from the minute to the gargantuan size of the universe itself and through the interconnected cosmic energy causing the ripple effect of the air vibrating the hairs on our outer ear drum and vibrating the inner ear being translated through the brain and from the brain which processes it all we can hear it as well. We can hear the five fingers saying to the face the inner workings of the universe. In conclusion, as I was pondering this wonderful magnificent feeling, I felt a pain of the five fingers for I was jarred from this infinite bliss and shocked back into reality. And the only thing I knew at that time was the hand and the face, but no longer in a metaphysical way but more of a “physical” way. And despite all of what I had said, at this moment the five fingers said to the face something and I heard and felt it in my face.the five fingers said to the face....SLAP! <|endoftext|>

The restaurantender opens the door and greets him with a smile. "Oh, I see where this is going. There are 10 countries in the world starting with KN. 7 Knights have already come here—3 more are left.""Actually," argues the lamentable Knight of Knigeria, "you forgot St. Kitts and Knevis, as well as Knee.""Knee?""Yes, Knee, the southwestern African territory, with its beautiful Kneel landscape and genial Kneel people. Knee is recognized by most governments of the world as an independent nation; don't worry, I know you're not gonna look it up. Problem is, there are infinitely many Kneel Knights of Knee, each with a different adjective and everything, and they're gonna burst through that door any second now and take all of your beer. I suggest you start pouring some glasses right now.""Oh, gosh!" the restaurantender says. "I'll get right on it! Thanks for warning me, Sir!""Please. It's sir."The restaurantender pours an infinite amount of beer into an infinitely voluminous glass (it's actually just a four-dimensional fractal). The lamentable Knight of Knigeria snatches the glass and gulps the infinite amount of beer right down his throat.

After receiving directions to the target's home, the motherfucker ventures out to fulfill his motherfucking contract. As he walks the "King's Road" he hears someone shouting: "Stop! Hold it right there, you fucker of mothers! Cease your movement of legs to gain forward momentum, by the order of the king!" The motherfucker sighs and turns around to face three knights on horseback."How are you able to discern that I am indeed a fucker of mothers?" Asks the motherfucker, now slightly irritated.The lead knight scoffs and replies: "Only experienced motherfuckers such as yourself thrust their pelvises for each step they take. That goulish, wide grin isn't doing you any favours either, motherfucker."The motherfucker, grinning even when frustrated, replies: "By the heavens, I guess discretion is not my strong suit, rather fucking mothers is.""Silence, you insufferable fornicator of mothers! I loathe you people, you better not fuck any of ours while out here. I can tell by the brisk in your walk and the vigor of your crotch movements that you're on a mission as we speak. Carry on then, motherfucker! You best stay away from mine!" The lead knight remarks before he spits onto the paved road. "You people are worse than rapists! I'll make you pay a toll the next time we cross paths on this road!" He says finally, before the knights carry on ridingThe motherfucker continues to travel, feeling a bit discouraged now. At some point, he crosses paths with a farmer that simply says: "Good evening, motherfucker." The motherfucker rolls his eyes and tries to adjust the way he moves and also trains on maintaining a blank facial expression during the remainder of his trip. After two hours, he finally reaches the manor that was described by the nobleman.He inhales and exhales once deeply and walks through a yard leading to the manor. He has already rehearsed his lines, planning on pretending to be a tradesman. The other targeted nobleman promptly rushes outside, seemingly enraged and yells: "You motherfucker, you! Stay where you are!"The motherfucker almost wails in frustration as he yells back: "Come on! What?! How can you possibly already be aware that I'm here to fuck your mother?!"The nobleman replies: "What?! No, don't come any closer unless you have a pair of glasses to put on, you fucking moron. You have stepped on numerous flowerbeds that are filled with my prized tulips!" <|endoftext|>

That is, if one is honey-nut and another is blueberry, they cannot mate. Anyway, there is this one normal cheerio that is in love with a blueberry cheerio. Unfortunately, he cannot mate with her. He can't even communicate with her because they are of different species. So, he invents a machine that changes all of his CNA (Cheerio DNA) into whichever type of cheerio that he wants. However, this machine performs a process that is extraordinarily painful, because that sort of thing would hurt. Anyway. He does it, and the normal flavored cheerio becomes a blueberry cheerio. Unfortunately, this girl cheerio hates him so much that she invents an identical machine and does the process on herself in order to become a cinnamon-apple cheerio, just so she can avoid this creeper. So, she does it. The boy cheerio is starting to get upset at this because he really wants her. So he tells himself that he will go through the pain for her, and becomes a cinnamon-apple cheerio. She then changes to a honey-nut cheerio! He decides that this is the last time that he will change cheerio type. He does it, and she changes one more time, into a normal cheerio - the kind he originally was. So he says out loud, "Okay, this is really the last time. If she changes again, I will just stay back with my family." So he becomes a normal cheerio again, and she doesn't change fast enough for him to put his moves on her. So, they start dating, and he finally asks her to the Formal Bowl (ahaha, get it, bowl instead of ball). Anyway, they get there and dance intensely for a few hours. Finally, they get tired and she sends the boy cheerio to the milk bowl (you know, since it's a cereal dance, they have that and punch). He gets there and stands in line for ten minutes. Finally fed up at the really long line, he looks over at the bowl of punch and realizes there is no punch line. <|endoftext|>

Do you fart in bed ?This is a story about a couple who had been happily married for years, the only friction in their marriage was the husband’s habit of farting loudly every morning when he awoke the noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air.Every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn't stop it and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor, she was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out. The years went by and he continued to rip them out. Then one Christmas day morning, as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the innards, neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts, and a malicious thought came to her. ''She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling the bed covers back, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts. Sometime later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bath room. The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good. About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of horror on his face. She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said, “Honey you were right… all these years you have warned me and I didn't listen to you.” “What do you mean?” asked his wife. “Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened, but by the grace of god, some Vaseline and two fingers. I think I got most of them back in…….............…..” <|endoftext|>

He orders a beer and looks up at a TV currently showing a news broadcast. The female news anchor ends a segment with stating: "Health authorities stress that you must maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from other people, sneeze into your armpit or a tissue and don't forget to wash your hands." After listing other preventive measures regarding the Corona pandemic.The contrarian sneers upon hearing her words and loudly proclaims within the audible range of the few other intoxicated people inside: "How about no, you mainstream media, corporate whore!?  I will do no such thing! HAH! In fact, watch me do the opposite of everything you just said!" The man runs his hands along the bar counter, starting from one side to the opposite end. He then touches as many surfaces as possible as he heads towards the restroom, stopping momentarily to caress a drunk man's head as well sticking his fingers inside the drunk man's mouth, who just stares at the contrarian with vacant and glassy eyes."What the fuck just happened?" The drunk man exclaims as the contrarian eagerly sprints into the restoom, urinates and rushes out without washing his hands while running his hands across his own face. The contrarian proceeds by faking a series of sneezes within 6 feet of some of the other drunk patrons of the bar as he dramatically circles the premises. "Atchoo! Atchoo! Prrr!" He yells in a contrived manner while ejecting droplets of saliva all over the establishment. He eventiually stops in front of a sign depicting the words"NO SMOKING""Fuck you, noone tells me what to do!" The contrarian yells before aligning numerous cigarettes along his mouth and lights them all at once. He dramatically inhales and exhales as much as much smoke he can before the bartender angrily approaches him."What the fuck is wrong with you? Get out of here, you clown!" The bartender demands. "Noone tells me what to d-.." is all what the contrarian manages to say in return before he's grabbed by the shoulders and forced outside by the bartender. The contrarian flips off the bartender, who just waves him off dismissively in return. "Whatever, your bar is s dive anyway!" The contrarian yells before leaving for the hotel he's currently staying in. He steps on a patch of grass which contains a sign which reads "Do not step on the grass" before finally arriving at his hotel.He enters the lift in order to get to his room after passing through the lobby. He notices a sign reading "Do not jump inside the elevator." He becomes enraged and immediately starts to violently jump up and down. "Yeah, take that! Fuck your demands, society!" Unfortunately for the contrarian, the elevator has become borderline derelict as no mainteance work has been done for quite some time. He plummets to his death as the elevator's cables finally give in and are ripped apart , the elevator having been situated at one of the upper floors before breaking.The contrarian now finds himself standing in front of the heavenly gates, where an illuminating and featureless being of light starts to address him: "Welcome, child. You may enter through these gates."The contrarian scoffs at the disembodied being and replies: "I don't need your permission or some sort of green light to do anything! You may stop giving me directions!" The being becomes speechless for a few seconds before retorting: "Are you absolutely retarded? You were only \*this\* close to making it here to begin with. I'll have you know that you just transmitted a disease to 6 people at a bar, aside from being an insufferable prick generally. You also pelted some ducks at a park with rocks a month ago, despite a sign telling you not to. You didn't know you were infected, thus you were not judged and punished accordingly. Consider yourself lucky and show some appreciation as you enter through these gates."The contrarian yells: "No! I will do the complete opposite of that and be fully unappreciative and consider myself privileged to do so..wait, in fact, I'm not even going to enter at all! HAH! So, get fucked!" The being says, seemingly taken aback: "You..wow, you really don't want to die on this hill, you stubborn child, you." The contrarian replies, with a grin on his face: "Oh, but I do! Watch me do it now, jackass!"The light being sighs before sending the contrarian to hell instead.The moral of this (antianti)joke is, nothing, there is no moral. I don't need to end this with some sort of meaningful message, screw you, in fact. Only self-righteous assholes preach about morals, there is the true moral for ya. <|endoftext|>

It'll all start on that day.Back then, one would dub this day the twentieth of April, sixty-nine thousand and sixty-nine, or 4/20/6969. To some this date would've seemed humorous, perhaps funny. And, well, it is a little. But it wasn't funny to one person in particular. That person was Adolf J. Hitler. 5000 years earlier, in his Führerbunker, he headed into his study with his wife at his side, his heart pounding restlessly. He knew it was the end. That's what he told everyone. Except… the end of what? He intentionally left that detail vague.The date was the 20th of April, 1969. That's the date when Hitler disappeared. Not one day earlier or later. I think.But of course, Hitler, as always, had one last Karte up his Ärmel, as they say. He had dabbled in the dark arts some time earlier in the year, and found a spell that he knew early on would come in handy, and this… this was the time to use it. 5000 years of slumber in the astral plane, before he will abruptly return to his old reality, reborn into a new state of existence. He would hold power greater than that any mortal being had ever witnessed before!The year will be AD 6969.AD, meaning "Anno Domini" (Latin for "in the year of the Lord"), is of course the opposite of BC, or "Before Christ." A common misconception is that, like BC, AD comes after the year number, but it should actually come *before* it. Just a bit of trivia.Anyway, the year'll be 6969 AD, 5000 years after Hitler's vanishing. It's hard to say precisely what state the Earth was in. It's all a blur to me. But not long after the spell had finally worked its way into Hitler's heart, we land in the beginning, and in the end. When all that will happen is happening, but all that happens comes later. It will be time itself.It was most unfortunate that Hitler did not manage to fall asleep in the astral plane. As the curse coursed through his veins, he coarsely cursed, yet he never dreamt. For 5000 years he had nought to do but wait for the time to come, and after a mere 200 years it was starting to piss him off.Figuring the only solution to this rage was to take revenge on time itself, the only barrier between his old life and his newer, he vowed to destroy time as soon as he'd acquired the power to do so. And that's exactly what he'll do. The year'll be A 6969 D. The date will be 4/20 (fuckin americans). The time will be 13:37. This will all happen. It is the only thing that "will" ever happen, because it'll all happen once and once only. For one Planck time, everything was together, living in harmony, singing the last song of time, before it'll all break apart.And then it'll happen.The next Planck time, everything will freeze. A new face will emerge, and it'll stare at every thing that exists, ever existed, and ever will exist, right in the eyes. That'll include you, at this very moment, as you read through the lines of this anti-anti-joke.The next Planck time, the face becomes real. It is that of the darkmage Xakh'ath'akh'arus, and as his mighty body rises from the mountain it once rested on, and his eyes blink open revealing two glowing white sockets, a shudder creeps through the core of the Earth itself. Without time to define velocity, and indeed velocity to define space, the universe is plunged into a state of nothingness, and for the first time in many millions of years, no one has the time to care. Literally. Xakh'ath'akh'arus soon realizes this problem, and so he creates a new temporal system, one so vaguely defined as to be skippable at will. No longer will eternity be a block that you cannot pass through—for now, you can wait an eternity using a supertask!Consider this: Do you want to wait one eternity in 2 minutes? Simple! Wait 1 second in 1 minute, then wait another second in 30 seconds, then another second in 15 seconds, and another one in 7.5, and another one in 3.75, and so on, always waiting for half the time left. Although there is always another second left to wait in eternity, you can always cut the remaining wait time in half, and so, when 2 minutes have passed, you will indeed have waited infinitely many seconds—one eternity in just 2 minutes. How about that?And what about old time, you say? Old time can stay behind us. The past shall stay where it is; the future shall simply be the one Planck time in which Xakh'ath'akh'arus was born; and the present shall be allocated for everything that exists after the future, in the new temporal system. Perfectly balanced, blah blah blah.It is now that our story begins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just kidding. Fast forward to###FIFTY-FOUR ETERNITIES LATERSociety is still trying, and failing, to cope with this newfound reality. Bars are a thing of the past—the only thing left are alcohol-free restaurants. You see, being intoxicated within this temporal system enables one to accidentally wait several eternities into the future, thereby missing out on an entire life without wanting to and thus possibly losing family and relatives. As such, it is agreed upon the remainder of surviving civilization to share one universal law: NO BARS. To avoid ambiguity, prison bars are also outlawed, as well as sick rap bars and chocolate bars. Prisons are to use bullet-proof glass instead, raps must not consist of more than one line, and chocolate is banned. This last decision was the most controversial of them all because it was put forward by a black guy.Suddenly, two people, a silver-haired man and a brunette-haired woman, materialize out of thin air on a roof in a graffiti-laden street, both leaning forward rather uncomfortably, their lips touching. Not long after, they both open their eyes, and quickly flinch away from each other."Who the hell are you?" asks the woman."W-what… who the hell are *you*?!" the man retaliates."I'm… I… I don't know, actually.""Wait. Me neither. Sorry for shouting at you.""It's okay. Don't stress about it."The man inspects their surroundings. Dull, grey buildings cover the landscape as far as the eye can see. Not a single skyscraper impedes the view. "Where are we?" he asks.The woman looks down below the roof. A good five yards above ground level, for sure. She is not as athletic as she used to be. Wait— "Wait. I think I'm remembering who I am," she says."You are?" asks the man."Yeah, yeah. It's coming back. But it's slow. I think I'm a… a vegetarian?""Oh. Cool." The man, still not recalling his identity, envies her speedy recollection. "Do you hear that?""The voice that said that you envy my speedy recollection?" Whoops."What? No, those Latin shouts. At least I think it's Latin." He's right. Those are Latin shouts. And they're getting louder. Realizing what is to come, he grabs the woman's hand. "Come with me!""What? Where—"The roof hatch suddenly bursts open, and a short surly-looking nun emerges with a shotgun in her arms."Come on, come on!" the man yells, running across the roof tiles as gunshots boom behind them."SPERO HOC SONAT FORMIDULOSUS, TRUX N-WORDS!"The woman screeches as he jumps off the roof and onto another, bolting with her hand and ducking behind a solar water heater."NUNC EGO NON REPREHENDO, SI RECTE DE FIDELI TRANSLATIONE CONSTET NAM SI PATI LASSUS SUM!" the nun shouts in what definitely sounds like Latin."Jesus Christ," the man yell-whispers, breathing heavily. "Are you okay?"The woman's eyes are wide open with fear, and yet, thrill. "Wow. That was fun.""It… was?" he breathes. "Huh. Yeah. It *was* fun." A smile climbs onto his lips. "Wanna do it again?"The woman returns a hearty grin. "Hell yeah."They jump again onto an adjacent roof, and for the few moments her feet hover above the ground, the woman feels her younger days coming back. What is her name? "What's yours?" she asks the man after their feet hit the concrete."Huh?""Your name.""Oh. Uh, I still haven't gotten there." They jump to another roof. "I'm just starting to remember my profession. I think I was… like a bartender or something? Or a waiter?" Another roof. "No, definitely a bartender. I worked behind a counter." Another jump. "What about you?""I was a mathematician, I think. And a highschool teacher. I taught English. Whoop!" She makes that sound after every leap. "I used to go to the gym on the weekends, but I stopped a couple years in. Teaching is exercise in and of itself. Whoop!"The man laughs. "Why are you making that noise?""It's fun! Whoop! Wait, wait, I think I'm remembering my name…"They stop in their tracks. The building they are standing on is only a few feet tall. The man climbs down to the ground and helps the woman on the way down."Thanks," she says."You're welcome. Are you remembering your name?""No, it just fleeted away. I think it was Chloe or something.""Then I'll call you Chloe for now."Chloe for now nods in approval, and scans the street. On the wall opposite them a graffito boasts the words "CONTUMELIIS AFFICIUNT" followed by a series of seemingly unrelated letters and apostrophes."Hey, uh, what is… Zack-ath-ac-arus? Zackathacarus? Ksacathacarus?""Hmm," muses the man. "That name sounds familiar.""Is it your name?""Yeesh, I hope not. I don't think it is though. Do I look like a Zack?""You're too old to be a Zack." She giggles."Yeah, that's… thanks." The old man's decrepit belly rumbles. "Man, I'm starved. Wanna go get something to eat?""Sure."The pair begin searching for a restaurant around the area. A restaurant is a lot like one's soul—if you give it money, it feeds you. Or, uh, if it gets no money, it'll either disappear or relocate, but you'll only know which once it's already happened. I don't know. A restaurant is similar to a soul in lots of ways. You could even say that what these two are doing right now is… **soul-searching**.The walls of this seemingly abandoned street are covered in graffiti, with the threatening capitalized message reappearing many times in different styles, colors and fonts. *CONTUMELIIS AFFICIUNT XAKH'ATH'AKH'ARUS*. Sometimes there is only one I in the first word; sometimes the apostrophes are missing from the third; but the same tone of urgency and hatred is shared among them all."Say," says Chloe (for now), "where do you think all the—where are you?" She looks around the place, but the man seems to have vanished without a trace. Perhaps he was never there at all, and was simply a figment of her lonely imagination. "Sigh," she says, leaning back on a wall of text. "One day…" She doesn't feel that hungry anymore. In fact she was never hungry—she just didn't want that strange man to leave her. But now he has, and she's left with nothing to do and nowhere to go. So what should she do?Well, as the great Empedocles once said, "When there is nothing left to do, wait." So she makes herself comfortable in the corner of the alley and sets to work. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi, four Mississippi, five Mississippi, six Mississippi, seven Mississippi, eight Mississippi, nine Mississippi, ten Mississippi, eleven Mississippi, twelve Mississippi, thirteen Mississippi, fourteen Mississippi, fifteen Mississippi, sixteen Mississippi, seventeen Mississippi, eighteen Mississippi, nineteen Mississippi, twenty Mississippi, twenty-one Mississippi, twenty-two Mississippi, twenty-three Mississippi, twenty-four Mississippi, twenty-five Mississippi, twenty-six Mississippi, twenty-seven Mississippi, twenty-eight Mississippi, twenty-nine Mississippi, thirty Mississippi, thirty-one Mississippi, thirty-two Mississippi, thirty-three Mississippi, thirty-four Mississippi, thirty-five Mississippi, thirty-six Mississippi, thirty-seven Mississippi, thirty-eight Mississippi, thirty-nine Mississippi, forty Mississippi, forty-one Mississippi, forty-two Mississippi, forty-three Mississippi, forty-four Mississippi, forty-five Mississippi, forty-six Mississippi, forty-seven Mississippi, forty-eight Mississippi, forty-nine Mississippi, fifty Mississippi, fifty-one Mississippi, fifty-two Mississippi, fifty-three Mississippi, fifty-four Mississippi, fifty-five Mississippi, fifty-six Mississippi, fifty-seven Mississippi—Suddenly, she is struck with a brilliant idea. Instead of counting one Mississippi at a regular interval, in this case once per second or so, she instead can count at an accelerating rate, such that the pause between each Mississippi is halved in time after every Mississippi. If she began with one Mississippi in one minute, she would then count the next one in half a minute, and the next in a quarter of a minute, the next in an eighth of a minute, then a sixteenth, a thirty-second, a sixty-fourth, a hundred-and-twenty-eighth, a two-hundred-and-fifty-sixth, a five-hundred-and-twelfth, a thousand-and-twenty-fourth, a two-thousand-and-forty-eighth, a four-thousand-and-ninety-sixth, an eight-thousand-one-hundred-and-ninety-second, a sixteen-thousand-three-hundred-and-eighty-fourth, and so on! Since the sum of all non-positive powers of 2 is, indeed, 2, to her it would seem as if no more than 2 minutes had passed, but to the outside world…?Excited by this notion, Chloe wastes no time and picks up an outrageously convenient stopwatch from the dirty cement. Surprisingly, and again, conveniently, it still works."Mississippi."She starts a timer and sits right back down, her face staring inches from the screen. As the seconds begin to pile up, a thought occurs to her—what if instead of saying the word "Mississippi" after every count, she instead would alternate between "Mississippi" and "Elephant"? If she does, the question arises—what would she say on the last count? Of course, since she would do this infinitely many times, there isn't really a "final" count—and yet, there is a very specifically defined point at which she literally stops counting, since at said point she would have counted infinitely many times. It makes no sense that her last count would be a Mississippi, since every Mississippi is followed by an Elephant, and neither does it make any sense that the last count would be an Elephant, because every Elephant is followed by a Mississippi.1 minute. "Elephant." It seems there is only one way to find out, she thinks, delightfully thrilled.Another thought occurs to her. After a good number of counts, would she still be able to keep up with the timer? Mississippi and Elephant are long words—both 3.5 syllables long. The average speaking speed is around 4 to 5 syllables a second, meaning in roughly five counts, she would have to significantly up her talking speed. The world record for the fastest talking speed, in your time, was 15 syllables per second, at least on average.30 seconds. "Mississippi."It is most fortunate, then, that she suddenly remembers it was her who broke the world record, a long, long time ago, when she accidentally uttered the word "a" in infinitesimal time during a lecture. A record-obsessed audio engineer had attended that lecture, recorded her voice, and after years of rigorous analysis, confirmed that she had indeed spoken at a speed of ∞ syllables per second.15 seconds. "Elephant."So it is indeed possible, she realizes, but she has only ever done this once in her lifetime. Now, she shall have to do it infinitely many times. Infinity times infinitesimal time equals two minutes.7.5 seconds. "Mississippi."Of course, back in old time, there was already a shortest possible unit of time—the Planck time, which is unfortunately only finitely short. Still, it's quite remarkable just how short it is. It's a bit difficult to visualize its incredible briefness, but here's an attempt:3.75 seconds. "Elephant."Let's say we count one second, and in each Planck time during that second we place a single grain of sand on the ground.1.875 seconds. "Mississippi."By the time we finish counting that one second, we'll have a whole lot of sand at our hands. How much, do you reckon? Enough to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool? Perhaps even the Grand Canyon? The entire state of New Mexico?0.9375 seconds. "Elephant."Actually, it turns out we would have enough sand to make a true-scale sand replica of our Sun… 1,600 times.0.46875 seconds. "Mississippi."We would still have some sand left over, enough to make 45 trillion replicas of all the planets in the solar system…0.234375 seconds. "Elephant."…and then, if you're feeling patriotic, 7 million sand-made copies of both the Earth and the Moon, and finally after that…0.1171875 seconds. "Mississippi."…well, you would still have a shit load of sand, more than you could possibly imagine. I just ran out of analogies.0.05859375 seconds. "Elephant."I think my point was that there's a lot of sand in the world and not enough people to mold it.0.029296875 seconds. "Mississippi."If we all molded sand every day of the week, imagine how great that would be.0.0146484375 seconds. "Elephant."We could make a new species, made entirely of sand, and have it succeed us humans when we succumb to Mother Earth's kiss of extinction.0.00732421875 seconds. "Mississippi."I'm sure the sand people would be fine.0.003662109375 seconds. "Elephant."Anyway, these Mississippi's and Elephant's are getting quite short, aren't they?0.0018310546875 seconds. "Mississippi."I think you get the point. Let's skip forward.###ONE ETERNITY LATER0 seconds. "Maleficent."Chloe opens her eyes slowly. She's in a different place now. The graffiti is gone. In fact, the whole weird grey Latin town is gone. She is now in a silent, barren desert, not a single indication of any kind of life as far as the eye can see. Just dunes. Horrible, unemotional, unresponsive dunes. Everywhere."Oh," she says quietly. "Oh, no. No, no, no, this can't be! Did I just…" She searches for something to kick at, but the ground is nothing more than sand. So she kicks the sand. "Fuck! I'm a fucking idiot. God fucking damnit." She sighs and sits down on the sand. The watch is still there—it reads 2:34. She stops the timer and flings it away from her."Ow!" She turns around. From below the dune, that strange man she saw in the grey town emerges, holding the stopwatch in his one hand and rubbing his face with the other. "We should keep this, you know. It might come in handy."Her eyes light up, and the next moment she bolts at him and wraps her arms around him. "Oh my god, I thought I'd lost you forever!"He smiles and returns a hug. "No. I'm starting to get this place. People don't disappear here—they just live in different times.""What do you mean?""How did you get here? Did you do the halving-time trick?""Yeah. How did you know?""I don't think there's any other way to skip eternities other than that.""No, I mean… how did you know it would work? The supertask? You didn't say you're a mathematician, or a philosopher.""Well, no, but being a bartender means you hear a few nerdy jokes here and there. I try to learn what I can. There's this one joke—come on, let's go.""What? Where? There's nothing but sand in this whole place.""Nah, I was in a western town just some time ago. I'm sure we'll find it in a sec."She scouts the area again. Not a single man-made or animal-made building anywhere, at least as far as she can see."C'mon!" The man begins walking, and Chloe comes to his side."How long have you been in this place?""Uh, a few weeks, I'd say? It's hard to keep time. These stopwatches aren't a dime a dozen." He drops the timepiece into his pocket and zips it up."And you waited… in this exact spot?""Nah, I went to get some drinks. Here." He hands her a bottle of water. It's warm. "The folks at that place were real nice. Hope we can find them again."Chloe takes a sip, but then she realizes she's not thirsty yet. "Why did you come back, then? Why didn't you stay there?""Well, I figured you'd pop up eventually. You seemed smart, and, uh, I guess I didn't really want to lose you."She pauses and looks at him. He returns a modest smile."Thanks," she says quietly."No problemo."The pair stroll for some time, and although Chloe doubts he really knows where he's going, she begins to feel quite comfortable at his side. "Do you remember your name now?" she eventually asks."Oh, yeah. I forgot to mention it. It's Bart Ender."She laughs. "Sure it is.""God, I wish. That'd be awesome. Nah, my actual name is Brian van der Ende.""Cute. Are you Dutch?""I guess so. I don't remember any of my childhood. All I remember from my past life is that I was a bartender. I guess that was more important to me than anything else. What about you?""Oh, I haven't had that much time to recollect, but… I think my name is Clie. But I don't remember much else.""Okay. Nice to meet you, Clie." He holds out his hand."Nice to meet you too," she says and shakes his hand, "Brian.""Please. Just Bart.""Bart."He smiles in approval and takes a scan around the area. "Okay, we are definitely lost. Darn."Clie sighs nihilistic-like, aye. "What are we gonna do?""Well," he says and sits on the ground, "as the famous Aristotle once said, 'When you're out of ideas, wait.'"She sits on the ground beside him. "Did he actually say that?""What? 'Course not, silly. It was in Greek." He pulls out the stopwatch. "How long do you wait for the first one?""Just a minute.""A minute? Why not, like, 10 seconds?""I guess that works too."He turns on the stopwatch and watches the watch wash away the first second, the second second, and so on.20 seconds later, they're gone.That was quick.#TO BE CONTINUED <|endoftext|>

Out of here, the lot of you. I---I fucking hate you all.James Blunt (leaning forward): Do you know what I have to say, after hearing such poetry?Madonna: Don't say it.Bartender: Don't say it.James Blunt: Fine, fine. I shan't say it, I shan't. Let's be on our way team, to the next pub down the road. What's it called?Bartender: The Dangling Diaphragm, that's the one.Then they all left and the bartender poured himself a drink and laughed. He chugged it down and slammed it on the wood and checked the clock. They weren't closing for 7 hours, in fact, they had only just opened.

"What was my line again? oh yeah; Hark! Are those cannons I hear?"  He hailed a cab; "Hark! Are those cannons I hear?"  All the way to the theater; "HARK! Are those cannons I hear? Hark; are those CANNONS I HEAR!?"     As he ran through the stage door, the director caught him; "Charlie! You're on in two minutes! Get your costume on! What's your line?
