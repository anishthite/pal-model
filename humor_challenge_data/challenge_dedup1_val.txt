A man walks in to a pet store and says to the clerk, "My girlfriend really loves animals.  Do you have one that would make a great Christmas present?"  The clerk say, "Sure, how about this bird? His name is Chet. Chet sings Christmas songs."The man looks at Chet and says, "That sounds perfect.  Show me."  The clerk takes a lighter and puts it under the bird's left wing.  The bird starts singing the greatest rendition of White Christmas that the man had ever heard.  The clerk then takes the lighter and places it under the bird's right wing, and the bird starts singing a perfect version of Jingle Bells.  At this point, the man is so impressed that he pays for the bird and hurries home.As soon as he gets home, he thinks to himself, "I better check to make sure that old man didn't scam me."  He puts the lighter to the bird's left wing, and just like in the store, the bird starts singing White Christmas.  He puts the lighter under the bird's right wing, and sure enough, the bird starts singing Jingle Bells.  So then he thinks, "What if I put the lighter between the bird's legs?"  He slowly places the lighter between the bird's leg, and the birds starts screaming, "CHET'S NUTS ROASTING ON A OPEN FIRE!" <|endoftext|>

Two students decide to go skiing for the weekend, and are having such a good time they decide to blow off the (calculus, I believe) exam that they have scheduled for Monday morning in order to get some final runs in before they head back to school. They decide to tell the prof that they got a flat tire and therefore deserve to take the exam at a rescheduled time.Hearing the story, said professor agrees that it really was just bad luck, and of course they can take the exam later. At the appointed time, the prof greets them and places them in two separate rooms to take the exam.The few questions on the first page are worth a minor 10% of the overall grade, and are quite easy. Each student grows progressively confident as they take the test, sure that they have gotten away with fooling the professor. However, when they turn to the second page they discover that they really haven't.The only question on the page, worth 90% of the exam, reads: "Which tire was flat?" <|endoftext|>

In the darkness. Seven has a hook for a hand as well, which is very scary <|endoftext|>
