Two Knotty Boys is cool, but their work tends to be more artistic and less functional.  I mean, we all love spending 45 minutes standing still while our partner works on an intricate Celtic knot that performs the same function as a 15 second square knot, right?Watch the Twisted Monk videos from his [website](http://twistedmonk.com/video.htm) and then catch more on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/twistedmonkstudios).As far as practicing, some you can practice on yourself.  Go to town tying your own legs down in frog ties, use the two column bind to bring your ankles together.  Some, like harnesses and hogties, you may just have to work with your partner, but that can be part of the fun of it.  Make it known you're planning on just practicing and have a blast without all the expectation of constant control and perfection.&gt; She has had other existenced partners before so I'm a little intimidated that I won't be good enough so I would love to wow her!You'll never match up to the ghosts you think you're competing against.

To assemble their combo, they need to draw 1/30, 1/15, 1/15 [ Emperor, Warsong, Berserker ].So your odds of stopping the combo and killing them are about as good as theirs are for assembling the combo to kill you in the first place. Yeah, its not going to be 100% but generally v.

Same thing applies to Evolve. All maps are free and you can play together or against Hunters and Monsters you don't own.

If you don't like the DLC, you simply don't buy it or just wait until it's cheaper.	0.0

Here is an excerpt from my [Introduction to Folklore: Traditional Studies in Europe and Elsewhere](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Folklore-Traditional-Studies-Elsewhere-ebook/dp/B00N65B0BY/ref=la_B001JS9G8Y_1_16?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1440093082&amp;sr=1-16&amp;refinements=p_82%3AB001JS9G8Y) (Kindle, 2014), which addresses some of what you're after; and then I'll post an excerpt from an article I wrote on this subject:Ceremonies associated with death were perhaps most endowed with ritual and magical practices. Death was an opportunity to ensure the eternal well-being of a friend or relative. It could also provide the living with a powerful supernatural ally. Burial practices in Western Europe generally reflect positive attitudes toward the dead. The farther to the east in Europe one looks, one finds cultures increasingly concerned with the possibility of the dead walking after death. People regarded the deceased as malevolent and dangerous. These generalizations can be easily challenged by contrary examples from various regions; the diversity of humanity is key even though there are regional trends.There is archaeological evidence of feelings toward the dead. In Western Europe, Neolithic societies buried the deceased in collective mounds where the bones accumulated. People made seasonal gifts at the entrances to these chambers apparently to procure continued good will from the otherworld and to ensure that departed loved ones would have a comfortable existence. In the east, prehistoric burials were typically solitary. It is not uncommon to find remains that were tightly bound in a fetal position. Individuals who seem to have inspired particular concern had rocks shoved into their mouths and large stones placed above their burials. These were apparently intended to keep the dead from talking and from walking from the grave. This sort of archaeological evidence can also be found in burials from historic periods. Again, any effort to see these contrasting traditions as rigidly defined by geography is called to question by exceptions.The Eastern European tradition of the walking dead has diffused into North America thanks to the literary and cinematic use of the Nosferatu, the vampire. That said, the idea of walking corpses cannot be regarded as entirely an eastern phenomenon: the animated dead also played an important role in medieval Icelandic sagas. Here, the aptrganga maður – the “after walking man” – was especially troublesome and required the bravery and strength of a great hero to end its reign of terror. Chopping off the head of the corpse and placing it between the body’s legs was one of the only ways to put these monsters to rest.Throughout European peasant society, there was also a great deal of concern about determining when a person had “passed over.” In modern times, it may seem obvious that death occurs when the heart stops. Even today, however, the line between life and death can be vague, occasionally requiring a judicially-determined definition. And even this can become the subject of political squabbling. In the modern world, death can be defined as brain-dead, but then there can be a question about whether or not it is appropriate, ethical, or legal to “pull the plug” to stop the heart from beating when the brain ceases to function. In traditional European society, the line between life and death was far more ambiguous. A person still living by today’s standards could cross over into the domain of death because of a disease, immense old age, or because of a curse. A large catch of fish or some other extraordinary circumstance might also signal the transition even when dealing with a healthy, young person.In the Icelandic sagas, these people were feigr, or “fated to die.” This is echoed in the archaic English word “fey” as in “he had a fey look about him.” In other words, the person was destined to die, and somehow the shadow of death had already descended over him even though his heart continued to beat. A person who had made this transition withdrew from normal society and activities, preparing to die. Society regarded the person as essentially dead.In the same way, the dead could do almost as much as the living. Medieval stories tell of the dead walking, talking, eating, and having sex. Obviously, such occurrences were to be feared and there were many rituals and forms of magic intended to keep the dead in the peaceful quiet of eternal sleep. In contrast, there was also a wide variety of magical practices available for the brave few who would call upon the dead to do their bidding.	0.0
IIRC he was still working on that song at the time of his death, and it was his mother and sister that added that to the song after he died.  Although I could be wrong, since people were screaming it at his shows when he played it.EDIT:  can't find the source for the first part but it turns out it was his sister and girlfriend who were yelling it during the song when he played it live.

It's the basic idea behind [Just-so stories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-so_story). The term is usually applied to dodgy science, but it also is applicable to this - believers started with the premise that god will not help them, and worked backward to invent justifications.Another one I enjoy is: In Matthew and Mark Jesus says "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?". This seems to support the arguement Jesus was just a man, and when push came to shove the God-given powers he thought he had were fictitious. The knowing self-sacrifice arguement, in this line of thinking, is a post-hoc justification by his followers, to explain how the chosen of God could be killed by so mortal a foe as the Romans.	0.0

You can only send so many kids to the office, and usually you want to save that for more severe write ups. Basically teachers are screwed when they have kids who don't give a shit.

For one thing, that definition doesn't actually say racism requires intent. "The belief that..." doesn't mean it has to be a conscious belief. For another thing, it pretty clearly said "especially", not "exclusively", so I don't know why you're singling out that part of it. Even then, everything that makes fun of or belittles an entire minority race is rooted in racism.

I have one, though unfortunately I haven't had a chance to do a whole lot with it. Though now that I have an electrical engineering degree and work as a firmware developer, I really should try to jump back into it.I hope you aren't scared of Assembly - it does technically support C, but it's extremely limited (unless you buy an expensive compiler meant for using Freescale chips for commercial applications). If I recall correctly, you can't use the external memory from C without that compiler - so you could do effects that don't need much memory, but anything delay-based would be out of the question. I suppose it may be possible to use C with inline Assembly for the things the C compiler doesn't support, but I don't know if anyone has been able to do that yet. On all the forums I've read, the opinion seems to be "just use Assembly".And yes, it's possible to do more advanced DSP effects - [here's an arpeggiated pitch shifter someone made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6idBRbO7RU). I'm not sure if it uses FFTs or a time-domain algorithm like PSOLA, but either way, it's probably going to be a lot of work in Assembly.Also, it uses fixed-point math. It's not difficult once you get used to it, but some things will have to work quite a bit differently than with floating-point.Some useful links:* [The hardware &amp; software manuals for the thing](http://line6.com/support/manuals/tcddk) - these might be a good read if you want to know what you're getting yourself into before you get one* [The old TCDDK forum](http://line6.com/supportarchive/forum/69) (which is now read-only)* http://audioartillery.com/projects/tonecore_dsp_dev_kit_guideAlso, I know less about it, but the [Hoxton Owl](http://hoxtonowl.com/) ([Kickstarter link](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/marser/owl-programmable-effects-pedal)) seems like it would probably be friendlier to use.

I'm in a similar situation. I was between jobs for the last couple weeks and haven't had money for drugs. I just started a new job but haven't been paid yet and basically, I'm hating life. Being sober is so goddamn boring it makes me want to scream and knowing that it could still be a week or two until I can do drugs again is destroying my psyche. Unlike you I've never really noticed much memory impairment from doing drugs and being off of them doesn't seem to improve it all that much. I don't have any solid advice for you but I'll tell you what I'm going to do. As soon as I get paid I'm getting right back on the horse. To me, life is not worth living if I can't alter my consciousness. Is that a good thing? Maybe not but I can't go on unless I have a way if silencing the noise in my head. All I do when I'm sober is sit around reading books because they're the only thing that comes close to occupying my mind. Sorry, just had to rant. I'm so frustrated right now. Without drugs I simply find no joy in life.	0.0

It's not about whether or not they deserved it, obviously they didn't. Not everyone feels worse for animals than they do for humans, but it's fairly common. This picture is an extreme example. Here's a better one: Which felt worse in I Am Legend, (spoilers)when Will Smith died (edit: or his family), or when he strangled his dog?

They legally have to compete like any other business. And they can lose their license. They have NO control over whether or not that happens. Any Ohioan that wants to grow commercially can apply for a license in four years. Which will happen. The retail stores and production facilities will always lobby for more growing competition. Why do you think they all picked land away from each other? Any retail store can buy from any of them. They're only going to increase in number every year as the commission is required to review licenses and demand every year. There's tons of opportunity for people wanting their share of the pie. The bill allows more retail stores than will realistically open in my wildest dreams and sets no limits on the independent production facilities. It's easily as good as Colorado for the consumer.	0.0

My MIL was the exact same way. She came to visit the week after we came back from the hospital and insisted on staying with us for a week in our ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT. Like your PIL's she didn't want to cook or clean only insisted that me and my SO go on dates and that DD sleep in the living room with her. WTF? No. My daughter was a week old, I wasn't about to leave her with someone whose parenting skills I highly distrust. This type of thing kept happening until finally I told my husband that if he doesn't handle the situation I would and I would not be nice about it. He finally took her out to lunch and had a long conversation with her and since then she's gotten much better about the way she acts. She is still condescending but I just shrug that off. Not much you can do in terms of that but when it comes to the way your PIL's treat your child you can definitely have a say in that. I just found that it was more effective for me to get my across via my husband because he was sort of a buffer between us. But, if you're husband isn't okay with that then I think you'll have to take matters into your own hands and have a mature and well communicated discussion with them.	0.0

Front offices are not nearly as good at personnel decisions as we like to think.  Perfect example:  Browns taking Manziel in the first round, Giants releasing Will Hill to waivers, Redskins trading three years of 1st and one 2nd round draft pick for RG3, every single move made by the Jets in 2014, etc.  Another great example is [the data comparing when coaches should go for it on 4th vs. what they actually do.](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/upshot/4th-down-when-to-go-for-it-and-why.html?_r=0&amp;abt=0002&amp;abg=1)  Coaches and managers rarely go against the general consensus of how the game "should" be played or who "should" be playing it.    I don't know if that's a good reason or not, but there are a lot of teams out there that probably had a reciever corps that would have been improved by picking up guys like TO, Moss, Johnson, etc.	0.0

It sucks that you didn't have a good weekend, but I don't see how that was anybody else's fault. Yes, there are quite a few fans who aren't that pleasant to be around for 2+ hours, but speaking for myself, whenever I saw somebody from RT on the floor or walking around, of course I would try and get a picture/autograph with them. Why do you expect thousands of people who want to meet them step back specifically for you?You make it sound like you're above everybody else ("a decent human being") who asked for something like that when you're complaining that they didn't go out of their way to meet you out of the 40k fans that were there. They made themselves as accessible as they could over the course of the entire weekend. If you hadn't left in a huff after the AH panel, you would have known that a ton of RT people (including Ryan, if we're talking strictly AH) did impromptu signings near the end of the day. If you had been literally anywhere in the convention center, chances are, you would have been able to meet an RT member.

Also the first time we used supers in combat.  One of the main reasons we were willing to throw our wyverns into that fight was because nulli was there.

Eh...  Lots of possible reasons.The class is mostly women, yes?  "The bros" have a natural commonality, being a minority in the group.  Maybe your bf is more of a guys guy.  Maybe he just got lucky that the few dudes in his class were friendly.  Maybe the women are married to jealous husbands.  Maybe they (like me) don't use Facebook often and keep their profiles pretty tightly locked down.  Maybe they don't feel comfortable adding a random dude.  Maybe they keep their professional and personal lives separate.  Maybe there's some confirmation bias going on at your end.  Maybe this has nothing to do with gender at all.Could be a million reasons.  None of which matter particularly.  No one is owed any of anyone else's time.  You're being presumptuous and overbearing, and it's putting people off.	0.0

I'm 35, not married, although in a long term committed relationship, with no plans to marry or have children ever. My SO and I also do not live together and have no current plans to cohabitate. We each have our own lives, with demanding careers we love and work-aholic lifestyles. We both value independence and personal space. It's certainly atypical, but it works for us.The good: Living apart, the time we spend together is always planned with intention, so it never feels like an obligation or requirement. We schedule when to get together and we focus on enjoying that time. We never take each others presence for granted and nothing ever falls into boring routine. We're always excited to see each other.The annoying: It's very unconventional, so you have to get used to people asking when you're getting married, moving in, or dealing with folks rudely telling you you'll change your mind about having babies. And you'll most certainly disappoint some of your family. My mother is especially aggrieved that I'm not Mrs. So-in-So and churning out grandbabies for her. A pain to deal with, but whatever.Would I do it all again? Absolutely. This is what's right for me. This is what works for me. This makes me happy. To hell with anyone who insists I conform to a cookie cutter lifestyle.	0.0

Kidney stones are treatable, and their risk can be reduced by getting enough Citric Acid in the form of food, Potassium Citrate, or Magnesium Citrate. Electrolyte supplementation is heavily encouraged on the ketogenic diet anyway.We are talking about a 5% incidence of kidneys stones among epileptic children on the strictest ketogenic diet, which is reduced to 0.7% with preventative Potassium Citrate supplementation.People with kidney disease still should stay far away from keto, among a lot of things.	0.0

This fascinates me -- I really would like to know the story behind this property being abandoned. After looking closely I'd say that this house was abandoned for no more than 22 years. I'd venture to say that it belonged to an elderly person who kept their children's rooms intact after they left home. Perhaps the tenant went to live at a nursing home &amp; then passed on. I could see the family leaving the home this way, especially if they didn't have a financial need to sell it -- can you imagine having to liquidate, pack up and move all of this stuff?

&gt; As an example, fairly recently I had a ridiculously hard time getting my (Legitimate) copy of Crysis to work. Turns out Crysis 1 and Windows 8/8.1 don't play very well together and you CAN get it to work, but it involves a bunch of patches that you need to manually seek out (Origin won't download them for you, not sure about Steam but I'd guess no)Try playing Crysis 1 on console then ;)&gt; PC gaming is a pain in the ass sometimes, pretending otherwise is just silly. Last gen consoles had pretty high failure rates but that seems a bit better this gen. I think a lower fps/resolution tradeoff is acceptable when everybody has to develop to the same specs.Anything lower than 60fps/1080 on something as expensive as consoles (it's not only 300 bucks for device, you have to pay A LOT more for games which makes PC less expensive and superior in any other way adventure).Spend 500 bucks for a PC (along with gamepads), hook it up to TV, set Steam Big Picture mode to start at boot - enjoy superior gaming experience. You will get back additional cash you shovel in front from 80% game sales.EDIT:Btw, [yet another benefit of PC gaming - flexibility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP0kXGRJGFQ) ;)	0.0

If you're willing to do some "outside the box" thinking, I'll share what I did, because I really wanted a standing desk too lol. I bought something that is essentially a standing desk in all but name. There are a lot of local neighborhood shops that will have like shelving and metal racks outside. You know the kind: basically just metal wire-frame shelving stands. Well, I went in and one of the items he had was like a tall shelf on wheels, meant to display plants or something. Well all I did was ask him to make it about "this" high. So for $80 I got a nice elevated shelf that is actually height-adjustable (you know, click the thing into place) on wheels. The "shelf" part is about 2 feet by 5 feet, which to me is perfect for a desk (I mostly use it to stand at my computer, as I'm doing right this very minute), and I've got it to a height between my chest and belly. The wheels lock, it's always been sturdy, and overall I'm totally satisfied with it. The guy even delivered it. I too tried the "desk on a desk" at first, and it was miserable. This thing? Never looked back. The wood "shelf/desk" is nice, pretty, and smooth, and the metal legs are white with gold trim. Give it a shot!	0.0

I come from an upper-middle class southern WASP family.  I attended a southern Tier-I university.  Now, my dad tried to teach me to change a tire growing up but I was a computer nerd and never wanted to get 'hands on' with anything.Fast forward to college.  I'm driving with a friend of mine from Boston from a similar but yankee background.  We're driving when I suddenly get a flat, so I pull over.  What ensues is a 2 1/2 hour 'trial and error' session of changing the tire.  We eventually figured it out, but I asked my friend what the hell I should do with the flat tire (which was still attached to the rims, mind you) -- he said, "Oh just throw it in the ditch since it's flat and you can't use it anymore."  So I threw that bad boy into the ditch.  Called my dad the next day all proud that I had changed a tire on my own and he said, "Well that's great son!  What did you do with the rim?"  :facepalm:	0.0

I was at the dentist in the waiting room. There was a asian old lady. She was not speaking romanian(my country's language) nor english.

They do that all the time. I agree they didn't punish the first ones nearly harsh enough but it hadn't become an epidemic like it has now. Maybe if they had punished nutchecks after the 4th or 5th one we wouldn't still be seeing them but because they are staying consistant by not punishing then it is somehow better? No. They should start punishing those severely now too. Just because they fucked up in the past doesn't mean they should continue to fuck up for consistency's sake.	0.0

I spent over a year working in a police department. In that time, I went on multiple ride-alongs and got to spend a lot of time learning about police training. One big point that they always drove home was the concept of "necessary action". The basic idea is that, depending on the threat level, officers should respond with appropriate force. If someone approaches you with their bare fists, you respond with mace, a taser, or hand to hand combat. If someone approached you with a knife, you would taser them given the opportunity, or shoot them if the situation is dire. In this situation, I see a man getting out of the car with his hands in the air. At best, I could see a reasonable officer using a taser. But a gun? That's too much. Police aren't military, they protect and serve. If that means lowering the threat level with non-lethal means, then that's their job.	0.0

&gt; The question people need to get more interested in is, why is the Morrigan calling so many people who aren't warriors?I'd wager the vast majority of Her worshipers are civilians; I only met one other pagan in my time in the USAF (an Asatru) and none since going private. I heard of a few more Asatru in the USA and USMC, but that's about it. It might be different in the European armed forces, but I couldn't remark on that.I shouldn't speculate on what my matron's plans are, as I have no need to be privy to such knowledge, but I do think many of the people who choose to follow Her do so only because She's "badass" or a "feminist superhero" (that second one requires it's own thread). She's been really popular lately, and while I don't mind that in and of itself, I do mind it when it starts coloring the popular perception of Her and pushing said image in a direction that renders people like me "extreme" or worse "false". People are choosing to omit The Morrigan malevolent side in favor of a more "mother goddess"-esque image, and it feels like She's just going to be lost to the world again.	0.0

&gt; Sex is the quickest way to establish a meaningful relationship between characters, Monhier explained, **and to justify Geralt's pursuit of Yennefer.** "We couldn't just tell you to go find someone you don't know or care about," he said. "It wouldn't work."This is what bugs me. Ignoring the woeful lack of originality in going with the Damsel in Distress plot, they think the only way to justify the player caring about her enough to want to go rescue her is by showing what she means to Geralt. That's so fucking boring. How about making us want to rescue her for her own sake - because she's interesting, likeable, funny, or sweet? Someone we actually care about, whether or not Geralt has stuck his dick in her. Dude has stuck his dick in nearly every woman he has come across in these games. That doesn't make someone particularly special in this regard. If her only development is that she spreads her legs for the main character... urgh.This is where Bioware absolutely trounces CDPR I'm afraid. The development of the companion characters is amazing. If Dorian went missing, I would tear apart Thedas looking for him - even if I wasn't and couldn't ever be in a relationship with him. I do not need to have sex with any one of those characters to give a crap about them, because Bioware did a fantastic job of defining their characters and making them compelling. There is more compelling romance in Cullen getting tongue-tied over being smiled at than there ever was in a single Witcher sex scene. The scene where you find Cassandra reading a romance novel is profoundly more endearing than just seeing her naked.This is something CDPR has yet to understand. Sex in video games is awesome and I love it.

&gt; Do you mean you and your wife were hostile to each other, and not working together?Yes, exactly this.I think some is inevitable other than for maybe the few who already get along perfectly.  We had it in spades, and by age 3 we were actively pushing each other away.  We had a ton of resentment, weren't really on the same page as far as parenting, and pretty much just stopped trusting each other's judgement.All of those things were present in our relationship before kids, they were all just too small to really worry about.  Like /u/sakkaly's mother said, kids don't make things better or worse, they just make them more.  When those things got bigger, they started to magnify each other.We never really *fought* (I'd guess I've shouted at my wife maybe six times in fifteen years, and she's shouted at me twice).  It started slowly, and to be fair life was *hard*, but three years later we found ourselves completely miserable and so far apart that it was difficult to even find common ground.The stupid part is that righting things really wasn't hard.  It was a lot of work and effort, but when I think about the *hard* things I've done in life, it doesn't even rank.  If we'd known better, we could have done it earlier and saved ourselves a great deal of greif.  Life is good now, and where we've been is directly related to where we are so I wouldn't change things, but in retrospect most of it was probably completely unnecessary.We still sometimes don't feel like a team or even work against each other.  The difference is that we're proactive about it.  We look out for it, and when we find it we communicate about it directly instead of letting it fester and lead to more negative feelings.  Then we approach it as partners seeking a common solution, rather than as adversaries seeking to win.The facilitator at a marriage workshop gave me a great image that I will remember for the rest of my life: he held up a water bottle and said "this is the problem."  Then he set it down and threw paper at it with his "spouse" trying to knock it over.  When they sat side-by-side, they had an easier time and never hit each other with any of their throws.  It's so simple and stupidly obvious, and also perfectly illustrated something my wife and I needed to learn.	0.0

Funny you should say that, I had the stupidest thing happen to me ever on one of my recent games.I had a soldier in a danger room who didnt have any armor, I just had him in there training dodging and his weapon skills. Well I ordered my smith to make him some iron armor since we finally had enough, and then edit his uniform. He drops all his clothes right in the danger room, and leaves to go get his armor, right?Well then a ton of civillians swarm into the danger room all trying to claim socks. I was freaking out because among them were some of my legendary smiths. They all manage to make it out unscathed, and right as I let out a sigh of relief, UristMcSoldier comes back in his shiny new set of full iron armor and steps into the danger room.Immediately a wooden training spear strikes him straight in the throat, and it "explodes in gore" I watch helplessly and in shock as he shuffles backwards out of the danger room, with blood gushing out of his neck and hosing crimson all over the walls and floor. He stumbles about 5 tiles, leaving a thick trail of blood before he trips over and quits convulsing.I just  kind of sat back in my chair for a few minutes in horror. It may be a text based game, but damn If that wasnt one of the most unexpected and brutal ways to go.	0.0
&gt;Which is pointless, because many of them cannot pass the same physical requirements as men.There are plenty of men who can't, either. Does that mean the fact that military conscription is historically centered around drafting men no longer counts?Of course it doesn't, because that would be retarded. If you meet the requirements, you meet the requirements. If you don't, you don't. It's that simple. Sex doesn't need to come into play to begin with, the standards are what matter and therefore the standards should be the determining factor, whether the job be military, firefighting, bricklaying, or underwater basket weaving.	0.0

&gt;michael huckabee who says the Military should get involved in stopping women from having abortions.Which sounds like something a big, powerful government might do, no? You are making the mistake of thinking that liberal vs. conservative is all about social issues, when in reality it's about the size of government, and it's purpose in our lives. Conservatism is the belief that a small government will allow for the greatest personal freedoms and individual liberties. Wanting a big, strong government to force social and religious beliefs down peoples' throats is not an example of conservatism, it is an example of fascism.&gt;Ted Cruz who is AGAINST Net Neutrality and is being called an idiot by Republican Engineers for doing so."Government regulations are bad" is a pretty conservative talking point, and net neutrality isn't an exception. The problem isn't net neutrality, the problem is lack of competition in ISPs allowing these ISPs to prey on the consumer. Competition is essential for capitalism to function, but thanks to big brother legislating their competition out of business for them, cable monopolies dominate the country. Personally I agree that with the monopolies in place, net neutrality is a very good idea. But it shouldn't be necessary if the market was functioning freely in the first place.The fact that all of these republican candidates are talking about expanding the size and powers of the government so they can push their fringe-crazy social beliefs shows that yes, the political spectrum IS moving to the left... but the SOCIO-political spectrum is moving to the right. The current crop of republicans wants to build a big, powerful government so that it can push it's radically-right social/religious agenda. That's not a very conservative thing to want.'EDIT: changed some wording	0.0

If you were to conduct even a modicum of research, you'd discover that nothing that i've stated, is false. Yes, there's a shadow government that came to the forefront and demonstrated what it's capable of on 9/11. Here's a litte foreshadowing for you to consider:9/11 and precisely how to respond to it, and what would happen as a result ie: the 'ferocity' of the reaction/response in the process of undermining Civil Liberty, was the national POLICY, three years prior to 9/11, later affirmed by the future policy leaders, one year PRIOR to 9/11. Philip Zelikow, who was later appointed by the Bush Cheney Whitehouse to Chair the 9/11 Commission, in collaboration with people like Robert Gates and Ashton Carter was the one responsible. He has a Phd in the use, and misuse, of historical public myth for the purpose of perpetuating the various policy positions that would arise and sustain their influencial power even after the experiencing generation passes away, or has such a dim memory of it that it becomes a public presumption or simply put a public myth. ---His "think tank" or study group (sounds so innocuous) published a paper that goes by two names, "Catastrophic Terrorism: Tackling the New Danger, Imagining the Transformative Event" http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/54602/ashton-b-carter-john-deutch-and-philip-zelikow/catastrophic-terrorism-tackling-the-new-dangeror simply "Catastrophic Terrorism: Elements of a National Policy". http://belfercenter.hks.harvard.edu/publication/2978/catastrophic_terrorism.htmlFull text here (with complementary mushroom cloud).http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/652/catastrophic_terrorism.htmlSome brief highlightsThe bombings in East Africa killed hundreds. A successful attack with weapons of mass destruction could certainly take thousands, or tens of thousands, of lives. If the device that exploded in 1993 under the World Trade Center has been successful (building's toppled), the resulting horror and chaos would have exceeded our ability to describe it. Such an act of catastrophic terrorism would be a watershed event in American history. It could involve loss of life and property unprecedented in peacetime and undermine America's fundamental sense of security, as did the Soviet atomic bomb test in 1949. Like Pearl Harbor, this event would divide our past and future into a before, and after.***The United States might respond with draconian measures, scaling back civil liberties, allowing wider surveillance of citizens, detention of suspects, and use of deadly force.*** More violence could follow, either further terrorist attacks or U.S. counterattacks. Belatedly, Americans would judge their leaders negligent for not addressing terrorism more urgently.For more..http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/652/catastrophic_terrorism.htmlList of signatories and related documentation and letters.http://www.publiceye.org/pnac_chart/pnac.html--Additional Notes:While at Harvard he (Zelikow) worked with Ernest May and Richard Neustadt on the use, and misuse, of history in policymaking. They observed, as Zelikow noted in his own words, that "contemporary" history is "defined functionally by those critical people and events that go into forming the public's presumptions about its immediate past. The idea of 'public presumption'," he explained, "is akin to William McNeill's notion of 'public myth' but without the negative implication sometimes invoked by the word 'myth.' Such presumptions are beliefs (1) thought to be true (although not necessarily known to be true with certainty), and (2) shared in common within the relevant political community." Zelikow's focus was on what he calls 'searing' or 'moulding' events [that] take on 'transcendental' importance and, therefore, retain their power even as the experience generation passes from the scene." (doubtful)In Rise of the Vulcans (Viking, 2004), James Mann reports that when Richard Haass, a senior aide to Secretary of State Colin Powell and the director of policy planning at the State Department, drafted for the administration an overview of America’s national security strategy following the September 11, 2001 attacks, Dr. Rice, the national security advisor, "ordered that the document be completely rewritten. She thought the Bush administration needed something bolder, something that would represent a more dramatic break with the ideas of the past. Rice turned the writing over to her old colleague, University of Virginia Professor, Philip Zelikow." This document, issued on September 17, 2002, is generally recognized as a significant document in the War on Terrorism. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_D._Zelikow---Re: The Family Steering CommitteeThe Family Steering Committee for the 9-11 Commission repeatedly called for Philip Zelikow’s resignation. The families, citing Zelikow’s close connections to the Bush Administration, were concerned that Zelikow’s appointment made a mockery of the idea that the Commission was “independent” but  Bush/Cheney Administration simply ignored their complaint and proceeded by acting "as if" there were no conflict of interest, as with Henry Kissenger the 1st Bush appointed Chairman who had to step aside when it was discovered that he had business dealings with the bin Laden family. (ouch) Chronology Of Zelikow’s Ties To The Bush Administration:1989-91: Zelikow works closely with Condoleezza Rice as part of the National Security Council during George Bush Sr’s Administration.1995: Zelikow &amp; Rice write a book together.1996-98: Zelikow &amp; Rice are together again when Zelikow is Director of the Aspen Strategy Group, a Zionist foreign-policy strategy “think tank.” Rice, along with Dick Cheney &amp; Paul Wolfowitz, are also members.2000: Zelikow &amp; Rice are reunited when Bush names Zelikow to his transition team for the National Security Council.2000: Zelikow is briefed by former White House terrorism czar Richard Clarke about the growing al-Qaida threat.2001: Zelikow is appointed by Bush to the President’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.2003: Zelikow is appointed Executive Director of the 9/11 Commission. Thus it is no different than if Rice or Cheney had been running the Commission.2004: Zelikow skews the investigation by deciding which topics would be investigated and which ones not. Bush’s comic book line for the motive behind 9/11 is taken by Zelikow: “Al Qaida hates our freedom.”2004: Zelikow is secretly in contact with President Bush’s close adviser Karl Rove while the “independent” Commission is completing its report finalized on July 22 2004.and the list goes on.. ---Video - Zelikowhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuoQZkBFj9A---	0.0

He likely did meet the mens rea requirement for assault as it is an easy standard to meet. In Illinois, someone commits an assault when they knowingly engage in conduct which places another in reasonable apprehension of suffering a battery (an unlawful application of force). [720 ILCS 5/12-1](http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs4.asp?ActID=1876&amp;ChapterID=53&amp;SeqStart=20887500&amp;SeqEnd=22225000). The mens rea element of that statute is the word "knowingly." It doesn't matter if he was upset, if he knew his conduct might place the officers in reasonable apprehension of a battery, he committed assault. There's a lot of factual details missing from this article. It doesn't specify what actions he took that constituted assault. Say he tried to run in and was restrained, then merely struggled for a couple of seconds to get loose. That'd be hard to swing as assault because the officers would not have been in "reasonable apprehension" of a battery and struggling to get loose likely does not constitute a threat of battery. But if he grabbed a lead pipe and started taking swings at officers, then he definitely committed assault. I suspect his actions were more like the latter than the former example, simply because the police deal with these situations often and usually do not arrest people for being out of sorts over a pet's death. He did something to piss them off. Maybe not something deserving a felony prosecution, but something beyond what a normal, upset person would do in that situation.Without more facts we can't infer whether he had the appropriate state of mind, but I also see nothing indicating that he lacked it. Considering that the mens rea requirement is unaffected by how upset he was about his dog, I don't think that will be at issue in this case. The outcome is much more likely dependent on how extreme the specific conduct that constituted the assault was. As I described above, there are significant legal and moral differences between a short burst of hysterical resistance and threatening deadly violence. The extremity of his behavior can also provide evidence about his state of mind; the more extraordinary his actions the more likely it is that he intended to commit assault.	0.0

I went through this article. I could not disagree with it more.why are people leaving the church? Lots of reasons. None of the true reason to have anything to do with "a dead language" or because we're not as modern or hip or whatever somebody thinks we're supposed to be. the Bible really does say that those who are not born again hates those of us who are because they are children of the devil and we are children of God.  that is going to cause conflict. If you're not sure you believe that, first of all go through the Scriptures on the differences between Christians and non-christians. Then go street witnessing.  another reason in that people are leaving the church could very well be because there's no power in the church they are attending. I'm talking about the true honest power of the Holy Ghost. The church there in can be any denomination but it would be filled with so much deadness that they don't see any reason to stay.  there are some the nominations in the United States where the entire group is as dead as a hammer. There are denominations were God hasn't been anywhere near them in years. Nothing's happening there. There are No examples there. Nobody is living the true Christian life there.  that I mean the people they go to church with her every bit as wicked and sinful as everybody in the world who doesn't go to church at all.one must also add that there is also the possibility that this or that individual has left a particular church because that individual wants to continue in whatever similar in and still be called a Christian. It could be that individual just wants to continue in sin.	0.0

Oh, I'd definitely start with the Fountainhead. It's much easier going and reads more like a novel - Atlas Shrugged has much more of the manifesto feel to it. I don't know if they're going to anger you - for me I think what made me immune to annoyance at them was that I didn't take the ideology remotely seriously. In fact, I didn't know that I was supposed to. I'm not American and grew up in a very, *very* socialist European country. When the characters started reeling off their more extreme neo-liberal beliefs, tbh I just treated those as part of the dystopian setting. I had no clue there were people out there that took this sort of stuff seriously and could have been blown over with feather when I found out there were!What I liked about the books was the combination of dystopian fantasy with an epic feel. I'm a huge fan of fantasy (which is also probably why I'm more easygoing about the endless descriptions and general droning that other people complain about - that's just part of the worldbuilding!) But these books felt really fresh and new to me, because instead of being set in a parallel fairyland they were set in a hypothetical future of our world. I loved that. As for whether they helped me round my perspective of different ideologies, well, I dunno. I read them when I was 20 and while they definitely affected my political thinking, they in no way made me less left-wing - so I guess yes? For me it made a huge, huge difference that Rand herself grew up in Russia and fled for the US because of the revolution. Although I'm honestly rather sympathetic to communism as an ideology, I can definitely see how somebody who lived through that particular application of the theory might not be great fan - so I found it really interesting to see the world through the eyes of somebody pushed by their experiences to the opposite extreme. And well, they definitely helped me not become so annoyingly smug I judge people on their favourite books, so that's a nice plus :PEdit: just as a psa, the sex scenes are rather rapey. That I did not like. I think it's clear that they're not meant to be taken as actual rape, because we get to see what's happening through the eyes of the heroine and she's clearly enjoying what's going on, but given that in the real world people can't mind-read and our hero has no way of knowing she's secretly into it, it was rather disturbing.	0.0

Am I the only who thinks Bishop Sankey is actually good? He had a 3.7YPC last year (which is bad), but with like 2.4 yards after contact (good for 14th best in the league). Also Bishop’s 29 missed tackles on 152 total carries was one of the leagues best missed tackle to carry ratios in 2014. His 29 missed tackles in 2014 were actually more than: Jeremy Hill, Tre Mason, Carlos Hyde, Isaiah Crowell.He played pretty well individually despite being behind a horrid offensive line. I think Mariotta opens things up and Sankey has a much better year than most people are expecting. I think the David Cobb hype is a bit unrealistic.	0.0

Nothing is mandatory. It's a meaningless statement. I don't need a cover for my seat. It could be metal. This is EXACTLY what the video is implying. You could have brought your own glass, right?

Honestly, I think the title is wrong on this post and on WRAL's website.  The Cary man isn't fighting the HOA.  The HOA is fighting the Cary resident to have the flag taken down.  He's well within his rights and he knows it.  I don't want Mr. Bray to be correct in this instance, but he most certainly is.  The downvotes can rain upon me, but the HOA does not have the legal right to make him remove the flag because it's not a free standing flag. It's supported by the structure of his home, which is not explicitly covered by the HOA agreement.  That's it.  End of legal discussion.  The HOA should have hired a better legal adviser to draft the HOA contract (i.e. don't limit yourself to free-standing flag poles because who in the hell puts free standing flag poles in their yards now?).	0.0

After reading more than  I should have about this today, I would not doubt it at all if he was banging whoever he could. As for the one that came forward? IDK. One article checked the timelines and said it all fit so there is the possibility this was true.His Ashley Madison account paid for the "guaranteed affair" and he kept paying for it long after the three month deadline, so he was humping some poor girl other than his wife.

SOMEONE wiped the car clean of prints.  As I posted elsewhere:  In descriptions of the car, this was not a vehicle that was subjected to a weekly detailing. It would have had layer upon layer of fingerprints. The fact that there was so few (and those being on ancillary items like atlas and floral paper) points to the car being wiped down. If you imagine that the perpetrator has possibly committed the crime in this car, moved the body to the trunk (small car, athletic girl...not so easy), driven around Baltimore County with the body in the car ("Man! Wassup with this turn signal?"), taken the body to Leaken for burial, and now is about to hide it in plain sight in a sketchy neighborhood, he/she would want to minimize any evidence that they were in it. If they had ever watched a crime drama on TV the thought might occur to wipe it for prints. "Oh look, here's a T-shirt in the door pocket!" So they give it a thorough going over, steering wheel, gear shift, door handles, latch to open back seat to trunk, etc. ("Should I do that Atlas...nah"), toss the t-shirt on the seat, close up, and catch their ride.	0.0

Everybody says they hate immigration, until a Brit comes along and says he hates all the fucking Poles/Romanians (side note: not me personally) and then you all get upset.This neo liberal agenda you guys have where Europe needs to be a continent where free travel is permitted for any natural born white male or whatever is retarded. Immigration is an issue both within the EU and outside of the EU, and until you guys stop trying to make it a thing about race "muh European Values" and all that crap, the more I'm for this bullshit censorship. I just think it's retarded you all want to talk about immigration, but then get so upset about immigration within the EU and how the EU needs to be completely open, with a unified military and how all European culture is the same.

&gt; You can resell them but theoretically you're supposed to claim that as income and pay taxes on it. Same with a cheeseburger...if you held it and it somehow increased in value, and you sold it, it would be a capital asset and you'd have to pay a capital gain. I don't know what's nonsense about "consuming" a stock (remember, I'm using that term figuratively....don't actually eat the paper).Right.  McDonald's is even in the business of adding value to hamburgers and reselling them.  So we're agreed: there's no particular difference between purchasing a cheeseburger and purchasing a share of MSFT.  So why, again, is it fine to charge people 8% sales tax on the one but totally illegitimate to tax the other even a tiny amount?The cognitive dissonance on this subject is often astonishing.  You called stock purchases "consumption".  Rich people argue in the WSJ all the time that their income shouldn't be taxed, only consumption should be taxed, which coincidentally would shift most of the tax burden to the poor.  And now those same rich people are arguing that their consumption of stock shouldn't be taxed, because.... reasons.  It's almost as if there's no consistent theory here at all except for "don't tax rich people".&gt; Trading is moving to being a zero marginal cost activity, which will greatly increase the ability of the poor and poorly connected to investOh, that's silly.  The barrier to people with no money earning returns from capital isn't a tiny transaction fee; it's that they have no capital.	0.0

Whats wrong with number 1? Its saying 'i don't like this thing, so I don't like the thing responsible for it'. Its not saying that can't exist because of the flood story, it's saying that we think that makes god bad ( if it did exist).Your second example makes more sense when we remember that believers claim their god is perfectly good - so the existence of bad/evil things becomes problematic. Obviously it gets more nuanced than that, as people have been arguing over this one for thousands of years Your third example is not a good argument, I agree. [edit: depending on what the religion claims it might make more sense]Anyway, the best reason to not believe that god exists (and be an atheist) is if you haven't yet seen sufficient evidence for god's existence (or, depending on the god, that we can demonstrate it doesn't exist).	0.0

Are my testicles black?  A male patient is lying in bed in the hospital, wearing an oxygen mask over his mouth and nose. A young student nurse appears to give him a partial sponge bath."Nurse,"' he mumbles from behind the mask, "are my testicles black?"Embarrassed, the young nurse replies, "I don't know, Sir. I'm only here to wash your upper body and feet."He struggles to ask again, "Nurse, please check for me. Are my testicles black?"Concerned that he might elevate his blood pressure and heart rate from worrying about his testicles, she overcomes her embarrassment and pulls back the covers. She raises his gown, holds his manhood in one hand and his testicles in the other. She looks very closely and says, "There's nothing wrong with them, Sir. They look fine."The man slowly pulls off his oxygen mask, smiles at her, and says very slowly, "Thank you very much. That was wonderful.

&gt; By duel I mean 1 on 1.1 on 1 in what space, though? I mean, Mage is very much *urban* fantasy. Once you start chucking around big spells, you're gonna get witnesses. That's the thing- there's *always* a bystander.Mage is at its best when you've got the PCs chucking fireballs at werewolves while engaged in a highway chase and they're being slammed with paradox when they do so.&gt; the examples given are growing claws, gills, altering physical attributes, body armorIt's been *years* since I've gone through the rules, but while the Life Sphere was very powerful, I recall permanent effects being rather difficult to pull off.What I *liked* about Paradox was when you had people trying to figure out ways to do ridiculous things without violating that rule- I remember one PC I had in a campaign that was a super-skateboarder (it was the 90s). They used the Force sphere to pull off incredible tricks without getting slammed with paradox.	0.0

Not really. Basically once he was old enough to act like a "real person" (rather than exclusively being someone to take care of), I moved away for school. Which sort of undid the closeness we had from me taking care of him when he was younger. (I do wish I was home more often to reestablish that type of relationship.) He's still not quite an adult yet (and it seems like you are?) so things could still change for me, and my situation may be different from yours. But you could try gradually interacting more with your siblings and once you feel comfortable enough to do so, let them know how you feel about this. Who knows, they may even feel the same way!I get that doing that may feel so strange that it's out of the question; after falling into the routine of behaving a particular way with someone, it can seem impossible to deviate from it.	0.0

Read up on what secular means?You must at the very least be active in a particular religion not to be secular.&gt;This does not necessarily imply hostility to God or religion, though some use the term this way (see "secularism", below); Martin Luther used to speak of "secular work" as a vocation from God for most Christians. According to cultural anthropologists such as Jack David Eller, secularity is best understood, not as being "anti-religious", but as being "religiously neutral" since many activities in religious bodies are secular themselves and most versions of secularity do not lead to irreligiosity.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularity	0.0

This comment is posted constantly, because it becomes more and more true each year. Every generation, with the exceptional fluke of the Wii, Nintendo is selling less and less consoles. You can't just stick your head in the sand and shrug that off as Nintendoooming naysayers. There's a reason people keep saying it. It's true.Not only is a sign of a slowly diminishing brand, but if you consider that the gaming market is larger than it's ever been, it's even worse. Combine that with the inevitable trouncing that mobile gaming has been giving their flagship portables (are we also going to pretend like this isn't happening?), and you get a grim forecast of a company that won't go bankrupt overnight, but one that will gradually become a distant memory.	0.0

Ho Chi Minh did appeal to the United States for assistance (as did many others), but he was not pro-American any more than it served his goals. Ho was a Stalinist and a nationalist seeking support to prevent the return of France.He did try to see Woodrow Wilson and other world leaders at the Versailles peace conference in 1919 to appeal for Vietnamese 'self-determination'. But he did not get near them, much less meet them. Wilson never saw his appeal. Ho went on to live in Paris and join the communist party. He then lived in the USSR and trained at the Comintern at the height of the Stalinist purges and 'cult of personality'. It did not put Ho off. He would pen an emotional eulogy for Stain in 1953.Ho did work with several OSS agents during WWII, though they did not do so until after the Soviet-German split and Moscow joined the Allied powers. They did not want to contradict Soviet policy. In Sept 1945, Ho did of course cite the American declaration of independence in his declaration of independence -- he also quoted the French declaration of the rights of man. Why? France and the US were the two powers capable of preventing a widening of war in Vietnam. Many historians will also note that he sent a telegram to Truman asking for assistance against France in 1946. They all neglect to mention, or perhaps do not know, that Ho sent the same appeal to Stalin. I'll also note that the image of Ho was and is highly manicured, from the plain suit, the fake tears at official ceremonies, his preference for cheap vietnamese cigarettes (he really like American ones), or his young wife. Just as the communist party disbanded itself in 1945 because of its unpopularity, so too did the DRV want to push this idealized version of Ho at first. That soon changed when the party came into the open, then he was exalted as a communist. He was later powerless, a figure head for the regime in the 1960s taken over by more hardline elements. Ho was relegated to making trips to across the Soviet bloc, to North Korea to visit Kim Il Sung.In the end, Ho was communist, nationalist, and a strategist. Some American diplomatic historians want to look for lost opportunities and imagine a world where Truman supported Ho and thirty years of horrible war were avoided. There is a reasonable impulse there, the US government did contradict its principles and let Cold War imperatives guide its actions. But when Ho was a communist, as were many others in the Indochinese Communist Party who desired a Marxist state. Ho was dependent for support from many of the hardline ICP members. Moreover, since 1945, a war was already raging in Vietnam, between communist and non-communist Vietnamese fighting for control of the post-colonial state. That civil war had begun in the 1930s in colonial prisons and in southern China among competing Vietnamese revolutionaries. In 1945 it simply came into the open.	0.0

I have a ton of these peeps in my family -- and those people show what's necessary to scrape by at the low level:1. Multiple wage-earners in a house.2. Don't even think about college. Just start earning early.3. Almost always: **not minimum wage**. I know 3 families of undocumented workers very intimately, and many more enough to know their working conditions (because of our family network) and zero people of working age in those families are working within 2 dollars of minimum wage!How do they consistently find non-minimum-wage work? The two most common strategies seem to be:1. **Do very unpleasant work.** Work in dairy farms (for undocumented workers) for 10-12 hours per day including Christmas day, including when it's -10 degrees outside, making $12-14/hr. Or work on the kill floor gutting hogs (for workers with good enough documents, paying into social security incidentally), and making up to a union $18/hr.2. **Go where the work is.** Many of these people are incredibly mobile from year to year, even some families. They hear from their friends/family network about work, and/or are directly recruited from their network. And even those that stick to a single place, originally moved there for work, or were the union of two single people who individually moved there/had families that moved where work was.But we're still talking about people who are making $10/hr at least.Yes, responsibility and savings etc are necessary.But I don't think there's any getting around the fact that you literally cannot live on your own, on minimum wage, without doing something crazy like living in homeless shelters and finding your food from dumpster diving.So for people who aren't mobile, say, and simply live in a bad job market -- they may well be royally screwed.	0.0

"It's a simple reminder to the child that they are not in charge and it's time to listen." Great. Too bad that's not how parenting works. Children don't care if they're "in charge," or not. A parent-child relationship that involves showing dominance is not a good parent-child relationship, it's a controlling and abusive one. The fact of the matter is, that if you resort to any sort of violent behavior against your child, then you are a not a good parent. It's a false lesson. When your parents spanked you for doing something bad, they are not teaching you that you did something bad. They are teaching you that you will be spanked if you do something bad.And the result? I don't know. Maybe you realize you did something bad now, maybe you don't. Maybe you still do it, maybe not. Maybe whenever you think of doing something bad you remember your spankings and instinctually avoid such behavior. But I would be lying if I didn't say spanking is a ridiculously untrustworthy and temporary method, and probably does more harm than good.	0.0

TCW is supposed to show us Anakin in his prime when he's a hero of the Republic.  The movies show us Anakin before and after that period.  He was a great Jedi for the Clone Wars because the conflict allowed him to focus on just being a warrior.  Nothing in Anakin's character was ever very well suited for the philosopher/mediator side of a Jedi's existence, and with the Clone Wars in full swing he could ignore those aspects and just be a warrior.  Before the conflict he couldn't really *fit* himself into the life a Jedi peacekeeper because he wasn't well suited to it.  And at the end of the war not only was he about to see the defining era of his life fade out but was faced with the death of Padme- who was his only real link to anything other than war.  Without Palpatine's manipulation he might well have been able to outgrow his focus on being a great warrior, but he would have had to deal with one hell of a "who am I now that I don't have a war to fight?" crisis.	0.0

they pay attention to it because people are foolish enough to post exploits here. that's the whole extend tho.if you're operating on a shoe-string budget with no real stable revenue, you'll ignore every issue that eats dev time that you can. "not on the official forums? not an issue" is one option to pick then.this is why it is pointless to post here and important to do so on the official forums. yes, you have to battle lethargy, trolls and apologists there, but if you bothered writing something up, dont just throw it in the bin.on some issues, reddit is just as much of an echo chamber as the official forums are, but there is one big difference - what we write about here can and will be vastly ignored by DE without much ado. on the official forums, they have to react in one way or another.	0.0

Their video seems to tell the tragic tale of a group of 20-something kids who just got picked up by a major record label.  They fly to California to film a video, with looks on their faces that scream, "We're going to be huge pop stars!"  Tragic, because all of them are probably in dead end jobs and have kids now, and whenever they reminisce about the good ol' days, no one even knows who 'Len' is.  Whenever the topic comes up, they have to sing a few bars until the listener nods his head, like, "Yeah, I kinda remember that one."  But what inevitably follows is "What other songs did you guys do?"  Joy turns to sadness, and they try to shift the conversation to another topic.Such a sad song.	0.0

I never found that information indicative of a good game though. How many games have you missed because they didn't at least get a seven out of 10?

Radical liberals are the most irrational fuck-wits on the planet. They're far worse then the religious-right ever was when it comes to bullshit moral crusades and thought policing. At least Christianity has some concept of forgiveness, if you cross the line on some left issue (racism, sexism, etc) you'll wish there was a god just so there'd be something to help you. Not fond of the idea of "original sin", how about white privilege or the patriarchy instead. The attitudes and behavior taken by liberals mirrors religious fervor in an uncanny way. It's like you can't escape the systems of social control, just put different costumes on them. Try suggesting that single parent-homes are detrimental to child development, or that a lot of poor people bear some responsibility for their situation to a liberal. Then compare that reaction to the one you get when you suggest that gay people should have the same rights to marry as straight people to a conservative. Not to mention the idealism without any practicality among liberals. Hey let's bury the entire country in mind-boggling debt because everyone deserves EVERYTHING for nothing, and it's not like you actually have to pay for things the government gives out right?

At the end of the day, using your analogy, if a driver hits a pedestrian, THEY get charged or have to deal with some sort of legal issues.  It is usually 100% the drivers fault.  Do we teach children to look both ways? Of course, but if you get hit by a car it is still the driver's fault.  So I really don't understand how your analogy could have anything to do with rape unless you (rightfully) agree that the rapist or assaulter is in the wrong.  Unfortunately when it comes to rape and sexual assault, the person being assaulted is usually still blamed in some form or another. They "were asking for it", "got too drunk", "seemed to be into it", etc.  Somehow we are still not blaming the person who actually decided to fucking assault someone.	0.0

Just a quick point, but the GTX970 wasn't ROP bound to start with - there aren't enough SMMs to feed all of them, so even if you knocked another 4 ROPs off it would have no impact on performance.Any legal issue would have to be based on the memory bus, as that's the area a theoretical performance hit could occur. Even then, there's a method of achieving the listed peak throughput (interleaving the read/writes), and as Maxwell relies more heavily on its cache than previous generations it's not immediately apparent what the real-world performance impact, if any, would be.So far as we know, Nvidia hasn't cheated any benchmarks (eg, through driver hacks), which is what separates it from [your Intel example](http://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/2u7o5o/amazon_us_and_uk_have_stopped_selling_some_of_the/co67i5q) - they made a mistake on a technical supplement, but the performance is what was expected regardless.To put it another way, if a truck goes from 0 to 60 in 3 seconds, does the end user care how thick the transmission link cable is?

This seems so wrong on their part and pretty unexpected.The shipment is not your responsibility in the slightest. It seems like you've been a little to nice. You let them know that you have nothing to do with the shipment and that you shouldn't be penalized for something that never even made it to your door.After getting the run around that you've gotten I would start looking in to other places to port my number, tell them you'll issue a chargeback on all charges not just the phone because the service was never delivered on unless they send you out a new phone.Normally I wouldn't do stuff like this but the phone never even made it to you. I can't emphasize enough how this shouldn't be your problem. Any reputable company would immediately send out a new shipment. I think the problem is you got a bad first rep and now no one wants to shake up the process that;s already been started. If it was simple enough for you to call FedEx and find out the package was empty it should be just as simple for them . I know they have a system for stuff like this but it's more for the phone was delivered and didn't require a signature and someone stole it off your doorstep. The fraud prevention isn't for things that can be confirmed lost in the mail. Put a truncated version of this on their twitter and you'll get results quickly.Something like: "Hey Verizon. Fedex confirms my iphone you sent me is lost. Why am I being punished by paying for service while not having the phone I paid for?"	0.0

A couple of things: Kirkwall was not in any way the representation of "the BEST" of the Chantry. Even long before the Qunari arrived it was well known that Kirkwall was the worst possible place for mages and had the worst-maintained Circle. In fact, it was just an incredibly shitty city all around, and its shitty history predates the founding of the Andrastean Chantry. I mean, this is a place called the City of Chains that was known for its brutal treatment of slaves. The first thing you see when arriving at the place by sea is the Gallows.If you do your investigations you find all kinds of weird magical shit and disturbances in the Veil happening all over Kirkwall and in the surrounding areas, and it's theorized that this is because of Corypheus's influence since he was imprisoned nearby. It's a fact that even while asleep, his dreaming mind could reach out and influence other people, especially people who were attuned to the Fade like mages and anyone using lyrium. It's therefore likely that it was actually partially because of Corypheus that the messed-up events you describe happened, although the city was, as I said, already a bastion of injustice and suffering long before the Chantry arrived. No matter what the city was a representation of the worst of Thedas, and we have firsthand knowledge from many people that the Circles elsewhere were actually pretty nice.Second of all, you assume a whole lot about what is going on in the decade that transpires during DA2. That everyone is doing "NOTHING" - well, we don't really see what anyone does because the game fast-forwards over so much, but how do you know that everyone from Elthina to the Divine did "NOTHING" the whole time? Certainly they didn't make any huge sweeping changes but the only time we ever see Elthina doing nothing is during the scene at the beginning of Act 3, and there she didn't really do "NOTHING", she prevented a riot from happening.Finally, there is the claim that Anders did the "right thing". Terrorism and murder is never the answer. If Anders had killed Orsino or Meredith there might be some degree of retribution there for their complicity in the atrocities, but Elthina literally had nothing to do with the stuff happening in the Circle, blaming her for mages getting raped is like blaming the governor for what some cops are doing in some small town in the state. Elthina was actually the least responsible person in the whole scenario, and that was precisely the point - by picking someone who was truly innocent, Anders was removing the possibility of reconciliation. If he had, say, blown up Meredith, then the mages may have forgiven the templars for everything because the head conspirator was dead. He actually says this almost verbatim in the game, I don't see how you could have missed that. This is exactly the ideology of a terrorist, not to mention all of the other innocent people Anders murdered in the bombing who had nothing at all to do with any of this.It's not just despicable but frankly insane his motivation here, and that's a fact that's acknowledged even by the other mages who support Anders, including even Hawke if you are playing a mage Hawke that's pro-rebellion. For fuck's sake it's even acknowledged by Anders if he is a rival to you - he flat-out admits he is slowly losing his mind, has memory loss, and that Vengeance is taking over more frequently and he cannot stop him. What Anders did in fact was not just "the right thing", but also one of the worst things that could have happened for the mages, because he removed the ability to choose from the other mages. They could no longer attempt negotiation or compromise, they either had to join the rebellion or get killed, except in rare cases of mages with political power like Vivienne. For trying to help the mages as you claim, Anders likely killed way more innocent mages than all of the templars in the entire history of Kirkwall combined - this was a continent-spanning rebellion. Remember, Anders didn't just make it so that innocent mages were being hunted down by templars and seekers - he also forced mage to kill mage, as the Loyalist mages who didn't want war and were outvoted were forced to defend themselves from the rebels.The fact that you can say that a woman who was trying to maintain peace "had to go" is pretty disgusting. I mean, I supported the mage rebellion in both games and had a mage Warden that liberated the Circle in Ferelden, but I acknowledge that Anders was an insane murderer, as does... literally every single person in the Dragon Age universe, even Anders himself as he offers his neck to the sword.	0.0

If you were having trouble paying off your credit cards (pre-YNAB debt not withstanding) then that means you were overspending in some category. It would be helpful to look back over the last few months (especially in months where you couldn't pay off your credit card in full) and scrutinize the spending. Look at your category balances; are any of them in the red?One of the things I had to adjust when starting YNAB was to look at the category balance, NOT at bank account balance or available credit when deciding if I can afford to purchase something. It's easy to say "I have 2000 available to put on this card, and 1000 saved in my checking account,  so I can buy this thing." The whole purpose of assigning dollars jobs is that you know exactly how much you really have available to spend on a certain category.If it was something you had to buy (car repair, security deposit, medical bill) then you need to pull money from other categories to cover that spending. If it was something you could do without, then it is a matter of cutting back your spending.If you feel that you really can't handle the temptation of a credit card (especially since now they are already canceled, and any damage to your credit score is done) then it might be best for you to not have a credit card until you get used to checking category balances and not account balances. Just be careful about overspending still, just because you can't put stuff onto a credit card, its still possible to overspend, or spend money that is supposed to be going to a different job.Hope that makes sense!	0.0

I am a superman fan but I do love the bats. The thing that gets me the most about superman is, even though he is an alien and "super," he is a picture of what it really means to be human. If you think he is always a goody good check out the JMS series earth one. Also he was raised by middle American, country valued, working class parents. (Which is also what I kind of don't like about people saying batman is relatable because I still have my parents and I'm poor so...there's that...) he also has all of the knowledge of krypton so that makes him extremely intelligent. And he also gets tired (Kingdom comes.) Supes is extremely relatable and also, to me, something that people (in the dcu) can look up to and is a real superHERO.Edit 1: [Cool instance](http://geekxgirls.com/article.php?ID=3029)Edit 2: [a little something for the bat crazies](http://imgur.com/a/da7iC)	0.0

Preface, you definitely cannot use Nikon Commander Mode with a Canon speedlight. That doesn't mean you cant trigger it though.A) Use a 'dumb' sync cable. Center pin to fire only. This will work no problem.B) Use a 'dumb' wireless trigger, such as a pocket wizard or similar. This is only using the center pin to fire, so again, no problem.C) get an optical slave trigger for the 580EXII - they're tiny little pc-sync bugs that you can just attach to the flash. For some stupid reason Canon decided against building this in? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ This won't take advantage of your Nikon 'commander mode' though.Check out [FlashZebra](http://www.flashzebra.com/opticalslaves/index.shtml) for the optical slave addons. I'm sure you can find radio triggers or a long dumb sync cable with a pretty easy google search :)Edit: holy formatting batman	0.0
At the end of the day, it's calories in vs. calories out. That's it. There's more specialized diets you can do but that's the core idea, it's just the science of the body. I can tell you as someone who tried and failed several times to lose weight before seeing results is that there's no trick to it. If you're coming from a sedentary lifestyle with a diet of convenience then yeah, it's going to suck ass for a little while. You may not see it at first, but the weight will come off. Someone in your life may give you a passing remark of "Hey, you look like you've lost a little!" That's an awesome feeling-- having others recognizing your progress. Even if they don't though, you are losing the weight for YOU. You can't make it a question of "Can I lose the weight?" That gives you two options, and you only need one. You can't make it a question, it has to be a statement that you tell yourself. "I will lose the weight." I can promise you from firsthand experience that all of the cravings and crappy feelings of self image will melt away with your fat. Sorry I'm ranting, but I've been thinking a lot about this lately and ultimately the reason I'm 95lbs down and counting is because I didn't ask myself if I could do it, I told myself I had to. This whole weight loss thing is 90% mental.	0.0

It's obvious he has an asian fetish, so let's address how shitty of a partner he sounds like without that fact as the basis.He is constantly comparing you to other women. You are being commodified right here, as if your worth is innately tied to your looks. While looks are important to a relationship, this is enforcing the idea that looks are basically what you are worth to him when you should be more than just that. It also throws in the seed of doubt that he's got a foot out the door, cause he's constantly comparing you for "hotter models". This is a shitty thing to do.Two, he is stereotyping you based on race. This is the baseline of racism. You aren't an individual, you are a carbon copy of a racial stereotype; you love small things or shopping? All asian women are like this, this isn't a trait of your individuality. You aren't a person to him, but a collection of traits asian women hold.Three, when you bring it up he gets defensive and leaves angry. He is refusing to communicate at all on the subject, which is something NECESSARY in a relationship. It's childish as fuck. It also illuminates the fact that he's more interested in bitter denial of his personal faults than his interest in letting you be comfortable in the relationship. Childish and selfish.Basically, every major point you brought up points to yes and he's a terrible partner regardless of his fetish.	0.0

A bit of a tangent, but... My 90s porn story involved getting a helpdesk call at the ISP I worked for to see why a user's email account wasn't working on their dialup connection. Turns out it was stuffed full of file attachments, and it was just taking a long time for him to download. We asked him if he wanted us to save the files out and he could grab them individually from the FTP site. He said yes. We thought maybe someone was messing with him, sending him unsolicited images to DOS his email... However, he knew they were coming."Hey, there's a lot of images in there - are you expecting those?"  "Yes. I need those"  About a hundred files, and based on the one file opened accidentally by a tech and the names of the files, all kiddie porn.At the time,  there was no precedent, but there was a trial, and this guy who was a civilian member of  the local police ended up with a 30 day jail term served on weekends. The guy who sent him the images was apparently an actual cop, but neither of them worked for the police after that.	0.0

Well, it depends mostly on what you are feeling is pulling you down. Is it your endurance or speed (or both)? If I take a look at the distances and times. I would say that it is mostly speed, but endurance is an issue. Let me explain:Your 400 in 1.05, means that if you could run it for 1600m you would run it in 4.20. This gives you 40 spare seconds to play with, a flat race is a good race so each lap 10 seconds added, means 1.15 per lap (or your pace for the 800m).Now for your 5K in 20 min, to be honest, it is not shabby but not great either. It means that your base pace is 4 min per KM, maybe a bit higher. But you can run a semi-decent 5 and I wanna bet a semi-decent 10K (&lt; 45 min, if not you should really try to focus on endurance). But your 1.05 is more shocking than your 5K, at least for me. Your build/lifting tells me you should be a fast over endurance guy, but the 400m time points in a other direction.Before reading any advice below, remember that the most important thing to **follow is your body**, stop if it hurts or aches along time after the training and take appropriate resting periods. Because non of us know what your base is/how injury prone you are. Now up for training tips: from your reaction I see that your body probably doesn't like running long distances (for an extended periods of time), so I have tried to keep that in mind. **Speed:**This should be done mainly for upcoming runs (like 2 months in advance of the competition, but it is fine to do once in a while in the off season, to keep your speed up). Option 1: The speedy Conzales150 meter, set a cone every 50 meter:- you sprint from cone 1 to cone 2, when I say sprint I mean SPRINT- the next 50 meter you relax and run fast, almost gliding-like, you consume much less energy but the pace is still high- the last 50 you sprint again- walk back- sprint the entire 150 meter, measure your timeRest up, until your heartbeat is low (think &lt;120 per sec. but it depends) or 2 min have passed. Repeat 6 to 10 times depending on your condition. See what your time does, only the last one, maybe two are allowed to be significantly slower, otherwise rest up more.Option 2: 200 is my lucky numberRun a 200 meter at your 800m tempo, measure the time. Now that time minus 3 secs (I estimate 35 - 36 secs) is your target for the next 10 x 200m's.You run 200 meter in this set time, jog the next 100 meter and walk the last 100 meter and you start the next 200 meter. Don't worry if you cant make the time, but try to keep yourself out of comfort pace, otherwise it is a useless training.Option3: The stairway to heavenA training geared more towards enduranceStart with a 200 m do this in 35 secs. Jog, walk until feeling easy again or after 2 min of rest. Next do a 400 m in 1.20 - 1.25. Jog/rest again, after resting finish with a 600 m in 2.05-2.10. Rest for 2 min. Repeat  4x times. This equals 5K, for a speed training a lot of distance**Endurance:**Option 4: The stairway to hellVery easy to follow:- run 1K at a nice pace (4 min) rest up 3 min- run 2K at a nice pace (8.30) rest up 3 min- run 3K at a nice pace (13 min) rest up 5 minrepeat once, you just ran 12K. If you are a daredevil do it as not 1-2-3-1-2-3 but 1-2-3-2-1-1-2-3-2-1 (that is a pain in the ass crack)Option 5: 800 is my lucky numberYou can probably guess it this is focused on the 800. Run a 800 in 3.20 with 1-2 minutes breaks in between 3 times. Rest up for 4 min and repeat this series 4 times.Option 6: BORING (or you should run in the forest/city)Run 10K at a comfortable pace in at least make sure it is not done in 1.15 or higher ( under the hour is preferable, but make sure you don't push yourself very hard). It is long, if your body doesn't like it, don't this training.**Combined:**Option 7: I am gonna run 300m until I fall down at your doorRun 300m at a pace just above or at your 800m pace, next walk 100m (completing the lap). Repeat this 10x and rest up Now you do this again only at a slightly lower speed, rest up again (5 - 7 min is very much ok)Now you do it again at a speed that is fast but it doesn't have to be your 800m paceYou have now ran 9K, with speed. This takes a lot from you, don't underestimate! If you can't finish the last series don't worry, you will after awhile (and quite possibly you ran too fast in the first series).Option 8: time is my friendThis is a reverse-pyramid run: run for 6 min, walk 3 min run for 5 min, walk 2.5 min...run for 2 min, walk 1 minrun for 2 min, walk 1 min...run for 5 min, walk 2.5 minrun for 6 min, walk 3 minYou should run at a pace( your 5K in 20 pace, I think), but you now run that for 40 min total, so 10K which very nice.Always end your training with a **cookie**A cookie is a series of 3 x (20m - 40m - 60m) acceleration to get the lactic acid out of your system and to once again focus on that all important speed.A last tip I can give you is to work on your posture/form during your running, but this really hard if you don't have someone to observe your running. But a squicky rule of thumb:- if you run easy(light on your feet, your shoulders and core relaxed) then it is usually good- you run symmetrical, meaning everything on the left and right moves according to the same pattern and rhythm. The worst counterexample is someone that has his head hanging to the left and his right arm and shoulder are correcting by moving more wildly.- your chest is not dented and your chin is not trying to make out with your neck (so you can breath freely). Most trainers want your chest to be pushed forward almost to painful extend this is not critical, your neck/head is, since this easily hampers you breathing without knowing. A runner staring at the ground is a defeated runner. I hope I have helped, if you have any questions please ask. Best of luck with the running.p.s. these are some of my old training schemes, which I have tweaked a bit to suit your speed/endurance, if one may prove to be easy or very difficult adjust the times to meet your standards.	0.0

Probably but enough to make blanket statements about the sexuality of all men? She also mentions that she was in the kink environment before going professional, so even her experiences then could be biased.Keep in my she's appealing to her authority as an expert on the subject of sex, having had some boyfriends before doesn't give her expert knowledge on male sexuality in a more general sense.Over all I just dislike appeals to ethos, even as a dominatrix I think she should have looked into some statistics to prove that the trends that she's seeing does indeed apply to the general male population.	0.0

but it will mean the game won't have any particular areas of danger that you don't know, such as the lave cluster, isn't that part of the game? by all means play how you want but I'd see it as a part of a game where I have to solve a problem with a solution that is something other than going to solo; again, it's your game and I don't condone their actions, I'm just saying there are jerks in real life and you sometimes have to deal with them one way or another.

Strictly speaking "guys" is a casual American English term meaning "a group of males". But casual American English doesn't have a term that means "a group of people of unspecified gender" (the closest thing would be "y'all" which is specifically a southern term), so "guys" gets commandeered to do the job.On the topic of whether or not "you guys" used in this way is appropriate, there's more than you probably care to read on the topic [here](http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/03/21/hey_guys/) and [here](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2200)(skip to the comment section).	0.0

&gt; How so? Reddit is one of the most anti-feminist websites I can think of on the internet I believe you are mistaken. Reddit is very much against radical feminism. Not against 'neutral' second wave feminism. &gt;feminism is about equalityFor women specifically. Feminism works from the perspective of women. Feminism is about equality, but more so for women than for men, instead of both. So, it's not *entirely* about true equality. &gt;whether someone self-identifies as one or not is largely meaningless.I hope by that you do not assume that people who are for equality are feminists regardless of whether they label themselves as such, because this very much sounds like a very subtle "if you're for equality you're a feminist".	0.0

**There are no rules.** That implies that there's a perfect standard of life, and there isn't one. The only goal is living/reproducing and the means by which you achieve that are irrelevant. Every aspect of our existence is luck/chance/randomness. It wasn't predetermined that thick fur would be ideal for animals in cold places, or that animals who perspire can live in hot places. It's just what happened.I've described the process of natural selection, are you reading my responses to you? There are no "solutions". No mutation is "better" than another. If it works, it works. There are multiple types of mutations that can make an environment livable for an animal, and there's not one winner. The mutations occur by chance; it's also by chance that certain mutations work better in certain environments and get to survive.	0.0

1. Endgame is relying way too heavy on RNG. People DO NOT WANT to run 72s on their 93 lvl characters, they will just quit.2. Why the fuck must I play the game if it doesn't reward me even for a slightest bit? A bunch of my friends which I tried to drag into PoE quit because "no fucking drops whatsoever, better play some diablo/warframe/dota".3. Standard economy is ruined not because of item flood but because of legacy uniques and sloppy GGG decisions such as initially cheap multimod or hybrid mod on weapons (why did they remove it then, new mastercrafted weapons will be way worse than old because old ones  have hybrid mod on them). Sadly GGG is afraid to remove all legacy uniques and rares with legacy mods (because it will force a massive ragequit)...&gt; I'd get more enjoyement from the game actually dropping me an exalt, dropping me Doomsower or some other good unique that I could trade for Doomsower. Right now PoE is league of trading in low level currency, with pyramid like scheme, and nothing more. Everything is designed around that.These are the golden words.

That niche will be yoiur solution. Remember, we sell things because we want to solve other people's problems, not just for money.

So... you are complaining that there isn't enough diversity on this subreddit, but refuse to offer your own theological view because you don't want to be down voted? You have the audacity to criticize this subreddit even though your comment seems to allude to the fact that you are new here. Perhaps what you think indeed does need to be expressed and  should be, but not in such a condescending way. I think individuals are receptive to all types of religious opinions as long as you don't present them as an attack on what is foundational to their being. You already set up barriers of discussion by criticizing people of faith who lean left on most social issues, but perhaps religion to you is about setting limits and remaining static, but the great theological challenge of our time is to shift our image of God from the micro level of operating in our day to day lives, to the macro level where God and divinity are the spirit of the cosmos, facilitating supernova events that allow the wondrous burst of elements into the atmosphere that is foundational to every sentient being. God does not care whether or not you believe in God, only that you do God. There is no one watching you in the sky, there is no force that has any sort of Clausian surveillance over you, and doing God means first and foremost to protect the Sacred Reality, and the first holy book of every religion. The Book of NaturePerhaps instead of thinking you're the victim of the liberal agenda devaluing your ideas, it is your attitude and the way in which you express your ideas that effects their reception. Whether or not this subreddit is particularly diverse is irrelevant.. I'm sure it is equally diverse to reddit as a whole. I have particularly out there ideas, and I'm sure you may downvote me and say I didn't really address the problem, but perhaps in my willingness to express myself honestly, you will also find that willingness.	0.0

&gt; integers larger than 1 that are only divisible by themselves and 1This is not a very good definition for what a prime number is. Note that 17 is divisible by -1 (or you have a very unusual definition for *divisible*). So with your definition, 17 should not be considered prime. So we should probably add the negative divisors in the definition, and while we are at it, we should not restrict ourselves to positive numbers.&gt; Is there any better reason that a number such as -17 isn't considered prime?There is none, because -17 should really be considered as a prime number. The fundamental definition of a prime number is not the one you are using.  Here it is :A number n is prime if it is not zero, not invertible and if *(for any p and q, if n divides pq then n divides p or n divides q)*This is a definition that can be generalized for any set where you have addition and multiplication (more precisely, any commutative ring). Invertible integers are the elements x such that x^(-1) is also an integer, so only 1 and -1 fit this definition. (But for for general commutative ring, there could be a lot more invertible elements).With this definition, it is obvious that if n is a prime number then -n is also a prime number.	0.0

A few suggestions which, combined, should make customizing your base easier:  * make "place" and "decorations" at the top of the menu instead of "Purchase" and "functions"  * make tablet menus go back by hitting 'x' rather than having an "exit" option at each part of the menu.  * allow placable items and "delete item" to be registered to item slots  * remove the confirm question from "delete item"  * increase number of slots to which items can be registered to at least six(for 4 directional tiles, tablet, and delete all easily accessed)  * While I'm suggesting messing with registers, could you make the Instant Lapras pack activate without any button presses simply by walking onto water, and make hitting 'c' facing water automatically use the best fishing rod available?  * weirdly shaped decorations that are better for making walls  * also, here's a bug: using any portal in the "cyan caverns" type base makes bridges cease to function(you cannot walk on them, you can use surf facing them, their graphics go over the player's)  Thanks for taking the time to read our suggestions!	0.0

I didn't vote for Obama, and really just don't vote in general (although I did vote once to support medical marijuana). However, I will be voting for Bernie.Does he have all the same political stance as me? Of course not. Not even close. But, he does have a respectable platform, and a history to back up that he does what he says he's going to do. I've never seen that before in any mainstream candidate in my 18 years of being eligible to vote.And of course he won't make congress bipartisan. Nobody is claiming that he will, and quite frankly comments that suggest that the makeup of congress should determine who you think the best presidential candidate are baffle me. Who gives a fuck if he can actually get things done, if he's at least trying. No other presidential candidate is even going to try to help the working class.We aren't going to be able to flip a switch and have an anarcho-communist society. If we are to ever get there it will come from one of two routes, either from society rebuilding itself after a total system collapse, or from a gradual slide over several generations to the left.I see Bernie as a chance to start that gradual slide. It's not perfect, but personally, for my sake, and my children's sake, I'd prefer the gradual slide to the hardships that we'd face after a total system collapse.	0.0

Things my boss thinks or has said to me:* He wants a synopsis of everything I've done every day, then complains when it's too technical sounding, even though I'm both a full-stack dev and sysadmin and apparently stupidly simple for me is still too complex to him. When I tried to explain things to him he stated he didn't care about the details so long as the company is getting income.* He can barely tell the difference between Java, PHP and Javascript, and thinks PHP is so amazing just because it's popular. In his words, "It wouldn't be popular if it was insecure."* He also thinks that because Windows 10 has had issues with its launch, that C/C++ sucks since most of the core of Windows is written in those.* He thinks HTML forms are semantically equal to database queries. Any logic in-between isn't important.* He thinks MySQL is better than PostgreSQL because MS Access can talk to it easier(?), not really sure on that one.* He thinks choosing PostgreSQL for our next generation of website was a bad idea because I sometimes have to use the command line to modify things. I'm pretty sure he's scared of command lines. * He thinks proper database structure is throwing everything in a few giant tables with "extra" columns for future features. In his old MS Access database he "designed" by himself, there is a 18 column God table with a few F7, F8 and F17 fields that have multiple meanings depending upon context. Plus a couple other smaller god tables that do the same.* He thinks that just because I like to keep software up to date on our server that I'm "on the cutting edge", and blames that for some bugs.* He thinks nginx is for hipsters. I don't get that one.* He has almost zero focus on security, and berates me when I take extra steps for ensuring we or clients don't get screwed over. Luckily I'm pretty thorough with security by myself.* He thought it was a waste of time to integrate Git into our workflow with branches for individual devs or features. Many thousands of commits later and he changed his mind and likes it now. Though isn't willing to use it himself, and he likes to make changes to stuff on the server in-production sometimes.* He thinks some code isn't written correctly because Adobe Dreamweaver CS4 can't open it properly. Or in the case of our Views, Dreamweaver can't even hope to show the WYSIWTF editor for them. So he thinks the code is bad. I personally use WebStorm and PHPStorm, and sometimes PyCharm. JetBrains FTW.That's all I can think of right now. I need a new job. Sorry for the long rant, been meaning to get all that out for a while.	0.0

DMU/EMU = Diesel/Electric Multiple Unit, where each train car generates its own traction. Just like a subway car. They can be paired up for easier acceleration for frequent stop/start service.

I would argue that Skylar is poorly introduced, not written.  They should have at least tried to make her likeable in the first episodes to build sympathy for her later on, but will anyone really ever be able to forget the most detached birthday handjob ever?Otherwise, we need to see more of the stress in her life, before Walt was a drug lord.  Sure they don't make a lot of money, but that doesn't seem to bother anyone but Walt.  Sure, Walt Jr. has CP, but...that never really matters.  It never seems to be a big stress on his parents, and he's largely independent and self-sufficient, and they never worry about Holly having it too (Note:  I know that it is not genetic, that it comes from brain damage during birth, but I have CP, and my mother was told by her doctors that if she had any more children they would likely have it too).And it would have been so easy to make her stress more apparent.  Maybe the pregnancy is really hard and she's constantly ill.  Maybe she keeps having fiction rejected.  I mean, it's referenced like once that Skylar writes, and it's so she can ask Marie about pot.I like Skylar as a foil for Walter, and while I don't agree with her decisions later on, I understand why she makes them.  However, I think the way she was written in the beginning of the show was so horribly bungled that the audience never had a chance to develop sympathy for her, which is why she gets so much hate.	0.0

At the risk of having missed something, I question the use of **Integrated Armor**. The natural bonus, I understand. The part I'm failing to see as anything beyond fluff is the bonding of armor. As the armor becomes a part of you, does it count towards the *you must not be wearing armor* requirement of the natural bonus? I have nothing against it if it is just fluff, but if it isn't, it's not exactly clarified, and thus a newer player (practically like myself) would end up confused.Other than that, I like the changes you've made, they seem very interesting, and the diversification between Scout and Soldier is pretty neat as well, though I question the use of *Relentless Endurance* (only because repeating racials are sort of a buzzkill when I look at races, but that's probably just me).	0.0

Like a step by step plan to marginalize extremists?  I'm not sure if you'd be able to find any consensus on that. Come to think of it, I haven't found much literature on it. There are a lot of contributing factors, but most Islamic sources I've found deal not with alienating extremists, but reintegrating them into the community: informing the imam of their activities, informing law enforcement and sometimes intervening (with law enforcement) in an informal manner. *Most* conservative scholars don't even advocate violence unless it's clear self-defense (or if the Ummah was united). Side note: I wouldn't say most moderates consider the extremists *kafir*. There's are centuries-long debates on whether or not certain sins take a person outside the fold of Islam - the whole faith versus acts thing. I'd say most Muslims don't think the extremists are non-Muslims, we just think they're misguided and that they don't represent Islam.	0.0

How much RAM is in that Z400? Here in /r/homelab, we value the benefits of virtualization in order to gleam as much value from your box as possible. Essentially, this will allow you to stick multiple virtualized servers/workstations in one chassis. Your bottleneck will probably be RAM if you'd like to attempt this, so I would suggest picking up as much as possible with your budget if you'd like to go that route.This will allow you to play with more environments with less gear and when something breaks, spinning up a backup VM takes minutes rather than hours of reconfiguring an OS from scratch.My viewpoint on Linux is maybe less popular than what the rest of reddit may think. Linux in all of its flavors is an excellent skillset to learn the basics of (navigating the command line, creating scripts, installing various components and applications) ...but from an industry perspective, unless you're deliberately aiming towards a linux career it's not all that valuable. By all means spin up a distro of Linux Mint and get yourself accustomed to it, however.I'm not familiar with the nursing informatics major, but it appears to be a major that has you act as a bridge between IT and nursing. That's a field I'd almost rather approach from the perspective of IT first and then nursing! You'll want to give yourself a sense of how IT works from a general sense from top to bottom. As a tip, go look online for basic IT interview questions (helpdesk level) and make it a goal to be able to answer a series of those questions using your lab. Domain controllers, DNS, basic networking, various acronyms, there are tons of topics. Without knowing your existing level of knowledge it'll be hard to assess where you should start.	0.0

I really wished they'd have touched on activities (and their light levels). It probably would have answered a lot of questions.Let's look at some math: we have 9-10 slots for items that contribute to our light level (3 weapons + ghost &amp; 4 armor + Class item + artifact?)Lets say max level content only requires a minimum of 250 light, but items in the game can give you more than that (say 300).If you have 8 slots filled with 300 level gear (2400) then have 2 slots with 160 items (320), then average than (2400 + 320 / 10 slots), that equals 272, which is still above the minimum for the activitiy.I think this allows them for people to run what they like, while giving the min/maxers free ran to keep going.	0.0

you are looking for guidance on what exactly ? Here is my personal belief.Shaivism is about staying attached yet detached at the same time. Attached to your dharma(duty) and detached from desire. Staying detached doesnt mean you shouldnt follow your passion, you should but shouldnt let it run your life, you should be able think extremly objectively and shouldnt let emotion come into your decision making. Shiva is married sadhu, he does his duties to his family while still remaining unaffected by kaama. Occasional meditation/Tapas can help you get to that level of objectivity in your thought process by calming you. A calm mind is an objective mind. Every time you place vibuthi on your forehead remember that everything you know in life will be ash some day so stay away from the worldly illusion and follow a path of righteous duty.	0.0

&gt; DBZ is still objectively power scaled. No it's not. It is power scaled, and nobody can go against that, but we still don't know how much more powerful Cell is than Frieza, or SSJ3 Goku is than Cell. So people make arbitrary estimates and inflate characters abilities even though there is no evidence to substantiate their claims.&gt; I don't think DBZ is that far off that realm of power though by BOTG. It's just not shown. So you're guessing? That's exactly what I said leads to misrepresentation of power. There isn't really evidence to support the idea that anyone in DBZ is near Galactus' level&gt;You can't just pick a picture that has a whole plot leading up to something and be like "this is it, this character can do this" when you later find out it was a special situation/item/power up that let a character be that powerful.But, for most feats, there isn't anything special amping the character, and if there is, it is usually specified that they were amped when it happened. For example, if I were to say that Thor erased Mangog from existence and used it as a feat, I would have to specify that it was Rune King Thor who did it. If I was to say that Thor bested Galactus in single combat, I would have to specify that it was Old King Thor (All Black the All Father, God of Butchers, the Necro-Thor, Eater of World Eaters, Last King of the Dead Earth, more specifically), and not regular Thor (although Thor did drive off Galactus using the Godblast, but it nearly killed them both. OKT didn't need to Godblast). &gt;Using exaggerated/out of context feats is power scaling a character.No, it's misrepresenting their power. Power scaling is using X&gt;Y&gt;Z logic	0.0

Taking him on was also a mistake and it put a lot of women on campus in danger by allowing a guy like that to be on campus without and apparent restrictions or issues.So no, while Sam is the only one to commit a crime here, he's not the only one at fault in all of this.	0.0

police are not judge, jury and executioners. they can't kill someone for not listening to them. the police also have to obey their own rules. they are not above the law. &gt; How about, don't break the law? if you're such a strong proponent of following the law, then you should be a strong supporter of people who are trying to reform the overhanded response of today's police. few people will say that the police have an easy job. however, one of the main components of their job is to interact with the public. these interactions will not always go smoothly, but the police are bound by the law as much as any other citizen. they do not have the legal right to kill someone for disobedience. at no time was Eric Garner a threat to the lives of any of the officers surrounding him. a lethal response, such as a chokehold, should be reserved for lethal situations.	0.0

If an individual cannot function at all in society by him/herself and needs others around to protect themselves and society from harm.That's an incredibly vague description that could be used to apply to a lot of people at different times in their lives.The problem is that, no matter how limited and regulated you make it, you're building the framework for eugenics.Now you have a precedent that makes it appear socially acceptable and that baseline of acceptability is only going to get fuzzier with time as politicians jump at the chance to advance it to their own gain and pet agendas.

I always assumed Abed was the obvious choice. Maybe because it seems too obvious it would be a complete train wreck, but bear (down) with me. Abed structures his life off of pop-culture references and other peoples reactions, making his own character quite a mystery, but we have seen many cases where he has shown a very human side, shedding light on his odd behavior and a deeper pain inside that makes him relatable.Also, considering he is the only character to ever have broken the fourth wall or at least given suspicion that he is in a TV show, wouldn't it  be entertaining to watch him try to make sense of the artificial sitcom world around him because he's probably only one who can make sense of it?I believe that some people on this subreddit have said before that Community is basically a combination of every sitcom, creating a hilarious mockery of traditional television; well as much as I love this world that the show has created, I love even more the skeptical behavior and analytically approach that Abed takes to it.	0.0

Which it is.  I've described it to friends as "a bloody awful motorcycle.  And also a bloody brilliant one."No, I'll probably never max it out.  But the blower gives it incredible thrust at lower speeds, and that's what makes it great.You don't know what I do for a living, but I'll just give you a hint: over more than 30 years I have ridden motorcycles in a professional context.

For one thing, it's important not to confuse 'racial pride' with 'racial superiority'. Being proud of what your ancestors accomplished, or what people of your race are accomplishing, doesn't mean 'regarding your race is superior to all the others' or anything. A bit like 'hometown pride' doesn't mean you have to believe every other town is garbage, or even worse in comparison.Also, 'the color of your skin' doesn't matter so much. A black albino's still got black ancestry, and Dolezal's a white girl no matter what she says. Even being of mixed race doesn't really impact this much.But while everyone is bending over themselves backwards to explain why it's okay to be proud of your (anything but white) race, let me come at this from another angle: racial pride is important when everyone around you, and the culture, is attacking your race, throwing racial epithets at you, insinuating or outright saying your life doesn't matter as much as others, blaming your race for problems, etc.You know - like people attacking white privilege, white history, white culture, and so on. Trying hard to make people feel like shit because of their race. The response of being proud of your race - openly and explicitly - can at that point be as little as 'Believing people of your race, and your race's cultures generally, have accomplished good things, and rejecting the idea that you somehow have some burden or sin due to being part of that race'. In other words, you don't have to run around screaming 'Woo! White people, we're awesome!', but having the attitude that white culture, white people, and 'whites' generally aren't honor-bound to hang their heads low and feel some kind of inane shame because of who they are? That's racial pride, and it's sensible.Short version: don't confuse racial pride with 'being a racist dick', but do be extremely suspicious of anyone insisting they can have racial pride but you shouldn't.	0.0

&gt; If a guy came to school wearing what a girl would be told is inappropriate he'd get the same treatment.If a guy walked into school wearing a v-neck and hotpants, he'd get sent to the principal's office for the same reason he would if he walked into school wearing a clown outfit and a giant red wig - they're gonna assume he's doing it for the specific purpose of being an obnoxious git. That's ignoring the fact that crossdressers exist, but that's an entirely different issue and the point stands that most schools aren't going to consider that possibility.&gt; I would also like to add I've never heard of the whole "it's distracting" reasoning until I saw feminists ranting about it on the internet.I'm going to pick at your word choice for a bit here, forgive me if it seems terribly patronizing. You use the words "feminist" and "rant" here, and that comes off as being rather inflammatory to me in context. If you replace "feminists" with "women" and "ranting" with "talking", the entire sentence changes pretty dramatically in my eyes.Onto the actual thing you said, it's a remarkably common excuse used in the bible belt and southern US where people tend to be a bit more on board with the whole "controlling women's bodies" thing.&gt; Where did you go to school, the Victorian era?The schools I went to didn't have dress codes that strict, but I absolutely know people who have and do go to school where the dress codes are ridiculous.

A lot of people would have you believe Staples is the worst place of all time to work at. The job is actually incredibly easy, even during BTS.You'll sell printers, computers, etc, and get protection plans and attachments on them. This is easy as fuck. Just tell them we offer whatever protection plan, tell them what it costs, on EVERYTHING you can attach it to. If you offer on everything, your numbers will be good, period, unless you are seriously socially awkward. The other day I sold a protection plan on a pencil sharpener. Just speak confidently. Don't forget about mice, office, antivirus, etc on a new PC. My numbers are always the best in my store and I literally just say "Hey, we offer a protection plan on this for $14.99." Memorize the prices. If you see someone waiting in line with a printer or something, open a register and take them at your register. If you have a 15% coupon or something use that to leverage a sale. Something like "I have a coupon that will make the protection plan free." Just use that if you can't get the sale without it. If you have an obvious reseller that comes in wanting a laptop with no attachments or warranty, and they want to use the $100 coupon just go into the office, play on your phone for 2 minutes, come back out and say "we're out of stock on that one." Used that trick at a grocery outlet I used to work at. "Hey, do you have more of these in the back?" Yeah sure let me check for you. Then I go back and chill in the dairy box and play on my phone.You'll take in computers that are having issues and connect them to our network to have someone else work on them remotely, then when they're done you'll verify that everything is complete (very rarely is it 100% finished, generally things that are missed are resetting internet options, removing bad addons from IE/chrome/FF, turning off unnecessary startup entries in msconfig) and then when it is complete, call and let the customer know it's done. Generally if they get virus shield I'll install Chrome and throw uBlock on there, tell them to use that, and make sure their antivirus is set up to be extremely aggressive so they don't come back in. Also some pro tips: If you can't get the computer to connect to the ET network, make sure you're not connected to a wireless network, run "netsh winsock reset" in an elevated command prompt, reset internet options, restart, then make sure the DNS on IPv4 in the LAN adapter is set to "obtain automatically". Another tip, you can start the virus removal process while the computer is waiting for an agent to connect, because sometimes it can take them several hours to connect. Just open the "ETTB_VR_WIN" folder in the ETTB and run the exe.Occasionally you may have to go to somebody's house and do an on-site tech service, usually a virus removal or a printer setup. A lot of the time in my experience the customer leaves you alone. I just start a shit ton of scans and play on my phone for an hour, and then you get paid mileage, which is pretty dope. My favorite on-site was at this older woman's house, I just started some VR scans and we just sat in her living room and I played with her dogs while we were just talking about random shit. You will have to know what you're doing though, if you're just tech sales you won't do on-sites or tech work. Stocking tech side is really easy. Normally I'll just rip the pallets apart when truck comes in, throw all the tech stuff on boats, and finish in 3 or 4 hours or so, really bust my ass doing so but then I don't have to worry about it for the rest of the week.I'd say tech is the easiest fucking job in the store. Most of the time I walk around and ask customers if they need help with anything. If you don't feel like doing anything you can generally bullshit your manager into thinking you have a lot of work to do in the tech office. Just make sure you pull down some printers and make the tech side look nice before you leave. Also please be organized. My tech supervisor is a fucking slob and it irritates me to no end. Cables lying all over the fucking place, paperwork not where it should be, nothing asset tagged, etc.The worst thing about being a tech is you're pretty much a cashier/OS associate that does tech shit, too. So whenever anybody needs help with a chair, it's you. If somebody needs help with a computer, it's you. If somebody needs to open a register and ring people out, it's you. This fucking SUCKS when you're in the middle of something.I have a full-time job but I still work at Staples part-time because it's so fucking easy and my co-workers are very cool, and my GM is great. Your mileage may vary.	0.0

What article ? You've only posted the front cover which definitely doesn't say that (and it's been a while since I've last read a Fluide Glacial but iirc there are no articles in it, only comics).   I don't know where you've seen racism or Chinese people "ruining Paris with their poor hygiene and lack of class", I think the drawing's main subject is pretty clear : Chinese investors are buying everything in Paris.    Keep in mind that it is a satirical magazine so they're most certainly mocking the mindset of people believing that the Chinese are actually taking over Paris. I don't know if you've taken a good look at the drawing but French people are definitely pictured as more dirty than the Chinese in it (red noses, poorly shaven, cigarette butts on the street, French homeless guy asking for money in Chinese etc).   Edit : and as expected : http://mobile.francetvinfo.fr/monde/chine/fluide-glacial-repond-a-la-chine-lisez-notre-magazine-vous-allez-vous-marrer_800977.html#xtref=acc_dir   Yan Lindingre (Fluide Glacial redactor in chief) :  &gt;"It's more about the stereotypes and cliches the French tend to have when it comes to the Chinese, there's no political or strategical analysis".

Are you new to gaming? Because the trend of publishers releasing broken/incomplete games is a relatively new trend. And not one we as gamers should just accept. That being said, everyone is free to make their own decisions. I tried the Madden demo and loved it, so I bought it. I haven't had any bugs that have been detrimental to my experience. But that doesn't mean we should excuse game makers (especially huge ones like EA with basically infinite manpower and money) just because "thats the way it is."	0.0

The article hits the nail on the head. Harper's beliefs aren't what matters - his policies and actions are what matters and we have 9 years of it now to evaluate him on. I mean, I don't remember much fuss about Paul Martin or Jean Chrétien being Catholic, another church which is staunchly opposed to abortion. It's almost like politicians can actually adhere to a religion without seeking to impose the beliefs of that religion on the rest of the population.A good example of this is Elizabeth May, who before entering politics had [sought to become an Anglican priest](http://www.anglicanjournal.com/articles/an-activist-an-anglican-a-political-leader). In a [speech](http://blogs.canoe.com/davidakin/main-page/elizabeth-may-and-abortion/) she gave back in the 2006 campaign, she made it clear that while she personally found abortion morally questionable, would never have one herself, and had advised other women not to abort, the Green Party's position was that abortion should remain legal. May currently claims to be "[pro-life and pro-choice](http://elizabethmaymp.ca/parliament/letters/2012/09/20/position-on-m-312/)": pro-choice in the sense that abortion should be legal, but pro-life in the sense that governments should seek to prevent abortions by preventing the conditions (e.g. poverty) which cause women to want them.BTW, the information about Harper being a member of the C&amp;MA seems to come from Lloyd Mackey's biography. [Here's the relevant section](https://books.google.ca/books?id=5v3EzVm9kPMC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=east+gate+alliance+ottawa+harper&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qytJtaCgWf&amp;sig=KH8EkaItZ8nueT1DJGrsomUBxu0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwADgUahUKEwi2r_aKx5PHAhVXFJIKHQ0xBPw#v=onepage&amp;q=east%20gate%20alliance%20ottawa%20harper&amp;f=false), which claims that, at least in his days as Opposition leader Harper had ties to East Gate Alliance in Ottawa. However, in 2010, *Vancouver Sun* religion writer, Douglas Todd, [reported](http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2010/09/09/stephen-harper-takes-calculated-risk-citing-my-christ/) (without naming his source, so it might just be hearsay) that Harper had ceased to attend that church.	0.0

How can the Githyanki trust these surface dwellers? I mean, the Githyanki are strong and proud as a race, but the rest are pathetic and weak minded. A Mindflayer would certainly take advantage of that. Therefor, any adventuring parties that aren't Githyanki are likely under the control of the Mindflayer, our enemy. They cannot be trusted. As for the encounter difficulty, by sheer weight it would be deadly. But you gotta remember that the enemy resources aren't just directed at the players, it's directed at the players with half having the potential to go elsewhere (the third opposing force). Equally, the third opposing force has this 50/50 split, so ultimately it remains at hard (assuming all three forces are fighting each other evenly). So normally where its 100% resources, it becomes 2x50% resources, which works out about evenly and keeps it in the same hard range.As for tips, I'd say roll the initiative of both Githyanki and Mindflayer forces before the session, and in a way that you can slot the player's initiative into the shebang. Have agenda's for both Githyanki and Mindflayer forces ready in your mind so the tactics they employ (and ultimately who they take hostile actions against) seems logical and not arbitrary. I **do not** recommend rolling dice to see who enemies in melee with two opposing forces attack. A Githyanki would have no reason to attack a PC if stood side by side, if they are being pressed by Mindflayer minions. Equally, a Mindflayer who's locked in combat with a PC when a Githyanki comes and attacks that PC would not be so foolish to attack the Githyanki and risk the two fighting enemies turning on him. The only way to DM the whole cocktail of situations is to run it and think logically and with some guide to the agenda's you've already figured out.Good luck, and let us know how it runs.	0.0

I seriously doubt whatever you're talking about is a similar experience, if for no other reason than we have very little idea what the experience is actually going to be like (and we won't until the game actually comes out and we get to see what kinds of levels people create with the tools the give you). So from that standpoint I can understand why someone might question buying the game at launch as opposed to waiting to see how the game and community turns out. But trying to figure out why you'd buy this as opposed to playing some "well made *flash games?" Yeah, I just don't follow. It's like saying why get Haagan-Dazs when you can get a perfectly serviceable vanilla cone for a 50 cents from that street vendor over there. There's a level of polish, quality, and feature-richness that obviously isn't going to be there in anything that's free.

I have Aspergers, which is a form of autism. Many people don't know what Aspergers is, so I tell them that it is a mild form of autism and can produce high-functioning people, like Einstein. When people hear the word autism, they automatically think down syndrome, so they are pretty shocked when they find out I have Aspergers. I want people to treat me normally, but help when I can't understand an emotion. It isn't black and white when it comes to helping handicapped people, so if I say "treat me normally and help me understand some emotions", then don't tell me "he's happy, see? He's smiling, that means happy" but also don't tell me "you are heartless, can't you see I'm sad, I've been giving you clues all day but you aren't asking me what's bothering me". Both of those are annoying, but the most annoying would be when they treat me like a 10 year old.I can cure the 10 year old mindset by saying offensive things then claiming "sorry I have Aspergers".

As far as I'm concerned YYYp is peasantry too. It came from TVs, and robbed us of our 16:10 resolutions and the precious pixels at the bottom of our screens. Gone went 1920x1200, here comes 1920x1080 your new king! But wait, is this not a downgrade? But as was our way during those dark times, we magnanimously ignored the insult and said "Very well, we of the master race will tolerate this". For our games were configurable, and would happily play on whatever resolution we asked them to, it was no trouble to tell them to play on a different resolution. But still, these names carry with them the stink of the console peasants, and I cannot abide that any longer.And don't even get me started on those terrible antiquated messes of letters like WQXGA+ and WUSXGA and probably next will be SUWMQTHXGA++* (super-ultra-wide-mega-quad-turbo-hyper-XGA-plus-plus-star).

Yeah, jeans are tough because so many of them are badly whiskered (which doesn't look flattering on ANYONE, WHY is this still a thing?!) so even if you find a good fit they will likely not be ideal.  I definitely think you can rock a skinny jean, although you'll also look good in other styles.  For skinnies, look for solid colors or very subtle fading, and go for dark blue or black (I think black would look great in outfit 1).  And as mentioned elsewhere, do proper jeans, not jeggings.  They can still have a good amount of stretch but they should feel substantial between your fingers.My impressions on the outfits: 1 looks nice, I would be interested to see it with a nude-to-you undershirt/bra instead of black.  Or, looking again, a black cami that prevents us from seeing the waistband of your jeans against your skin - i.e. makes an unbroken line under the shirt.  Keep the hem of the shirt ironed if possible, it will wrinkle throughout the day but what can you do.2 I think has a cute shape on you.  Definitely a nude bra here.  I guess you might be going for the visible bra trend so I should qualify that I don't personally like that trend ;)3 If you want to try turtlenecks, you might look for one that covers your whole neck instead of cutting it in half.  Turtlenecks can be flattering when they create a long neck and a clean, long torso.  I'm also tempted to say it would look better without a cardigan but I'm not much for turtlenecks.  For that cardigan, which I like on you, I think pair it with shirts that match the length (at the shortest part of the hem, not sticking out below) or are tucked into a high-waisted bottom, to make it more intentional (again that may be totally wrong, but maybe worth a try).4 Shirt looks alright, sleeves are too long which is more noticeable with the pattern.  I liked the idea someone else had of tucking it into a high-waisted something, I think where it ends at your crotch/widest part of your hips isn't idea.5 I like this sweater on you, and I like the little cuffed sleeve.  I think it's always going to have a casual vibe so I don't know that I'd try to style it up too much.  Just pair it with black bottoms, put your hair in a messy bun, and call it a day!6 I like this sweater less, although the color and neckline are nice.  The overall shape is so sack-like that it is making you look larger through the middle, which you are clearly not from your other photos.  The grey sweater also floats away from your middle, but in a structured way that looks more intentional I guess.  I think this burgundy sweater could look really nice tucked into something that hits at your waist, and tugged out a tiny bit to create that extra contrast between your waist and the width of the shirt.  A black pencil skirt could give a cool contrast between casual and crisp.  It may be tricky to do that with the sweater being so long, I dunno.Finally I think all of these could benefit from some cute jewelry or other accessories (outfits 1 and 5 kept very minimalist and clean, maybe a gold bangle or something), and styling of your hair, which maybe you do anyway.  The fitbit is fine but try not to wear hair ties on your wrist, it has a surprisingly large impact on the outfit since we talk with our hands and I think are trained to notice each other's hands.Anyway, take all that with a giant grain of salt because my body type is very different - very bottom-heavy, you are much more proportionate! - and I have a hard enough time dressing myself ;)	0.0

I'm sorry, but where exactly did you get that from? The faster you're going, presumably the lower the angle will be. And if you take a look at the Mavic article you see that in the testing they did in Kona they saw a much higher incidence of &gt;10º angles.While I also agree with the author's conclusion, you do have to pick your equipment based on your conditions. The conclusions in the Mavic tests included swapping wheels and testing, and they saw some pretty significantly different performance (20W!) between some of the different wheels with the wind at higher angles. Obviously this is going to be different depending on where you're riding and even day-to-day conditions.	0.0

"Oh, no, my king. I was simply pausing for dramatic effect. An interval in the story, if you will, in case you had questions or comments, or if you wished to dismiss me out of hand. If you thought that was interesting, well... you've heard nothing, yet."Raising her hands, she continued. "Ursula Upcliff fought the Andals at the Battle of Seven Stars, with the other First Men houses of the Vale. She was a sorceress of great power. Six times, the Andal forces led their men in the charge, and six times they were repelled, in no small part due to Ursula. And then, when the seventh attack came, she rode forth on her red horse, dripping blood, to kill the Andal king once and for all.""But it was late in the day and she was spent; even her power had limits. An Andal warrior tore her head from her shoulders and thus was the battle lost. The Andals settled the Vale, and so came the times we know today.""But if not for Lady Upcliff, the battle of Seven Stars would have been over in an hour or less. Without her... abilities... the Andal triumph would have been complete.""However, you would be wrong to dismiss Lady Ursula's death as weakness. Why do you think the Arryns needed to win Witch Isle by marriage? It was many, many years before we knelt to them; one humble, tiny island off the coast of the Vale, with barely five hundred fighting men... it should have been an easy conquest, but it was not. This was because of my family."She leaned closer to Baelor still. "There is a word, my king, a word that nobody says. One that the common people have come to fear." With every word she got a little closer, so that she could whisper it to him. "_Magic_," she hissed, and her smile was wide enough to sail a ship through.And then, with a sudden movement, she leaned back into her chair. "After Lady Ursula's death, my family has had a rule. Our most absolute law, if you will... we do not interfere. This is why, while we have maintained our loyalty to the Arryns and the realm, we personally have never rode to war.""But now, as the Maimed Prince lies dead and the snow has settled upon the ground, the Lady of Upcliff has come beforethe Boy King about to be a man... and all that remains to be seen is whether he will offer her a place at his court or on his council. I have been granted sight of the future, and this is the path that I know I must take. Even if it means..." she gave a burst of clear laughter. "Bending the rules, somewhat."	0.0

I'm a 20-30 something and I have to  say I really like open planned work places with some exceptions:1) You need to have enough meeting rooms and private areas that you can go discuss something in private almost at any time if needed. If I decide I need to talk to my boss about something personal that isn't right now urgent, I need to know that at some point today I will have some private area to discuss stuff.2) You need to have a culture that promotes socialising with staff, and "break out" areas etc that encourage staff to get to know each other. This means you need to have good kitchen facilities, free tea and coffee etc.3) Senior staff need to join in. In my old company everyone was open planned but then some senior staff and some teams had access to rooms or offices no-one else did. This just causes resentment. However if the CFO didn't have a huge corner office and instead sat in the office and the canteen with everyone else, he seems a lot more personable even if you don't talk to him.4) Give everyone a set of privacy screens. You can stick it on your PC screen so you can only see it if you're sitting in front of it. This means that you don't have people concerned about who is looking at what they are doing as much, and focuses on the other benefits of open planned offices.The last bit of the article sort of annoys me too as the author is basically asking "If I have headphones in it means don't disturb me". I've never once in the office ever gone up to something and just dumped something on them (despite working in a job where I often ask people to produce stuff for me despite not being their boss).The whole POINT is that you're never "inaccessible" but what you can say is "I'm just in the middle of something that really needs my attention right now, is it OK if I talk to you about it tomorrow?". The alternative is I send you an e-mail which you either take the same amount of time replying to, or you ignore it and then I don't know what I'm doing with my time either.I get that not everyone likes open planned offices, especially when they are done badly, but done well it does work and it's loads better then cubicles. I mean I'm at the stage now where even if you're in an open plan office all sitting at a big long set of tables, if there are dividers between the tables I think it's a bit claustrophobic.	0.0

I dont understand why our people and most importantly politicians (esp till the 70s) think the IA is a crackpot army like Al baki army. No it isnt. In fact successive govts have screwed the  officials of the army (on the fears of a coup) so badly that it's resulted in just downright terrible  treatment of army officers, to a loss in the war.. Please read about V.K Krishnan and how he treated army guys, how the purposely broke up chains of commands, caused confusion....so that there would be no unity to lead to a coup. Gen. K.S. Thimayya was made to resign, Even someone like Sam Maneckshaw was treated shabbily, had him investigated for anti-national activities....It finally took 1962 to actually undo some of this nonsense done by him. But later was again questioned by IndiraG about him planning a coup.Paranoia about your own armed forces/people and thinking they are about to get, you or have the worst planned for people despite them not demonstrating it for the last 70 odd years,  is just downright unhealthy. In fact if you talk to many army people they actually hate it that people think the army can get to those levels. If the army of a country wants to take over it will do so, it is the most powerful org in most countries  But our army isnt like that, it really is not interested in this stuff,  stop assuming so. this sort of fear mongering has already cost us a war. some amount of trust is required to make things work.Indira Gandhi asked him: “So when are you going to take over the country, Sam? He replied: “You run the country, I run the army.”	0.0

It's a pretty simple thing to say for someone that grew up with parents who cared about such things, and kept such documentation on hand.  Many people in poor communities barely even know their parents, much less what happened to their birth certificate in the last 16 years.  Have you ever actually tried to start with no valid form of ID and obtain a replacement birth certificate?    I understand the sentiment, but the fact of the matter is that it's substantially more likely that someone from a stable household is going to have an easier time of this, while someone from an impoverished background is going to find it burdensome.

I worked at a place with a totally separate restaurant. The food sucked. So I would just adjust it off their bill, and in the end the restaurant would have to pay us for the guest's meal. We had two separate codes- one for taking it off for hotel guest satisfaction (Oh your room sucked? Here, let me adjust off your lunch) and one for direct restaurant complaints. Anything deeper than that was "We don't own the restaurant, but I will gladly introduce you to the manager on duty over there." The guests didn't take that as an answer either-- but if it was a complaint that comping on our end didn't solve it seriously had to go the restaurant GM.	0.0

&gt;Speaking of Fort McMurray - what the hell guys? Capacity is 15,000, CFLDB says that there were 11,000+ in the stands for a preseason game against the Riders. Evidently they outnumbered the Eskimo fans that day. The CFL should never go here for a game again, if you ask me.This is because the Esks pre-season game was known about long in advance and tickets were being sold for the entire offseason.  The regular season game was announced just prior to the season after most of the tickets to the preseason game were already sold.  So I think most people had already committed to go to the preseason game and then couldn't do both.  That being said I would have thought there would be more interest from locals in supporting a once in a lifetime type event for the city.	0.0

They'll never admit that they fucked up the identity and are remaking it.But even if they do try to salvage it in some way, we STILL won't be satisfied because the fact is, a lot of answers are NEVER going to be answered or make sense when they are.

I'm not excusing what I did . Robjm asked why someone would do this and what their thought processes were that would let them do this so I tried to answer as honestly as I think I can. The simple truth is that as a depressed person with an eating disorder, I wasn't thinking much outside my own sphere of misery and yes, that kind of thinking is selfish and destructive. Is that acceptable? Absolutely not. . As it was over 20 yrs ago and I have never done anything like it before or since,I've tried to understand why I did that so I don't allow myself to get into a mindset that DOES excuse that kind of behaviour. Living on about $50 a fortnight after rent and bills were paid didn't help, nor did living on about 300 calories on many days of the week help either. Basically  a brain starved of food and affection can make stupid, selfish choices. But  it is a part of my life and I'm not proud of it. But I was never a serial offender, and I did replace the cake and make amends. If  you're perfect and have never done stupid shit in your life, good for you. Some of us are more fallible human beings.	0.0

Well he certainly has an advantage on you - that sort of goes without saying.The first thing you do in getting boundaries is refuse to communicate with him UNLESS it is ALL done in writing.  You can use email, text, letter - whatever.  When you casually talk with once another and *don't document it* he can change it to whatever the fuck he wants, even accusing you of saying something - or never saying something.  Also, never fall trap into going toe to toe with him in the snark department, *especially* in writing.  Always keep the words down and to the point.He's got a point about where *the kids* should live.  Of course moving back in with him is a ridiculous option.  But, It is not in your kids' best interest to "move in" with another guy, unless you are married.  Overall though, this should not mean that you should be stuck in your mother's home?!  Do not let them bully you into one of these two options.  You have every right to move to an apartment with suitable bedrooms for your kids, within a reasonable driving distance that you an your X agree on.It is WAY too soon to move you and your kids in with a guy you've only been seeing 8 months.

You're thinking of it wrong. The Midichlorians *are* the wand, or they *are* the Thuum (I think, was the Thuum the language or the actual act of shouting? I think it was the language). Both of those are ways of using magic, they are not the magic itself. Destroying Harry Potter's wand doesn't take away from the magic in the Wizarding World, and erasing the Draconic Language doesn't lessen the magic of Nirn.Likewise the Midichlorians don't create the Force, and destroying them doesn't lessen the Force (at least, no more than destroying any life in the Star Wars universe does), they are just the tool the Jedi use to be able to manipulate the Force.	0.0

&gt;Many conceptions of god can't refer to something that exists, because the way he is defined makes his existence logically impossible. For example, theists say god is timeless and unchanging and the cause of the universe, yet the universe has a beginning and does not always exist. But for the universe to not always exist means that the timeless and unchanging god must have not created the universe at one moment, and then at another moment created it. In which case, god would have to be temporal and changing after all – not creating one moment but then creating the next moment.This seems to be a reply of a partial strong atheist. This argument does not refute exhaustively all gods. With this you cannot claim that all gods are refuted.&gt;All available historical evidence proves that gods are purely human inventions. Humans made up 5,000 gods in recorded history and we know them all to be completely imaginary and man-made with the same confidence as we know the Flying Spaghetti Monster is just made up.This argument is full of fallacies, including bulverism, circular logic, and informal fallacy.We can go in the relevant details. But just one point: Even if ALL of those who originated those concepts were lunatics and hypocrites, what kind of proof it would be against God?&gt;Neuroscience, psychology and psychology of religion are close to providing a complete explanation for why humans believe in religion or gods. Belief in the existence of gods has no foundation in reality, but is based on irrational thinking and psychological biases like pareidolia and false agent detection, also called hyperactive agency detection.This is not but bulverism and circular reasoning. You think in the opposite direction. You take your conclusion about the non-existence of God, and use it as the cause of your argument.This is also clearly an informal fallacy.&gt;There is excellent evidence and arguments for metaphysical naturalism, which are so convincing that the vast majority of professional philosophers are naturalists. Naturalism means the natural world is everything that exists; no gods, ghosts, vampires or other shenanigans.I looked at your link. But there is no explanation, but links to other pages. Please say what is noteworthy for you in your own words, so that we can keep debating on this point.However, if "Naturalism means the natural world is everything that exists" is your main point, this is not an argument for non-existence of God, but rather a rephrasing that there is no God. But if you can assert with non-circular arguments that your statement is correct, then we can discuss. At this point, for me your statement is just an unsubstantiated conclusion with no value in the context of OP.&gt;A) god is indiscernible from something that doesn't exist. B) Indiscernibles are identical. Conclusion: god doesn't exist.Here also conclusion about the non-existence of God is hidden in your argument, and the basis of your argument. So again circular logic. Your statement assumes that God does not exist, therefore the universe is not the creation of God, therefore, God is indiscernible from something that doesn't exist, (=&gt;Therefore God does not exist).Accordingly, at this stage, none of your arguments have any value as arguments of a non-partial strong atheist.	0.0

I wanted to look behind the numbers on this:* There's two bars - the visitor's bar and the member's bar. They're both counted as a single bar for the purposes of FOI requests and tallying revenue raised. The visitor's bar is open to anyone within the Leinster House complex, whilst the member's bar is for TDs and Senators only. * Assuming a pint of Guinness is still [4.30](http://www.thejournal.ie/dail-bar-guinness-cheaper-than-buswells-or-shelbourne-1071316-Sep2013/), and lager is 4.70, we can get a total price for 301 pints of Guinness and 139 pints of lager as just under 1947.60. Finally, let's assume that 139 spirits were bought, equivalent to the amount of lager. That adds another 570 or so to the total. So we're left with an estimated grand expenditure on drink at around 2600 euros, out of the 7500 or so spent in total. So we've an estimated 4900 or so left over. * So what else is the Dáíl bar used for? Food. The bar doubles as a cafe, and primarily fulfils this function (rather than being a bar) during business hours. I suspect that the far greater remainder was spent on this, rather than on TDs being out on the piss. * So considering this, and the far higher number of visitors and other staff on hand that day, it is understandable why the bar raised that much revenue.	0.0

Who said anything about not studying climate?  I certainly didn't.I think studying *anything* is interesting/important and may be of value in many ways.

I don't doubt there has been a degree of change in the membership, but I don't think that it's the major factor.In my opinion the major factor has been that the Tories have so successfully pushed the narrative that the recession was caused by labour overspending, and that the only 'cure' is austerity.  Labour under Ed accepted too much of this narrative and it created the impression that labour mismanaged the economy.  Rather than try and counter that, the 3 mainstream candidates decided its too late, accepted it and moves on.  A lot of labours base see this as a betrayal and a shift to the right, exemplified by labour not opposing the welfare bill.  Part of Corbyn appeal is that he is resisting this lurch to the right.Many of us on the left were willing to accept leaders like Blair (or potentially David Miliband), because they were able to resist the more extreme right wing policies.  If the centre of the party aren't wiling to take this on, why should I support them?  (I realize that Andy is now starting to claw back into that role).Tldr: Problem was Ed not controlling the message, causing a lurch to the right by the leadership, causing the Corbyn backlash.	0.0
&gt; Have you noticed, Stil, how beautiful the young women are this year?Leto says this to shock Stilgar into the awareness that water-richness is softening the people and causing the Fremen to abandon their heritage. He says it to trigger Stilgar's rebellion against Alia, which he (Leto) needs to begin the process of removing her. He says it ironically. See *Children of Dune* pg 93-96.None of which changes the fact that this is a very beautiful painting.	0.0

This is probably one of the few  times I wouldn't use this account or pull up one of my alts to bet gold it won't. Because australia day, therefore a bunch of australia-focused content - lists of deadly animals are likely, and no matter how they ended up with the idea or what animals are on the list, you'd be demanding gold. Not worth it.Though, really, if you think buzzfeed does nothing but steal reddit content, you vastly overestimate the quality of reddit content. Edit - also(and for example) on my phone and I've not expanded the comments yet, but I will bet you dollars to doughnuts that there's a bunch of people making jokes buzzfeed headlines, while fucking it up and using the wrong headline style, because it's just bandwagon opinion karma whoring anyway.Bit like a kid I remember from school, who thought chewing up old ink cartridges for twenty cents will make him popular, because people laugh when he does it.Second edit - getting toward the evening on Australia day and no content about cute deadly animals. Maybe I should have bet gold, so that I could be 12 for 12, instead of merely 11 for 11. One day, I'll have to pay that five bucks and stupid conspiracy theories about incredibly mundane shit that doesn't fucking matter will chalk up one on the board, but it doesn't look like today is that day.Third - And then, hilariously, stolen content from Buzzfeed makes the front page.

Example, hating James Harden in 2013 and loving him in 2014 and this year. the overreaction to bad defense. there was a thread here a while ago asking if Tony Allen was better than Damian Lillard (not even a bad defender). you guys think good defense is EVERYTHING. Mike Conley? most overrated PG in basketball. guys like Kyrie Irving are what I call "overrated-underrated". he's so known as an "overrated" player here that he's become underrated. kneejerk threads.

* An open-ended customization single player/co-op campaign - Pick a map, pick some countries to spawn there, and pick a few dozen stacks of reinforcements to pull in later then get started. Maybe have the game create more reinforcement stacks if the game starts to drag on or a time/loss limit to prevent stalemates.* More maps - And not just old maps with new zones or rotations. Map maker support would also be nice if the engine ever gets upgraded from the hot mess it's described as now.* Easier to understand nation trees - Maybe have a list of all units with what nationality/specialization/year/and such is needed to pick.* Better unit search features - There are hundreds of units. How hard would it be to filter every tank with greater than 15 front armour, costs less than 100 points, has more than 4 units per card, main cannon range longer than 2000m, etc....* Better naval aspects - Get rid of all ocean ships and focus on amphibious/coastal vessels. Make the naval aspect a part of coastal ground maps instead of locking the feature away in a separate and barely playable mode.* More Air drops - Drop supplies directly onto the battlefield around a beleaguered position. Drop recon Humvee's and SEAL teams behind enemy lines and hope they can get grounded before they get slaughtered. More options to spawn units and supplies would open up new strategies and since the drops could be defeated by AA and balanced by higher cost/lower availability it wouldn't replace old styles.* Better infantry mechanics - Even if it was just an option to let SF infantry alternate between moving slow and unseen or charging in 'shock and awe' style there needs to be some way to keep infantry better hidden at times. A way to set infantry to 'only fire if fired upon' would be great.* Visibility cones - Nothing that tells you exactly what the unit can see when you move them, that would make the game a lot easier and that's not the intention, but some indication of what the game means by optics level and a units field of view would be nice.* More player-built structures - The option to have engineer units build bridges using supplies would be an instant game changer.* More destruction - Blow up roads and have them gone for the rest of the game. Same with bridges, buildings, trees, etc... After being napalmed and hit with 1000kg bombs a treeline won't be offering shelter anymore. Same with buildings that should be nothing but rubble after a few hundred MLRS rockets rain down.* Civilians - Think about it. Civilian convoys fleeing the fight that you get penalized for killing. Is your recon good enough to distinguish between a T-72 and a Fiat Uno?* Multi-loadout planes - Buy an F/A-18 and select loadouts per sortie between pure fighter superiority, AIM missiles, JDAM's, rockets, etc... and add a cost every time the plane is launched to balance the new options.	0.0

The point is that most people respect that people in the service industry are humans too.  Walking in 5 minutes before close turns their shift from 7-8 hours into an additional hour or however long it takes for the food, plus to eat. If it is a small burger or something, then whatever.  But I work at a place known for deep dish pizza.  It takes 45 minutes to cook one.  If you walk into our restaurant 5 minutes before close and ask for one, you are not wrong.  You are just an asshole.  It takes minimal planning to avoid this (ie do not walk into a restaurant 5 fucking minutes before close; what are you thinking?).  Or just get it to-go and no server will be stuck waiting on your table when they could either be getting rest for their next shift, or be doing something more productive with their life than waiting on your late, and dumb, ass.	0.0

&gt;It's basically full auto at that point.this is my point. it already stops becoming a burst weapon and becomes an automatic weapon with firing rate equal to/greater than the static burst rate. i'm not saying my idea wouldn't completely change how they work, i'm saying it would make them always be burst weapons instead of sometimes automatics, sometimes burst guns. as is, if you put fire rate in them, the best you can hope for is a failed automatic weapon. my idea would make it so the bursts are tighter while there is still a delay between the bursts (when using fire rate mods) instead of the current "put fire rate in gun to make it equivalent to an automatic." if you spammed fire rate into one on my idea it would throw bullets out exasperatingly fast, sure, but it would still obviously be a burst weapon.&gt;and you will probably see how too powerful it might get.and why should burst weapons be forbidden to be excellent weapons? sure, the hind will probably always suck but that doesn't mean they all should be forced to be. i for one want to actually like the paracyst but how burst weapons work it's alt-fire-only or bust with it.	0.0

I don't think there is anything in the canon that states how many people are in Asia in the 23-24th century and there have been at least 2 large global conflicts before that which could explain differences in the population.

Exactly. For example, a lot of people noticed that Zoe (and Queenie, I think?) performed all of the Seven Wonders throughout the series, yet she wasn't the Supreme. It was hinted at that Cordelia's suppressing of her powers somehow channeled them into the other girls, which is why Queenie could perform Vitalum Vitalis on Misty when she was alone with Cordelia, but failed to perform it later. However I think a lot of people missed that, which some would see as a massive plot hole.	0.0

Exactly! I worked at Petsmart about 14 years ago and this is one of the most frequent conversations I had. I would tell people you'd need at least 2 gallons per inch of gold fish and that they produce a lot of ammonia so either get a filter or clean the bowl several times a week. Id always get the whole "but I got them at carnivals when I was a kid and we just put it in a bowl", to which I'd have to reply " yeah and how long did it live? Usually a couple of weeks was the best response. I don't know where this whole trend of putting them in tiny bowls started, but yes, it's the absolute worse place for that type of fish. I too would always suggest beta fish as an alternative.

[Request] I can't remember how a certain joke goes. Does anybody know it? The joke is about a young boy on his birthday asking his parents if they both know what age he is. They both correctly guess so he then goes to his grandpa who says he can always tell by touching his penis. The joke then goes very graphic as it describes the grandpas crusted hands touching and feeling at the child until he eventually says the right age. At which point he tells the boy that he heard the mother say his age earlier.	1.0

I want to enjoy reading about blackberry not hearing stupid shit about other platforms that isn't true. It's just bitter and cynical. Get over it. Blackberry isn't surviving and the market spoke. Edit: which you think most people here would understand, because they claim to be "people who use their phones for work, email and productivity in professional industries that demand privacy".

So, the AskMen collective despises meeting women with children, but if you're already dating a woman with a child it's A-OK?

Some will be forwarded 6 months, some for a year.Also, just because you pay a late payment or a charged off account, that does not mean your score will improve!  That negative mark will stay on your report for seven years.  If you did not get a pay for delete agreement in writing, then you can try a Goodwill Letter.Other than a Goodwill Letter, you are out of options.  Legally, they are required to report accurate information.  By agreeing to a Goodwill Letter, they are violating their agreements with the credit bureaus.  It is sort of like a gentleman's code about just ignoring that rule.  Some companies will do it, some won't.	0.0
It is one-sided because it's based on the book. The story is from Chris Kyle himself. It's all done about his experiences, and how he portrayed. It's not meant to be an open for interpretation kind of thing, it's based off of what the guy actually did, and how he felt during his time in Iraq. How is he made out to be Prince Charming? The movie constantly displays his faults and imperfections.	0.0

Thank you for the comments. i would like to begin by sharing some insight on poison. Most people believe that sickness is a bad thing. Getting a cold is not a pleasant journey and thus should be avoided. This is not a good idea. Poisons or sickness challenge the body. They create scenarios for the body to explore its bitter nature. Increase its immune system, as well expel other toxins from the body. The culture I am trying to share with you is one that deals with Inorganic foods, spends most of its time indoors on computers with poor posture, and knows very little basics about possible ways to use the body. Kung fu means time and energy. Gung fu means Chinese boxing aka their culture and artistic expression x amount of years ago and even today. How do you know you are not drinking poison today? Your A to B archetypical set up is a very poor mistake. Kung fu can be learned from baking dough, folding paper, or gymnastics. Your like a Walmart shopper asking where to find lightbulbs. A warrior does not simply study the sword! They study flower arrangement, caligrophy, and fishing if they want to eat well.  As for your statement on enlightent. Why not the Egyptians, Roma, herbrews, most people are Muslim, suffies are supposed to be pretty smart their word for love and gravity are the same. I teach the culture of the earth not of China or Indonesia.	0.0

I'm going to piggy back on this topic with a question of my own, if I may. Is OCI basically only for jobs at bigger (or at least medium) firms? Everyone at my school seems to assume we're all gunning for BigLaw, so I'm unsure if the constant pressure they put on us about having fantastic grades for OCI is for that purpose only, or if it's for non-firm jobs as well.	0.0

&gt;  The current league leader in damage share for the ADC role is 29.7% from H2K’s Hjarnan. Often placed on Sivir or Corki, he is able to acquire this damage share with high AOE champions.What? Sivir is 10th in damage for plat+, I do not know how she fares in competitive, but yea...Draven is 5th. Not to mention that Freeze has 4th least damage dealt of all the ADCs in Europe; dealing 150 damage less than Hjärnan per minute (437 and 586 respectively). 50 less than MrRallez, with higher gold differential, and 2 less than Tabzz with a 300 gold differential.Not just that, but the often claimed bad or mediocre CandyPanda deals 65 damage more than Freeze per minute, and has only got 2 more wins.Overall Freeze is not some sort of God stuck in a bad team. When I reviewed CW's playstyle prior to the exodus, my conclusion was that Airwaks was the player who was keeping the team in the game, making up for mistakes by the other players by engaging at the right times, or sacrificing in such a way to save more than was lost. Yes, Freeze and Soren were outputing damage, but not nearly enough to over-shadow the play-making of Airwaks (who was overshadowed by the failures of the rest of the team). No, Airwaks was not a great mechanical player, not the best playmaker, but without a doubt (IMO) the best player on the team.	0.0

The only difference between this guy and HDHR is rank and the fact that IvalteK is a 'softcore' cheater. HDHR asked for $1,000 on the premise that he'll stream in the future. This guy wanted money for shipping so he could get his first mechanical keyboard.To the people in this thread, what the fuck kind of hypocrites are you? I'm not defending cheating, and I don't personally know/care about the IvalteK player, but I'm against this extremist attitude. It's indisputable that he should be banned, but forcing refunds/calling Paypal. Seriously, what the fuck.	0.0
There's a key difference in your scenarios -- whether the subject of a relationship has been brought up or not.  To make the scenarios truly comparable they'd have to look something like this:* A FWB situation where the woman wants a relationship, the man has told her no, and she chooses to remain FWB.  * A friend zone situation where the man wants a relationship, the woman has told him no, and he chooses to remain friends.  In these more equivalent scenarios, do you see a major difference?In any event, I'd still say the guy in your friend zone scenario is not a victim -- he has the ability to ask for a relationship or leave and has chosen to do neither.  He would only be a victim if the woman continuously dangles the *hope* of a relationship in front of him in order to maintain his presence.  Similarly, a man who continuously dangles the hope of a LTR in front of a FWB would be victimizing her.  Victimization almost always requires some form of deception or dishonesty.	0.0

What's hard to understand? They don't desire sex. That's not that hard to understand. I have no sex drive because of medications, but even before they killed my sex drive, I didn't really want sex. It just wasn't important to me. I'd rather have non-sexual physical contact and emotional intimacy. I had to break off my last relationship because they were really horny and I didn't feel comfortable.Sex seems like a great thing, but I just don't want it. Simple, not that hard to understand.	0.0

&gt; And no you missed the point a lot of men when speaking on "Women have it awesome in XYZ subject..." are probably not considering "everyone else." So now it's not most men, but a lot of men, and only probably. That seems a bit more reasonable. So as to enlightening you of my problem? I don't like generalisations of men. There's been enough of this shit in the female centric subs where generalisations take place, and men get shit on for daring to say that not all men do it. Here, I thought maybe that wouldn't happen as much, and when it did you could be called out on it.EDIT: Forgot to include this delightful phrase "In general I think most guys"	0.0
