Gandhi,"Gandhi never wore shoes, so his feet were very rough. He also ate very little, which made him very skinny and weak. He was a devout Hindu, which led him to being seen by many of his followers as a religious leader as well as a political reformer. The few things he ate were usually quite pungent, leading to him having bad breath. Finally, he was also a huge fan of Mary Poppins. You could say he was a super-calloused-fragile-mystic-hexed-by-halitosis.",17,puns.csv

I never really had any friends or anything, and I pretty much was just waiting for when I turned 18 so I could leave. One day, one of the usual suspects comes in, but he is alone. He is a really rich dude, looking to do the weird homeschool thing in the cool mansion. I still remember the stiff cot under me when he came in. ""Hey,"" he said   ""hi,"" I said. he left immediately, and then came back later. that's all he needed, and I was adopted immediately. I was so happy. we got into his nice Mercedes, and drove off. We stopped at a nearby restaurant, which was the first meal I had had outside the orphanage in years.   ""you hungry?"" he says with his dark shades on""OMG yes I'm starving"" I reply he takes off his shades to reveal a tear in his eye""Hi starving, I'm dad""",9,puns.csv

(she loves math, music, cotton candies, and Nicki Minaj). It would be the best if you guys can write that pun down and take a picture of it, and comment below, or simply just write it down in the comment section. I will collect all answers and make her a pun collection related to her, just because she makes fun of us pun people all the time. Thank you very much if you could help. God bless.",2,puns.csv

"February 29th, 2020","On February 29th of this year, something extraordinary happened. I was walking across the road, head down, minding my own - when I heard it. This incessant, mechanical noise. Like spring-loaded footsteps. Real slow. Far away, it came. Cascading against the city walls. A pneumatic sigh. I turned to look - and that's when I saw him. He wore a tuxedo, the classic black/white combo. Red crash helmet. Big black specs, like novelty size. And he was inexplicably pogoing. Pogoing towards me. Each vertical lunge felt like a lifetime. As he made his angled ascent, his glasses were knocked off-centre, and as pogo hit pavement, he'd right them again. This was his ritual. Why had he singled me out? Why was no one else reacting? What did he want? Finally he arrived, landing inches from my face. His forehead shone with sweat as he smiled a broken smile. He nodded softly and I nodded back, as if we were expecting one another. As if this had been ordained. He reached into the interior pocket of his blazer, rummaging around before producing a thick wad of lined paper. He stared me dead in the eye as he began to rip the first sheet in one deliberate motion. When it was finished, he began with the next - and so it went on. I was transfixed. Each rip was penetrating, each tear transcendental. It were as if the sound were emanating from deep inside. As if the tectonic plates of reality were fracturing around us. Perhaps this is the sound that will greet me at heaven's gate, I thought. And then he was off. Launching skyward with great force as he continued to tear. Leap, tear. Leap, tear, til he was out of view. I was alone again. My mind racing. My day displaced. Why did he jump so? That blood-red point imprinting the blue beyond. And why did he tear? Each parted sheet lying in a scattered trail, fleecing the concrete like snow.Something welled within, something beyond imagining. And on that day, on that absurd day, on February 29th 2020, I cried a single tear. It was a leap tear.",58,AntiAntiJokes.csv
A horse walks into the transfinite continuum,"and sees a bar up ahead. The horse walks into the bar and sees a shadow serving drinks.""Ah, look who came crawling back! Potuous, my man, how's it been?""Potuous, the horse, slides his credit card across the counter and grunts.""Heard you got a job at manufacturing,"" says the shadow as it fills a glass of scotch. ""How's that working out for you?""Potuous neighs.""Nay? Alright, I get it. Not every gig's a walk in the park."" The shadow pushes the glass over, and Potuous sinks his muzzle into it, splashing and gulping away. ""I'm sure it's not all bad, though. I mean, you didn't end up here by choice. I, I assume.""The glass falls off the counter and shatters, but the noise dissipates between the notes of the music box in the corner.""Who the hell are you?"" Potuous groans.The shadow chuckles. ""C'mon, Potuous, it's me! Oh, come now, don't tell me you don't remember who I am. We were best pals in highschool! Freshman year? Matching yearbook photos? We, uh, we wrote a book together! Well, it was mostly you, heh, I just gave you the idea.""Potuous tilts his long face at him. ""…Right. Corvid, was it?""""Damn right. I knew you'd remember me."" Corvid takes out another glass and fills it up. ""So how *did* you end up here?""""I'm moving. Just stopped by for a drink.""""Moving? Where to?""""Onwards.""""Ah."" Corvid quickly pours himself a shot glass. ""I'll cheers to that.""Potuous doesn't drink. He watches as Corvid clinks the glasses and downs his hastily-crafted cocktail. A shadow can't ingest liquids; it spills all over the floor, but Corvid covers up his shame with a smile. ""Heh. Still not used to it."" He grabs a towel and crouches below the counter, still within earshot of Potuous's heavy sigh. The horse taps his hooves absent-mindedly, appearing to be happier in a different place.And so the two of them spend the next few minutes in silence, making sure to avoid eye contact but not knowing why. At least, Corvid doesn't know.""Well,"" the shadow finally says, ""it's funny you should come round here now, since—""""I really don't enjoy your presence.""""…oh.""""Look, just give me the tab. I've got things to do.""""Yes. Right."" He pulls out a paper slip and quickly jots down the bill. ""Well, it was nice seeing you again.""Potuous takes his credit card and leaves quietly, returning to the transfinite continuum. Corvid wishes to say something to his friend, but doesn't know what to say. They part ways in silence.He sighs and goes back to mopping the floor. A lizard woman walks up to him, tilting her head as if in pity. ""Why the long face?""""I… I don't know. I feel like I've changed. For the worse. I feel as if there was something in me that I liked about myself, and that I've lost it. I don't know.""""Honey, don't let that quadruped SOB get on your nerves.

"Twenty Jokes That'll Make You Go ""Karblowza!""","#\#1 ""I Am""Mrs. Smith walks into a classroom of first-graders. ""Good morning, class!"" she says. ""Today we will learn the letter 'I'. Who can give me a sentence with an 'I' in it?""Little Timmy raises his hand.""Yes, Timmy?""""I is—""""No, Timmy,"" Mrs. Smith interrupts, ""after the word 'I' you should say the word 'am,' not the word 'is.'""""Okay,"" Timmy says, ""I am the 9th letter of the alphabet.""#\#2 ""Three Pairs of Apples""Mr. Presley writes on the chalkboard ""2+2+2="" and turns to his class. ""Children,"" he calls, ""if I give you 2 apples, and another 2 apples, and yet another 2 apples, how many apples would you have?""Little Timmy raises his hand.""Yes, Timmy?""""7 apples, sir.""""No, no, listen carefully: I gave you 2 apples, and then I gave you 2 more, and then 2 more again. How many apples do you have now?""""7.""""Okay, look, if I gave you 2 oranges, you would have 2, right? If I gave you 2 more oranges, you would have 4. Then, if I gave you 2 more oranges, how many oranges would you have now?""""6.""""Correct! So if I gave you 2 apples, and then 2 more apples, and finally 2 more apples again, how many apples would you have?""""7 apples.""""Timmy, for fuck's sake, where did you get another apple?""""My mom gave me one for lunch.""#\#3 ""I Know the Whole Truth""Little Timmy sits down in the lunchroom. He eats his apple and drinks his orange juice, but he is still hungry. So he heads to the cafeteria, grabs a tray and begins loading it up with goodies. At the end of the line, the cashier asks him if he's got money on him. Timmy shakes his head, and the cashier takes the tray from him and moves it to the back. ""Sorry, kid,"" he says. ""You gotta pay for the cafeteria.""Timmy walks away sadly. A nearby pupil notices him and taps him on the shoulder.""Psst,"" he whispers, ""I know a great way to get money. Go up to an adult and say, 'I know the whole truth.'""""That'll work?"" Timmy asks, confused. ""How?""""No one knows. It just does. Try it!""""Well, thanks.""When Timmy comes home, he goes to his mother and tells her, ""I know the whole truth.""She immediately hands him a $20 banknote. ""Don't tell Daddy, okay?""Intrigued, Timmy goes up to his father and tells him, ""I know the whole truth.""He immediately gives him another $20. ""Don't tell Mommy, okay?""Happy with his investments, Timmy runs outside to greet the mailman passing by. ""I know the whole truth!"" he shouts from afar.The mailman freezes on his bicycle and stares at him. ""You… you do?""""Yes!""He looks around for a moment, then wipes a tear from his eye.""Then come give your real Daddy a hug!""#\#4 ""Four Letters""Mrs. Smith has given her class a homework task: to find the first 4 letters of the alphabet.Little Timmy goes to his mother and asks her what the first letter is. She is crying on the couch, and Timmy's father paces across the living room, fire in his eyes.""I'm sorry! It happened so long ago!"" she whimpers.Timmy writes that down in his notebook, then asks his father for the second letter.""Shut the fuck up!"" he screams at Timmy's mother, angry spit drooling down his twisted face. ""You're a lying, cheating whore!""Timmy writes that down as well, then goes to his older sister, who's sitting alone on her bed, crying quietly. He asks her for the third letter.""Leave me alone, you asshole!"" she shouts, so he writes that down.Finally, as he has exhausted his nuclear family, Timmy phones his grandmother and asks her for the fourth letter of the alphabet. ""D,"" she answers happily. Timmy thanks her and writes it down.The next day, when Mrs. Smith is going over the homework, she asks Timmy to share his findings. He pulls out his notebook and reads them off:""'I'm sorry! It happened so long ago!'""""Er…"" Mrs. Smith ers. ""The task was only given yesterday—""""'Shut the fuck up! You're a lying, cheating whore!'""Mrs. Smith gasps in horror, then collapses on the floor.""'Leave me alone, you asshole!' And… 'D.'""Proud of his homework, Timmy looks up to see his teacher lying motionless on the floor.""Mrs. Smith?""A deathly silence fills the classroom.""Did I do my homework good?""Timmy glances about nervously. Nobody is moving. They're all just staring at the teacher.#\#5 ""The Pediatrician""Little Timmy peeks through a door in the hospital. His mother is standing in front of the pediatrician's desk, looking distressed.""I just… I don't know what to tell you, Doctor. He's not getting any taller, his grades are getting lower, and his teachers say he hasn't grown socially.""""Well, Mrs. Anderson, not all children develop at the same rate. Timmy is just lagging behind a bit, and that's no cause for alarm.""""His friends are all 5 inches taller than him!""""If you'd like, we can send a DNA sample to thelab to test for any—""""No,"" she interrupts. ""No DNA tests. Please.""Bored, Timmy goes back to the waiting room and sees another kid sitting there, looking nervous. He asks him why he's here.""I'm getting my circumcision,"" he responds.""Oh,"" says Timmy. ""I know what it's like. I was circumcised just after I was born. I couldn't walk for a whole year!""#\#6 ""Division by Zero""Mr. Presley writes on the chalkboard ""4÷0"", crosses it, then turns to his class grimly. ""Now, children, it is important to note this fact: you are allowed to divide any number by any other number, but you must not divide by 0. This is one of the laws of mathematics: division by 0 is forbidden.""Little Timmy raises his hand.""Yes, Timmy?""""Why can't you divide by 0?""""Well, imagine that you wanted to walk 4 miles. If you walked at a rate of 0 miles per hour, which isthe same as not moving at all, how much time wouldyou need to walk 4 miles?""""Well, you would never reach 4 miles, because you're always standing in the same place, so it would take you forever; isn't it infinity?""""No, Timmy—4 divided by 0 is not infinity.""Timmy scratches his head again. ""Why not?""Another pupil chimes in: ""Because, Timmy, if you learn 0 things in Mr. Presley's lessons, even after infinity lessons you still wouldn't know anything!""#\#7 ""The Greener Grass""Little Timmy comes home from school, looking down. ""Mommy,"" he says, ""today we had to write a 120-word essay about a poem. Everyone else wrote 120, but I could only write 40!""""No matter,"" his mother sighs.""Why are they better than me?""""I don't know.""The next day, he comes home, once again looking dejected. ""Mommy, today we had to solve these weird equations. Everyone else could do them, but I couldn't figure out even one!""""No matter.""""Why are they smarter than me?""""I don't know.""The next day, Timmy comes home, yet again frowning. ""Mommy, today after gym class all the boys showered together and everyone else had big penises but I only had this!"" He pulls his pants down to show his little Timmy penis.""No matter,"" his embarrassed mother mutters.""Why are they bigger than me?""""Because,"" she says irritably, ""they're all 13 year olds, and you're somehow still 6!""#\#8 ""Tennis Balls""Little Timmy’s mother asks him what he wants for his 21st birthday tomorrow. ""Well, Mom,"" he begins, ""I want a tennis ball.""Confused but keen on making her son happy, she goes to the tennis ball shop and buys a tennis ball. The next day, Timmy opens his present and finds a tennis ball inside. ""Thank you so much, Mom! You are the bestest!""Five years later, Timmy's mother asks him what he wants for his 26th birthday. ""Mom, I know it's a lot to ask for, but I want 10 tennis balls.""Again slightly puzzled, she goes to the same tennis ball shop and buys her son 10 tennis balls. On his birthday Timmy is ecstatic and thanks her again. ""You are the bestest!""Ten years pass. Timmy's mother has put on some weight, and her hair has long since grayed. She phones her son and asks him if he'd like a present for his 36th birthday. ""Mommy,"" he says in his oh so sweet voice, ""I would like 100 tennis balls for my birthday.""At this point Timmy's request doesn't perplex her much. She just wants to make her son happy. She goes to the tennis ball shop the next day and purchases a cart full of tennis balls, which she gifts her son the following week. ""Thank you so much, Mom! You are the bestest!""Twenty years pass. Timmy's mother is lying on a hospital bed, hooked up to eleven machines, each doing its all to save her life. Her skin has grown brittle, and her fingers pale and bony. Breathing through her oxygen mask, she can dimly make out the silhouette of her son.""Timmy,"" she whispers, ""I want to make you the happiest boy before I depart. I know you that you'll want 1,000 tennis balls for your birthday, but I can't go buy them now. I hid a check for $30,000 in the car some time ago—that should be enough for all the tennis balls you'll ever need.""""Thank you, Mom,"" Timmy says. ""How could I ever repay you?""""Well, there's one thing you could tell me,"" she replies weakly, ""that would make me… very happy to know.""""Of course, Mom. Anything.""She takes a deep breath, or at least as deepest abreath she can muster. ""How?""""How what, Mom?""""How have you not grown up? It's been 50 years, and you're still the same as you were when you were 6 years old! Please, Timmy, tell me—tell me why you have not grown. Tell me why I never got to see you age. Please…""#\#9 ""Crying""Why is 6 year old Little Timmy crying?Well, he isn't having a midlife crisis, that's for sure. In fact, he hasn't aged in well over a century—all that time he has spent in the same prepubescent body. His nuclear family had vanished long ago, and now he wanders the cities in search of new friends.The passersby mostly ignore him, so he is free to roam from city to city as he wishes. He often stops at restaurants to order himself a nice meal. If there are no restaurants nearby, the odd falafel stand or pizza delivery will do.All this he can realize with the $30,000 check his mother had left for him all those years ago. It serves him well, and on those days when he feels exceptionally frisky, he might consider spending a night at some 2-star hotel, so that he could sleep soundly on a lukewarm bed for once.On other nights, Timmy will find a quiet place in some dank alley, rummage up a few stacks of old newspapers, and make himself as comfortable as can be lying down against them. If the alley offers him a clear view of the sky, he will lie on his back and gaze at the few stars he can count before drifting off to sleep.It's on these lowly nights that he will often ask himself how different his life would've turned out had he not been cursed with eternal childhood. He will never go on a rollercoaster ride, or see what the deal is with those 18+ comedy shows, or skateboard with other cool teenagers, or cuss in public without getting weird looks…He will never feel true love. Love is different when you get older. He learned that from the books he read. True love is exciting and scary and fun and warm and awesome all at once—but he will never feel that way towards anyone in his life. No one will hold him in the rain.Timmy cries.#\#10 ""A New Companion""One day, Little Timmy sits against the fence of an elementary school, just as the kids are going out to play. He closes his eyes and begins thinking, as he often does on such uninteresting days.Timmy still cannot understand the problem of division by 0. He has tried many times to ask travelers their intuition on the matter, but to no avail. In fact, many of the answers he received only confused him further—some said that something divided by 0 *is* infinity. Others told him it isn't, because, as they all argued, ""infinity is not a number."" He can't figure out why infinity can't be a number, or why the answer has to be a number at all. Doesn't infinity make more sense?""Heya!""Timmy turns to his left. There's a girl there, with a blue sweater and green pants, smiling behind the railing. ""Hello,"" he replies.""Why are you outside? How did you get out?""""I didn't. I was never inside.""""Then why are you sitting here?""""I dunno. Why are *you* sitting here?""""I asked first.""""I said I dunno!""""You aren't supposed to be outside.""""I'm not in school.""""What? Why?""""I dunno.""The girl giggles. ""I'm Madison. What's your name?""""Timmy.""""Are you new here?""""I guess so. I don't stay around very long. I just go wherever.""""I wish I could be like you. I hate school.""""Why?""""I dunno. I just wanna go home.""""Do you have friends?""""No. That's also why I don't like school. Cause I have no one to talk to.""""You can talk to me.""Madison smiles. ""But you said you don't stay around.""""I can stay around if you want me to. Then we can talk how much we want.""The bell rings, and the rest of the children head back into the building. ""Well, I have to go now,"" says Madison, ""but I'll be back soon. Don't go away!""She makes her way back to the school. Timmy smiles.#\#11 ""Mathematics""One day, Madison invites Little Timmy to her house, and he agrees happily. They do Madison's homework hastily, then until the sun settles they play video games. When the day is over and Madison waves goodbye to him, Timmy feels quite happy with himself, and to celebrate that night he checks in at a 3-star hotel.The next day, Timmy meets Madison at the schoolyard, and their meetings continue as usual. She brings her homework outside—he notices that she is taking a liking to math, though she is hesitant to admit this. ""I'm not a nerd,"" she protests, adjusting her round eyeglasses.At the end of that week, Madison again invites Timmy to her house. To his surprise, her homework is already done, but she continues scrolling through the pages of the textbook and learning new things. Their extracurricular meetings grow frequent, and by March they've already exhausted Madison's textbook. This upsets her, so Timmy suggests she borrow the next one from the library. ""What, for second grade?"" He nods.The next day, Madison skips out of the school building, the outline of a new textbook clearly visible under her sweater. Later, the two spend some time at her house ruffling through the pages, Timmy stopping occasionally to give brief summaries.""Tim, how are you so smart?"" Madison asks abruptly. ""You already know everything in this textbook, but you said you don't even go to school! How?""""Umm… It's a secret.""""I can keep secrets."" She holds up her hand as if to swear. ""Promise.""""Well… I, um…"" He leans closer to her. ""I'm not 6 years old.""""What?""""I mean, I *am* 6 years old, but I've been 6 years oldfor a really long time.""""How long?""""Hundreds of years.""Madison puts her hands on her mouth. ""Oh. My. God. That's so cool!""""Is it?""""Yeah, you're like a… a vampire, or something! Do you just not age at all?""""I wish I did. But Maddie, you can't tell anyone about this, okay?""She zips her lips. ""It won't leave this room. Our secret.""#\#12 ""Word of Mouth""What, didn't you get that last one? The joke is that it did leave that room. Not too long afterwards, either.Only a few days later, Madison passes the secret to one of her friends, with the repeated promise of not spreading it around. But you know how 6 year olds are. Soon most of the school knows about this mysterious vampire boy who comes to visit Madison every recess.Once the news makes its way from pupil to parent, it is met, unsurprisingly, with much skepticism. But every good rumor deserves a place in everyday gossip, so naturally the story goes around the block. The talk of this boy who can seemingly live forever catches the attention of a particular organization that just so happens to be visiting the city at the time. They want to further test this mystical immortal, and so their hunt begins.As the hotter months come round and the school year nears to a close, Timmy and Madison see each other after school more frequently. The problem of division by 0 eventually comes up in their textbook, and Timmy soon admits he doesn't understand it himself.""Wow, I didn't know there are things you don't understand!"" Madison jokes.Indeed, the first gaping hole in his knowledge he ever discovered—the first of many.One day, Timmy sees that Madison hasn't come to school, and so he goes to her house to check on her. It turns out she stayed at home because she is sick. She lies in bed with a thermometer in her mouth, looking discontented.""How are you feeling?"" Timmy asks.""Hot. And my head hurts.""""Can I buy you some ice cream?""She turns to his side and smiles. ""Sure. Thanks, Tim.""And so he goes down a few blocks to the nearest ice cream shop and buys two cones—chocolate for him, and strawberry-banana, Madison's favorite, for her, and goes back on his way happily.#\#13 ""Ice Cream""Why did Little Timmy drop his ice cream?Because he got hit by a truck.The massive force of a lorry ramming into a person does little more than nudge Timmy away, and the two cones he held fall to the ground.""Ouch,"" he mutters, rubbing his shoulder.The truck doesn't fare as well. It crashes to the side and overturns. Several people run out to investigate the commotion.Soon afterwards, numerous gray vans appear in the distance, stopping just a few yards away from Timmy. From them emerge a group of tall, fezzed men, all holding various firearms. They come out pointing their weapons at him, and the onlookers quickly run back inside.Someone in the back says a word and the men lower their guns. He walks through them and comes closer to Timmy, towering above him.""So,"" he exclaims with a thick foreign accent, ""*this* is the Vampire Boy. Timothy J. Anderson.""Timmy blinks.""I expect you'll be quite confused as to what just happened. But don't worry. Soon I will ensure your full potential is realized. You will help us, Timmy. You will bring justice to this terrible country. With you at our side, we'll become unstoppable.""""No,"" Timmy protests bravely. ""I refuse.""""I'm afraid it is not your choice to make, Timmy.""The next thing Timmy sees is the inside of a leather bag. He struggles to free himself, but the men holding him are stronger. They grab him and drag him into one of the vans, then they drive away to places unknown.#\#14 ""Knock Knock""""Who's there?"" Little Timmy cries, quaking in his seat, struggling with all his might to free himself from the metal chains.""Don't struggle,"" says that same, heavily accented voice. The man emerges from the shadows, stepping slowly towards Timmy. ""I am Xander Al-Tasamuh Qizi de-Wen Heviparez Jr.,but you—well, you may call me Joe.""""Joe who?"" Timmy whimpers.""That's not relevant, Timmy. There are more pressing matters at the moment.""He pulls a silver key out of his pocket and crouches behind Timmy. *Click*. The shackles that held him captive turn loose.""Hit me.""Timmy stands on his feet nervously and inspects his surroundings. There is almost nothing in this miserable place; only him, the chair, and that strange Joe. But the door is unlocked. He makes a run for it.""*AHHHHH!*""A horrible electric jolt throws Timmy on the floor with a harrowing yelp.""I must say, Timmy, I am a little disappointed that your immediate instinct when offered counsel is to rebel. But we foresaw that possibility.""Timmy sends a hand to his throat, but finds a metallic collar restricting it.""You are under our continuous supervision. We cannot kill you, but that only makes hurting you easier. Hit me.""Against all sense, Timmy tries to tug off his collar, but he is only rewarded with an immediate stronger jolt of electricity.""Hit me, Timmy! This is your destiny! This is what you were made for!""This must be hell. This must be hell. This must be hell.Timmy clasps Joe's hand and grabs his collar. The electricity streams from his neck, through his body and arms, and transfers to the bearded man's body, filling him with pain. He grunts weakly, then throws Timmy away like a ragdoll. ""Good.""#\#15 ""Walk in the Park""So there I am, hangin' out in the park, and I see this funny looking guy walking his dog, and I says to him, I says, ""'Ey, whatcha walkin' that donkey for?""The guy tells me, well, this ain't no donkey, it's a dog. And I goes like, ""I wasn't talking to you!""""Fuck you just said about me?"" he yells, brandishing a 9mm handgun.""Er… I, uh…""""No, no, say it again—say that stupid fucking wisecrack again, you cocksucker!""""I… Look, man, I'm not looking for trouble, i-it was just a joke!""""Get in the car."" He points at a distant gray van.""W-what?""""Get in the damn car, or I swear I'll blow your fucking head off. Now!""""Okay, okay, jeez!""I walk hastily to the car while the man prods me with his gun, his dog barking and biting the air. He drives me for a few hours, and the sun bleeds behind the window. Gosh, I never thought this is how I'd die. I wish I could see my daughter again. Just to tell her how proud I am of her, and how sorry I am that we couldn't spend more time together.We stop in a vast wheat field, made golden by rays of twilight. It's so quiet.""Get out.""I leave and watch the vehicle drive off to the horizon. When I turn around, there's a kid there, no older than 6 years. He's staring at me through glassy eyes.""They got you too, eh, kiddo?""The kid doesn't respond. I notice he's holding a small knife. How peculiar.#\#16 ""Mercenary""What do you call a 6-year-old holding a bazooka?*We now have direct confirmation that the Coalition utilizes a highly-trained assassin within both its military activity and its efforts of political repression. The Coalition has previously referred to this individual by the code name 'Çoban,' or 'Shepherd.'**Sources claim that the Shepherd is no more than 6 years of age; so far, all attempts of attacking him have suggested that he is indestructible; how this is achieved is currently unknown. The extent of the Shepherd's martial capabilities is known to be devastating—I have thus reason to believe that he was employed liberally during the Coalition's coup.**In light of these recent developments, we propose to coordinate an air raid on the Coalition primary headquarters, which we've been informed are located in Lovington, New Mexico. The 200-kiloton yield should debilitate the Coalition for a time. I hope that, with sorrow for the lives that this bombing may inevitably take, you'll see that the need to employ these measures outweighs anything else in these troubled times.**We are in contact with many rebelling groups in the United States, and we have ensured that they are all far from the dangers this decision will impose. We have also been working with them to cripple the Shepherd, though it remains to be seen whether these efforts will amount to anything in the near future. He proves an acutely distressing enemy of humanity and mankind.**Best regards. —Candice Dickfield*#\#17 ""Explosive Yield""Where did Little Timmy go when the bomb fell?*Everywhere*.*Everywhere* is a remote town in northwestern Texas, with genial farmers, shopkeepers and miners keeping the economy bountiful. Or, I guess it used to be.I'd lived in Everywhere for some time when the Coalition took over. It happened mere months ago, and yet somehow it feels like it's always been this way. The well has always been dry. The watchmen have always been armed. The peace has always been distant. This is the way it's always been.The bomb fell at dawn. I heard a low rumble as the shockwave passed through town, and that was that. John said there was nothing to see. I don't know. I was too busy tweaking the landmines for when the—*""Shepherd detected! All units, abandon posts and evacuate! Repeat, abandon posts and evacuate!""*There he is. The Shepherd arrives at the front of town, inspecting the area like a tiger ready to spring. And spring he will… just a few more steps—*Click*. *Bang!* A notorious fireball encompasses the Shepherd, surely hot enough to melt his weaponry. And indeed, once the smoke has settled, there are no guns left to threaten… and the charred, naked body of the Shepherd yet stands.Everything is going according to plan.I tiptoe downstairs. John gives me a hug. ""Incredible! You're incredible!"" he half-whispers, half-shouts.""Thank you,"" I giggle. ""Do you know where the—""And the next moment, John collapses on the floor, a chunk of wood piercing his abdomen.I scream. Someone comes through the window. He leaps onto me and grasps my throat. I struggle for air but he doesn't let go. Everything hurts. John is dead and it's all my fault. Everything is going dark. We failed, and I'm going to die. Everything is falling away. I don't wanna die. *I don't wanna die!*""…Maddie?""#\#18 ""The Burning Bush""The Shepherd has been captured. The Shepherd is held captive in this jet. The Shepherd is immobilized.I still cannot believe these statements are true. Yet, here we are.""Horeb Alpha, do you read?""""Loud and clear.""""Great. Well, first off, I'd like to congratulate you all on the successful capture of the Coalition's primary mercenary. You had a lot of us very nervous on first contact.""""No need, Everywhere's already done most of the job."" He chuckles. I would chuckle too, but I am still very much in shock.""Their efforts will not go unrewarded, either. I trust you are now taking him to the Mexico basin?""""Yes, sir.""""Good. If all goes well, we might just live to see the end of the Coalition's rein. Well done, gentlemen. I will see you up ahead.""""Roger.""I look out the window and try to put things in perspective. It's weird to think that, in just a few months, things could possibly go back to normal. Even the idea that we actually might have a chance to win the war—it almost feels too good to be true, though I should probably avoid that line of thought considering how bitterly ironic it usually turns out to—""Roger!""""What?""""The kid. Look at the kid, Roger.""The kid? Oh, *him*. That black, scorched body of a 6 year old, somehow still alive. The same 6 year old responsible for the downfall of the most powerful government in the world. The same 6 year old that slaughtered hundreds of thousands of my brethren. That same 6 year old is now bolted to a steel chair in the back of the jet, stripped of anything that would make him even remotely powerful. Even so, I am still hesitant to approach him. His eyes are open wide, and he is mouthing something, staring into the distance.""What is it?"" I ask tentatively.""…w…wa…fo…di…""""What?""""…f…four…divided…zero…""""What's he saying, Roger?""""I-I don't know. It sounds like he's trying to say 'four divided by zero.'""""Huh? What's that supposed to mean?""""Look, can we just drop him already? I'm really not comfortable being so close to him.""""We'll be there in a couple klicks.""#\#19 ""Lucidity""Little Timmy plunges into the Gulf of Mexico from 40,000 feet in the air. He, of course, survives the fall, but so does the metallic chair that keeps him bolted in place. He tries to struggle from the chains, but they do not yield. He just sinks deeper and deeper into the infinite abyss, farther and farther from the light, and closer and closer to oblivion.But he never reaches that point. Much like the reciprocals of the tiniest numbers, there is no limit to his descent because such a limit would be—well, who knows?Timmy can't breathe.He can't die, either. Whatever mysterious force keeps him alive surrenders to nothing, not even to the impossibility of having enough oxygen to be conscious whilst suspended in water. In fact, this force seems to go so far as to torture Timmy in order to keep him alive, because he is still very conscious and aware of the fact that he can't breathe.This goes on for about 1 billion years. Who knows what humanity has achieved in the meantime? I'm sure it was of great value. Whatever accomplishments they have made will undoubtedly be appreciated by the cold, uncaring cosmos they leave in their wake.When Timmy finally emerges from the water, it's not because someone took mercy on him, or because some alien discovered the remains of the planet. No, it is simply due to the one force that cannot touch Timmy whatsoever—time. The sun has grown brighter with it, and the temperatures on Earth rose so high that all the oceans have completely evaporated, leaving Timmy on dry land.Of course, by this point all the oxygen and means of producing it are long gone, so Timmy is still continuously suffocating. He's just not wet anymore, and it's also a lot hotter. You can probably assume that the chair is gone, so he's just writhing around on the seabed, suffocating and consciously experiencing every possible bit of pain from it.6.5 billion years later, the sun has expanded and become a red giant, and its gigantic form has swallowed the Earth whole. So now Timmy is also being cooked alive at temperatures that would normally vaporize a human instantly. He probably enters orbit somewhere in the midst of the plasma about the core of the sun.Let's skip forward a bit. After billions of years of pain—sorry, trillions of years… no, that's not right.

""The catch, is that when you entered the bar, I scanned your brain and determined which choice you would make.

An apple a day keeps the doctor away.,"That was they said, but they were mistaken, and it was a huge mistake. The truth is that it goes in both directions. You could say just as well that doctor a day keeps the apple away, and that was the important part. We were led to believe that only the first part matters and somehow, insidiously, so slowly that we didn't realize, that led us to believe that doctors were bad, that we needed to keep them away. And once we did, once we got rid of all the doctors, there was nobody left to stop the apples. Their plan worked perfectly, because we were too foolish to trust the doctors. There's nothing we can do now, it's too late. Let's just bow our heads and surrender to the inevitable. The world now belongs to the apples, and we will only be an afterthought in the books of history, something they stepped on in their way to conquering the planet.

A NTSB investigator is investigating plane wreckage on the I-90 near Sioux Falls,"An investigator from the NTSB is investigating wreckage from a plane crash on the I-90 near Sioux Falls, SD.Although the main wreckage was mostly on the stretch of highway near Sioux Falls, debris and other parts of the aircraft were scattered across northern Iowa and southern Minnesota, making this a very stressful operation indeed.What had made matters even worse was that no commercial aircraft had reported being in difficulty and it was still proving difficult to determine which airline the apparently large aircraft was registered to, especially given that no airline had reported any aircraft missing or unaccounted for.Similarly, contacts at NORAD had proven difficult to communicate with.As the investigator got closer to the remaining section of the body of the plane, he frowned. Everybody could see half of a US flag emblazoned on the side of the body, but no accompanying insignia or logo or letters.Judging from the shape and size of the fuselage, it looked as if the wreckage could have been that of a 747 airliner, however the investigator couldn't be sure.No response from NORAD. Nothing from the Air Force. Nothing from any airlines. Not even a response of acknowledgment from the White House. This was all very strange.Suddenly, an excited shout broke the grim silence.""Hey!"" A young South Dakota highway patrolman shouted excitedly. ""I've found something!""The highway patrolman was waving what appeared to be a passport.As the investigator got closer, he gasped. More passports were strewn across the ground near some debris but...but he immediately saw that they were old-style British passports.As he grabbed hold of a few and quickly thumbed through them, his shock was paralyzing. On some passports, he saw birth-years ranging from 1896 to 1929 and dates of validity ranging from 1946 to 1951.This was bizarre. The highway patrolman grinned up at him. ""Like something outta the X-Files, huh?""The investigator stared back in stunned silence.The simulation then ended.The instructor strode out from his cubicle and approached the lectern, as his 2,679 students also exited their cubicles and sat down beside them.""As you can clearly see, this investigator has failed to follow Protocols G through W. Obviously he should've have pressed for a speedy response from NORAD, the Air Force and the White House. Also, given the clear 'Special Situation' created by the passports, he should've escalated immediately. That's no small-town investigator - he's federal. No airlines reporting anything; a large 747-like aircraft crashing in broad daylight; nothing on radar minutes before? All points to a clear case of the 'Special Situation' and that's where you and I come in.""",47,AntiAntiJokes.csv

Epstein is still alive, gang!""Jeffrey Epstein remarks: ""Great observation by the frat boy asshole over here! Yes, I'm obviously still alive and have been seeking shelter here!""Fred continues explaining the narrative: ""Yup! All this time you have been scaring people off in order to be left alone in here. Good grief, school is about to start as well. It's a good thing we caught you here before you could get your filthy mittens on any of the students here!""""...and I would've gotten away with it too, was it not for my inclination of meddling with kids."" Jeffrey Epstein replies.""Well, that settles it, gang! Let's call the FBI!"" Fred says. Daphne looks around the room and says: ""Wait, where is Velma?""Shaggy and Scooby Doo shrug, Jeffrey Epstein shrugs and so does Fred. Daphne finally shurgs as well and says: ""Oh, well. Let's carry this guy into the van, leave and call the FBI already. This place is still giving me the creeps!""Shaggy says to Scooby Doo: ""You know what this means, huh? Time for a Scooby Snack!"" Scooby Doo replies: ""Rawesome! Ret's go rab some Rooby Sn-..""""For the love of god, shut the fuck up!"" Epstein interjects.

Just stop talking and get me out of here and away from you all.""""Uh oh! Looks like a certain someone could use a Scooby Snack as well!"" Fred remarks.

A man is taken by the cops to go and identify four bodies which are believed to be his four brothers,"He looks at the first one. The skin is lifeless and pale; half of the body's head is missing and a leg is gone; but it looks like it's Peyton, his second oldest brother.He nods.""This one's Peyton. Tattoo on the left side of the neck; it's him.""He looks at the second body, or rather what's left of it. Only the right side of the body is present. The body has been neatly cut into half and the left side could not be recovered. It was definitely Yannick, his second youngest brother; the pointy nose was obvious.""Yannick,"" he says.Just two bodies left.A sheet is pulled back and gasps fill the room.""Shit,"" the assistant says. ""Sorry, wrong body!""The man looks on, horrified, as he catches sight of the head. It looked like something out of the X-Files or Project Blue Book; a giant grey head with large black eyes, slits in place of a nose and thin grey lips - an alien.Panic sweeps the room.""What the fuck is this?!"" One of the Canadian cops screams angrily.The assistant panics. Klaxons begin sounding.Men in smart black suits and posh black sunglasses quickly pile into the room. Two of them bring out what appear to be larger-than-normal iPhone 11s, large white smartphones about 8 inches in length. A high-pitched noise is emitted from both phones and a blinding white light fills the room, completely disorientating everybody in the room.***Five hours later, the Canadian Parliament has been dissolved, the Canadian Prime Minister has declared a nationwide public state of emergency and 3 US carriers and their carrier strikes groups with them are bearing down on the Canadian east coast. Iran has formally declared war on seventeen nations (the first nation to do so in decades), the US included and Somalia has demanded that Canada return the alien specimens which it discovered in Somalian territory.The world is at war and Russian troops are swarming Beijing, massacring Chinese troops and citizens alike like marauding Viking invaders pillaging and plundering villages in historical Europe.2036 is a very bad time to be alive.Meanwhile, the Zeta Reticulians look on from their secret base on Mars, poised to conduct a large-scale campaign of vengeance against Earth for what they will say is in response to the kidnap, torture and murder of peaceful unarmed Zeta Reticulian scouts sent to Africa to make first contact.",2,AntiAntiJokes.csv

An easily persuaded man that also perceives everything that's said literally walks into a bar.,"Once at the bar, he orders a beer and notices an sightly older disheveled man that is looking down at the counter while drinking his sorrows away. The disheveled man notices that he's being observed and says to the other man: ""What? You never seen a man drink before? What the fuck are you staring at?""The man replies: ""Huh? I have indeed seen a man drink before. I'm even seeing one right now as we speak. Also, I'm staring at you.""The disheveled man sneers at the man and replies: ""You smartass, you don't want to go there with me, not tonight!"" to which the man says: ""I'm a smart ass? I didn't know posteriors had any mental faculties of their own but I guess you're correct. I don't know what place it is you're alluding to that I don't want to travel to with you, but maybe another night then?""The disheveled man becomes angrier and stutters when he replies: ""Y-you..f-fuc..what? You and me, outside, now!"" The man nods, turns on his heels and walks outside the bar. The disheveled man follows with clenched fists. Once they're outside the disheveled man says: ""You're going to get it now!""The man replies: ""Really? I didn't know you had a suprise for me, sir. What is it?"" The disheveled man just eyes the man, disconcerted and says to him: ""The fuck? You know what, just get lost and then go fuck yourself."" The man shrugs and walks away from the establishment.The man tries to process what was said to him and figure out what to do next. He eventually comes up with a plan, orders a plane ticket to Brazil, packs a few items and boards a plane. He spends the next week trekking the Amazon rainforest until he loses his orientation. Once he becomes aware that he's lost, he goes behing a tree and attempts to penetrate himself with his own penis but fails. He spends the next month attempting to figure out where he is and manages to finally escape the rainforest.More than a month later, the man walks into the same bar. The disheveled man sits at the same bar stool he did more than a month earlier. He sees the man and yells: ""Oh! Look at what the fucking cat dragged in!""The man shoots a few quick glances around himself, then he replies: ""Pardon? I don't see a cat around. Where is it, sir?"" The disheveled man loses his temper once again and says: ""You're a son of a bitch! Go take a hike, right now."" The man replies: ""I'm sorry. While I'm probably the son of a bitch and as much as I'd like to oblige, I already spent the last month hiking and I can not afford another trip. Is there anything else I can do instead?""The disheveled man yells: ""You and me, outside, now!"" The man nods and walks outside and the disheveled man follows once again. Once they're outside the disheveled man says: ""You fucking ready?"" The man replies: ""Ready for what exactly?"" The disheleved man replies: ""Ready to have your own ass handed to you, that's what!"" The man says in return: ""I'm not entirely sure whether that's possble, sir. Maybe if you had a butchers knife or a saw to deattach it.""The disheveled man becomes even more infuriated and yells: ""What is wrong with you?! Are you autistic or something?! Jesus, you know what? I'm not about to beat on some retard, just go fuck yourself rather."" The man replies: ""I already tried that, it's not possible, sir.""The disheveled man yells again: ""W-what? Then go fuck your mother instead!"" The man replies: My mother was cremated and had her ashes spread 2 years ago sir, otherwise I'd do it."" The disheveled man yells: ""Goddamnit! Go fuck someone next in succession then. Go fuck your sister!? Does that work!?""The man replies: ""I have no siblings nor any family left, sir."" The disheveled man yells again:"" Just shut up, get a condom, suit up and then go fuck whatever seems logical to you at this point! I'm done with you!"" The man shrugs and leaves for the store to buy a condom, he then goes to his home where he puts on his best suit. He then re-enters the bar and hour later. He orders a shot and notices the disheveled man sitting on the same stool.He approaches him and asks: ""Excuse me, sir. You still live on Remington Avenue with your family, number 34, correct?"" The disheveled man looks up at the man and says: ""What? Yes. What's it to you?"" The man drinks his shot and says: ""I'm gonna go fuck your mother, sir. Wish me luck!""The man is still hospitalized and has been in a deep coma for over a year.",10,AntiAntiJokes.csv
A vivid man walked into a bar.,"He had the wildest and most chaotic brain in the earth. He could spell of horrors rivaling the unknown that lurk in the vast recesses of outer space.He could pacify the dozens and dozens with these stories, all using his brain. Once he told me, that bartender who's been serving me drinks for the past 23 years, had been hiding a gigantic 🍆. (I've censored what he said with emojis so that you won't be in grave danger.) I asked, ""You're kidding me, right? I wholeheartedly refuse to believe that man has even an above average 🍆, more so a goliath of a 🍆"".But the vivid man whispered to me, ""Look, and you will see a circus."" And so, reluctantly, I asked the bartender, If I could see his 🍆. I have to admit, I have seen some 🍆 in my life, but all of them were shivering and miniscule compared to what the vivid man described. The bartender was half-embarrassed and half-amused. He has been waiting for the day to reveal his 🍆 to his family, but was afraid if they would shun him or not. He figured that I could give an opinion if this was a 🍆 to show or a 🍆 to hide. And so he dropped his 🍆 on the table, making a clap that angels could hear. I was tranced. Albeit in a horrifying way, doubting everything that I had known up to this point. This was not a 🍆 to be admired, but why was I so seduced by it? My wife, my children, I feel as if I have to abandon them, just because this 🍆 has entered my purview. This magnificent and malignant 🍆, both destroyed my life and gave me a reason to start again. I wanted to kiss his 🍆. To hug his 🍆. To beg for his 🍆 as if it was oxygen. This 🍆 was now my salvation, my messiah, my provider. The 🍆 would feed me when I was starving. The 🍆 would spare me some liquid when I was thirsty. This 🍆 was my fountain where I would rest and bathe and worship. No, no, no, no. This can't be, that 🍆 is not perfect. It is just as fragile as me, as human as me, as needing of protection as me. The 🍆 has to know that we both are broken, but with each other, the 🍆 and I can be as one. I will let the 🍆 enter my body. I will let the 🍆 penetrate my mind. I am ready to take the blow to protect this 🍆. The 🍆 will replenish me with periodic strength, while I shield the 🍆 from harm. The 🍆 and I are destined to be with each other, knowing it has picked me and I have picked the 🍆. I cannot thank the vivid man enough for letting me know of the 8th wonder of nature. The 🍆 is drooling with enthusiasm and I am too. The bartender as well is happy for me, having been freed of his 🍆 burden. The 🍆 and I lived happily ever after. The End. The listeners asked me, ""Where is the punchline? I thought this was an elaborate dick joke."" The punchline is you dumdum. I have made you read smut by making you fill in the blanks that were never there.",1,AntiAntiJokes.csv

3 mothers are having a conversation at a Walmart parking lot while carrying their babies.,"The conversation eventually starts turning more contentious and competitive. They start comparing babies, one of them slaps her baby on top of its head forcefully and exclaims:""See this thing? This baby can scream at a whopping 120 decibels, that's louder than a lion! It also operates at 40 tantrums per minute. Pretty awesome, huh? I just got it, almost fresh out of the womb! It has that new baby smell, have a whiff! Smell it!""The second woman smells it and replies: ""Pfft! Oh yeah? While that's all mildly impressive, can it do this?!"" She says, before throwing her baby at a wall. The baby ricochets off the wall and towards the ground. It then bounces off the ground and back into the her arms.""Bam! That's right! I'd like to see yours do that! It's called super elastic skin, Martha, giving it rebounding properties."" She says proudly, while pinching her baby's cheek and stretching its skin several inches off its face. The baby starts to cry.The third woman starts talking: ""Ooooh! Big whoop! Want to see something amazing? Watch this!"" She puts her baby down onto the ashphalt and starts to pile several large bricks on top of it. ""See how durable this thing is? I swear, it can withstand at least 3500 pounds! I could go on piling thousands of these bricks!""""Bullshit, Susan! That's about the weight of an average car! Prove it!"" The first woman demands.The third woman, seemingly up to the challenge, nods confidently and says back: ""Gladly! Observe this shit, Sarah!"" She knocks the pile of bricks off the baby, picks it up and throws it into the path of an oncoming car.The car comes to a screetching halt after running the baby over and the driver, another woman, hustles out of the car in disbelief. The baby is dead and lies disfigured on the parking lot. ""Oh my god! Oh my god! Why did you do that?! I can't believe this, I can't...""The first two women of the group look at the third woman while smirking. One of the two remarks: ""Well that turned out to be a complete crock! iT cAn wItHstAnD at LeAsT 3500 pOuNdS. You liar, you.""The third woman retorts: ""I swear, it could! There must be something inside that car that's giving it an extraordinary amount of additional weight!""The female driver looks at the other women in shock and screams: ""What is WRONG with you three?! Are you NOT aware of what just happened?!""The third woman abruptly points at the car and yells: ""Ah! Aha! I knew it! See? There's your culprit!John Goodman eventually finishes climbing out of the car as well and shoots a glance behind the car. He then looks at the woman and says: ""I don't even weigh that much anymore, you dumb bitch! You're supposed to deflate them first to get rid of the air pressure.""",56,AntiAntiJokes.csv

One day there was a train conductor going about his day...,"Having conducted trains for over 20 years, today was just like any other day. He pulled up to a stop and gently brought the train to a halt . As the doors open, passengers enter. He goes to close the doors and as he does an old man is slowly racing for the train.He trips, falling onto the tracks.Seeing this, the conductor snaps, and drives the train over the old man.2 years pass. The conductor is sitting on death row, moments before he is due to be electrocuted. A guard comes in, and asks what he would like for his last meal?“Just one banana.” Says the man. The guard is confused.“You can have anything, sir.” Says the guard. “The finest banana you can find.” Says the man. A few moments pass, and the guard approaches the conductors cell.“One banana. The best I could find.”And so, the conductor proceeds to eat the banana. Extremely slowly. He peels off the skin, those little dangly bits, and eventually every last bit.“Are you finished?” Says the guard.“Yes” says the man.He is taken to the electric chair. There is priest praying on behalf of the man. And once the word is given, a guard presses a button and engages the shock.Nothing happens.The mans lawyer is there. He argues that the man has received his punishment.He wins this case, and is set free.*Years pass, the man is, somehow, back behind the console of a large train. Significantly older now.It’s a normal day, and he is driving the train. As he comes to a halt and let’s passengers on, a young pregnant woman is rushing to make the train. She trips onto the tracks.The conductor snaps, and runs over the lady.A year has passed. The man is, again, on death row awaiting electrocution. A guard approached the cell.“What’ll it be?” The guard says. “One banana please.” Says the man. “Again?” Says the guard. “The finest banana you can find.” Says the man.Sure enough, the guard returns shortly after with an amazing banana. It’s shiny and fresh and better than before. The man takes his time to eat the banana, slowly peeling back the skin and finishing it off.“Ready” says the guard.“Yes.” Says the man.Just like before, the man is taken to an even better electric chair. He is strapped in 10 times tighter with double the connections.“He won’t get away this time” says the head guard.They press a button, sending a lethal amount of electricity to the man, but yet again fails to kill him.“How can this be happening!” They all exclaim.And because the laws in this region are broken, the man is again free to go.*A few months later, the man has escaped to a far part of the world. Managing to hide his identity and get a job as a train conductor.He’s driving along one day, just as normal, he’s extremely old now and can barely see.  All of a sudden, someone jumps in front of the train.Despite it being an accident, because of his track record the man is again sent to death row.The time has come, it’s a year later, decades before the first time and the man is in the exact same cell as before.“I don’t know how this keeps happening. But here is your banana.” The guard says.“Thank you.” Says the man.It’s now the moment of truth, if this does not work a third time the man has beaten the system and once again sent free.He’s sitting in the electric chair, the priest cannot bring himself to say a prayer to this monster. Every guard in the prison is surrounding the man as he is strapped into the chair in every way possible.The head guard walks over to the control panel, sweat dripping down his face. Everyone is looking at him, anxiously awaiting the moment the life leaves the mans eyes.He presses a button.Nothing...........“HOW ARE YOU STILL ALIVE?” Says the guard in a rage of confusion. The man sits still, and looks the guard straight in his eyes, and finally opens his mouth after a long moment and says: “I’m just not a very good conductor.”",0,AntiAntiJokes.csv

The Apple Of Eden,"""Yo dawg check out this sweet crispy apple,"" Adam said as he was chilling and twiddling with his fig leaf. He started to ponder why exactly he had this leaf in place of a penis and how exactly he knew what penises were. God gave Adam a glare that just read ""Don't you try it kid or I'll add you to my torture porn collection."" and it made him shit himself.   Adam was starting to grow tired of naming all the wildlife gibberish names to appease god. All of his time was either spent doing this or shitting all over the place. It was genuinely growing into a problem as he constantly had to be wary of stepping in his own fecal matter. He had started using the wildlife as towels even. All of god's creations were slowly one by one getting crusted with dried human shit as Adam wiped his feet off on them. Luckily god hadn't programmed them to be anything but docile yet so Adam had been enjoying this freedom almost a little too much. All of a sudden Adam had an epiphany.  Could he reach far enough to fit his fig leaf into his mouth if he had one less rib bone? He wondered how it would taste like. Perhaps he could spin this to god somehow and get his rib out so he could try this experiment? ""Hey man, so you know how you made me in your image and all? If I'm like part godly and all I probably don't need all of my rib bones so you can take one and do whatever you want man. My treat!"" Adam said to God above. He scratched his neck a little in anticipation for the answerGod pondered for a moment and stroked his bushy ginger beard. This was before the grey hairs set in.  ""Perhaps I can forge you a sister for you to copulate with."" he said before sketching out his plan. After many rough drafts that night he settled on throwing testicles on her chest to tell them apart. God gave one snap of the finger and suddenly Adam had one less rib bone. Adam looked up to see God's new creation whilst in the midst of auto-fellatio and noticed that she had no nipples. It was disgusting. It turned him off entirely. Eve took her first step into Adam's shit.",55,AntiAntiJokes.csv
A little long but worth reading....,"A handsome man went into a hotel and asked to see the boss. When the boss came, the story began.-The client: is room 39 empty?-The boss: yes, sir.-The client: can I book it?-The boss: of course you can.-The client: thank you.Before going to the room, the client asked the boss to provide him with a black knife, a white thread 39 cm and an orange 73g.The boss agreed though he was surprized at the weird things the client asked to have.The client went into his room, he didn't ask for food or anything else.Unfortunately for the boss, his room was next to room 39.After midnight, the boss heard strange voices and noise in that client's room. Voices of wild animals and of utensils and dishes being thrown on the floor.The boss didn't sleep that night. He kept thinking and wondering what might be the source of the noise.In the morning, when the client handed the keys to the boss, the latter asked to see the room first.He went to the room and found everything alright. Nothing unusual. He even found the thread, the black knife and the orange on the table.The client paid the bill and gave the bellboys a very good tip and left the hotel smiling.The boss was in a shock but he didn't reveal what he heard to the bellboys. In fact, he started to doubt himself.After one year, the client showed up again. He asked to see the boss again. The boss was in a puzzle.The client asked the same things: room 39, black knife, white thread 39cm and an orange 79g.This time, the boss wanted to know the truth by all means possible. He spent a sleepless night, waiting for something to happen. After midnight, the same voices and noises started, this time louder and more indecipherable than the year before.Again, before leaving, the client paid his bill and left a large tip on the table for the bellboys. The smile didn't leave his face.The boss started searching for the meaning of everything the client asked to have. Why did he ask room 39? why the white thread? why the black knife??? In fact, the boss didn't arrive to any convincing answer to all these questions.The boss now was eagerly waiting for the month of March, the month in which the client showed up. To his surprise, on the first day of March, the same client showed up. He asked the same questions. Wanted to book the same room, wanted to have the same things as before.The boss again heard the same noises, this time more louder than before.In the morning, when the client was leaving the hotel, the boss apologized politely to the client and asked to know the secret behind the noises in the room.-''If I tell you the secret, do you promise to never reveal it to anyone else?''-''I promise I will never let anyone know''.-''Swear''-''I swear I won't reveal your secret''So finally, the client revealed his secret to the boss.

The beer I'm currently drinking has its own personality. I like it.,"Its the same beer I drank when I was 18, at a field party; this time was also the seventh time I had drank alcohol, and back then I had no interest in the taste or emotions that come with beer drinking.Anyone who knows me now, knows a 44 year old craft beer guzzling, chicken wing loving, rough and tough tumbler who can dive into the spiciest hot wings on the menu, and not flinch but die inside sweating in my tight fitting suit jacket to impress the female business woman sitting at the end of the bar of the Applebees bar I'm sitting at. That's me now, and the beer I'm drinking came across as familiar when I remembered that field party, and the stumbling around in the woods as my legs felt wobbly, I couldn't control myself.That night, my friends dad gave us his blessing, and packed us a 24 pack of craft beers. The asshole included IPAs and Imperial Stouts, which all tasted like shit to me at the time, so I had drank straight rum instead, and became a very wobbly, innocent and harmless chubby boy walking around with an erection showing through my basketball shorts. Exactly as Tucker Max predicted, eventually my tactic worked, and a decent ""5"" walked over to me and looked up at me with red eyes. She had obviously been crying and that made me uncomfortable. She said she had told her boyfriend she felt sorry for me standing all by myself chugging rum in the ""background of the best years of his own life"". The boyfriend, being the jealous type, decided this meant she wanted to cheat on him and a fight had started. She tried to explain she only wanted to make me feel welcome to the party, instead of waiting all night to be invited to walk up the driveway.And then I fell into the brush with the girl. It's not how it sounds...she had practically dragged me out there in the thick brush of the forest when she said she wanted me to try a beer, but didn't want to make the ""guy she was at the party with"" jealous. This guy did look much stronger than me, and I sure didn't want to get beaten up again, as several people had done to me at the previous 6 parties I had attended. I thought I had prepared appropriately, and was ready to be a party animal but I apparently I was wrong.I guess I didn't really train appropriately, since my party animal training consisted only of drinking my parents vodka, alone, while masturbating to printed pictures of Yoko Ono. This reinforced behaviour, through the influx of dopamine flowing through my veins for hours at a time, caused me to become more advanced, being able to drunkenly bob my head to house music. During this time, while I fapped to the wife of the late Beatle, I tried not to think about John, who from what I recall, had died in a car accident, while being attacked by a high Ringo Starr, after Canada Day celebrations had gotten out of hand in New York City.Anyways, there I sat, now resting on the hammock, with the girl. While whispering a standard consentual sex agreement to me, I could only listen to understand her tone was positive, since her breath smelled so strongly of cigarettes, I mostly focused on not gagging at the holes in her teeth. Finally, she nodded her head and pulled out her tit, and told me if I sucked, she would pump out the best beer. Me being a budding atheist, it was necessary to accept her offer, as the experience could provide useful insights into the Monk culture, who are known for their beer drinking rituals.Upon me initiating my obligation to extract beer from her boob, I noticed that only a warm white liquid was coming out, to which a man behind me approached, hat in hand and said, ""The lines in the keg haven't been changed since Covid started, mista. You're drinking last February's yeast infection"".I spit out the filth from my mouth. Put back on my foam cowboy hat, and galloped away with my friends dad's beer cooler.It wasn't until I was back at the party, panting in the bed of a pickup truck close to the fire, in the middle of the keg stand station, when I realized - sometimes drinkig beer out of a tit isn't worth the milk that comes with it.",3,AntiAntiJokes.csv

"It's been a tough day for Aleksandr Lermontov, son of Lavrentiy Lermontov of LermoCorp","Aleksandr Lermontov (nicknamed Lermontov Jr) has been under a great deal of stress lately. The Soviet government has been putting more and more pressure on him and LermoCorp to increase the firepower of Superman.Lermontov Jr had been working feverishly day and night to fully harness the power of *Purple Kryptonite* and *Serbian Kryptonite* (a particularly special element which had been discovered in Serbia in the aftermath of a meteor strike in 2033).Serbian Kryptonite enabled Superman to take over the minds of any human within 400 miles of him. However, Lermontov Jr had found during experiments that there was a major problem: if an individual was sufficiently mentally strong or had hidden mental superpowers, they could resist and actually end up taking over Superman's own mind. Lermontov Jr was especially worried that the Americans were aware of this and that they were recruiting a team of super-powered ""C-Men"", psychic-powered superbeings who could, collectively as a whole, take over Superman's mind and make him work for US interests - especially horrible given that Superman was raised in Vladivostok since he was a baby ever since his spaceship landed there.Lermontov Jr was particularly stressed because he had so far omitted to inform the Soviet government of this major problem which, if it came to pass, could lead to the destruction of the Soviet Union as we know it.Just another day on Earth in the 2040s.",70,AntiAntiJokes.csv

A Round of Double Jeopardy,"What is it, darling? You want to REALLY know what happened that night? Well you're lucky baby girl, I'm the narrator of this obtuse story we got right here, so why don't you just sit right back and enjoy the show.Trebek had tinnitus. But it wasn't just your gramma's tinnitus, his had voices that would tell him the right questions to every answer. But today, they were telling him something very different.""Ohh Lordy-doo... never thought I'd be so erotically seduced by a man older than me..."" thought Trebek. ""Alex, Alex, keep it in your pants, we have a show to run."" And so he announced the Categories for Double Jeopardy. ""and lastly, Anti-Anti-Jokes"" said Trebek, to which his Tinnitus retorted.Tinnitus: What is this whole subreddit about? ""I'll take Anti-Anti-Joke for 400, Alex. "" said Chekhov with a winky face. ""Oh, don't you wink at me... "" said Trebek. And the tinnitus retorted again. Tinnitus: What would the reader say about me dropping meta hints like acknowledging it's all meta? ""Just look at his hunk of a figure, ohh and his guns are so oily and wet... I bet that he's hiding a massive bush down there, like astroturf."" Trebek thought while daydreaming about Chekhov. ""A sentient dreidel walked into a bar. "" said Trebek, to which his Tinnitus retorted productively. Tinnitus: What is a setup? ""What is a punchline?"" said Chekhov, flexing with his ginormous guns. They're just oiled up to perfection, you know? ""Just this once, I'll give you a do-over."" said Trebek. The tinnitus then retorted. Tinnitus: What should I say to the readers who still don't understand that I'm making a question to a previous statement said by somebody, showing the meta-narrative of this anti-anti-joke? Is this even an anti-anti-joke? Does this even count as a joke? Am I going crazy? Trebek was now annoyed by his Tinnitus having an existential crisis. But he needed it, because he needed the questions. He lathered oil on himself to destress. ""What is a punchline?"" said Chekhov, again, not knowing what a setup is. In fact all he knows is how to punch, with those oiled up GUNS. Punch Punch Punch.Trebek was now annoyed by both his Tinnitus and Chekhov. But Chekhov is still hot AF, and beneath his bush lays his hypothetical scrotum. We know he has a scrotum, but does he have the balls? Are they as big as a grape? A grapefruit? A cartwheel? A cart? Or are they none of the above? ""I'll have Anti-Anti-Joke for 800."" said Chekhov, like a male dominatrix. ""You can't do that."" said Trebek. Tinnitus: What do we say to authors who just introduce a plot element out of the blue without setting it up first?Chekhov then took out the Bible, and with Jesus Christ, commanded unto Trebek: ""Of course I could, it's an anti-anti-joke dumdum."" Then flew away riding with Jesus on a double-entendre. The tinnitus retorted: Wait, could Chekhov have known that we were all in an anti-anti-joke?

"Let us suppose--hypothetically--that I, Ben Shapiro, were to walk into a bar.","This is already a red flag, as the premise is so overdone that even the act of making fun of it has become laughable. Besides, who's going to pay for it? Why would the taxpayer--who, make no mistake, does *not* see this as his best interest--have to be made to bow at a tyrannical government?A bar is a private business, and the bartender has a *constitutional right* to ask me about my long face! By the way, my wife (who is--you guessed it--a doctor) tells me there is nothing biologically wrong with my long face--and *yes*, there is such thing as biology, no matter how long the far left will keep denying it--but let's just say that for a year, no, *a month*, we magically get to apply Sander's socialist view of government--after all, what I tweeted nine years ago should bear very little importance to what I am now, especially since--supposedly--admittedly--we are here in a bar while out there some radical Islamist who, supposing--admitting--that I like my doctor like I like my coffee--wife--this might be the most ridiculous assumption I ever heard from the far left--is this a joke?

""It's quite foul, eh? Updog, that is. The smell of it. Of updog.""He sighed in disbelief at the foolish man that stood before him. Seven years he'd served in the investigative branch, hoping beyond hope that one day, some case would emerge among the countless obvious homicides that would pique his interest and be his and his only to solve. And for once, there it was, right in front of him—a true mystery at last. He'd even phoned up the owner of the place, to show how seriously he was going to take it. But alas, this clown served no use for him, and soon those thoughts of doubt came creeping again. The court would soon rule this a simple case of joint suicide before he would be assigned to yet another mundane murder.No, he thought. Not this time. He wasn't going to let anything impede his progress. He was going to put his all into this, no matter what. No more delays.""Okay, sir, thank you for your cooperation. We'll take it from here. Please stay at your hotel until the investigation is over.""""No problemo.""&nbsp;Mr. Thomson walked down the corridor, his yellow striped tie swinging with every step he took. It was clear to all the cops in the hallway that he had never suited up like this in his life, and to some degree they felt rather sorry for him. He smiled back at their lowered faces, holding his best impression of a clueless man as he passed by.The hotel they let him stay at was miles away, and though he certainly wasn't thrilled by the look of his house, he would much sooner run out the doors and back there than willingly be in the presence of those freaks again. But he'd been left with no choice; the walls were closing in on him, and he felt as though he would crack any moment. ""I want out,"" he whispered to the receptionist. ""Please.""She smiled at him blankly and handed him the key. Mr. Thomson sighed and went to the elevator, making sure to face away from the door, as he had been instructed.Sure enough, just one floor above him, that hooded man walked in. He couldn't see him, but he could tell from the distinct squeak of his glossy shoes who it was. ""You have done well, Roger."" He felt a stack of banknotes slide into his pocket.""Please, I… I don't want the money. I don't want nothing in this. Just please let him go.""""You will see your brother once you've outlived your importance."" He felt the hot breath come closer to his neck. ""And you are of great importance to us now.""He knew he was in no place to bargain, so he kept his mouth shut. The elevator stopped again, and the hooded man got ready to leave.""Wait,"" Mr. Thomson said, ""just for the record—what the hell is 'updog'?""A short silence followed, then a deep snigger. ""Wouldn't you like to know?"" The doors closed, and Mr. Thomson was once again left alone with his thoughts, that all hovered over his infinite abyss of despair.",52,AntiAntiJokes.csv

"""All the bars in Mobile are closed, Todd,"" Ewan said","""Man, fuck this town and fuck Alabama!"" Ewan shouted and kicked a can across the street. ""You know what we should do - drive all the way to Henderson.""""Sounds like a good idea. I ain't got no cash, though..."" Todd grinned sheepishly.""I got tons of cash. My aunt gave me $19,000 last week - we can gamble it all in Henderson,"" Ewan sighed deeply and dangled his truck keys in front of Todd's face.Hours later, the pair were nearing the Louisiana-Texas border. Todd was asleep and Ewan was driving now. The Buick's engine hummed loudly after the latest gas station stop.Ewan cursed and pulled over. He took out a cigarette and lit it up. He then walked away from the SUV and further into nearby fields.As he inhaled, he started to think of what he was going to do about Todd. As he stood there, looking up at the sunset - Todd snoring heavily back in the car and a cool breeze blowing softly - flashes of light in the sky to the northeast caught his eye.*Was it meteorites?* Ewan thought. As the objects got closer, hurtling towards Earth, Ewan began to run towards what he predicted to be the possible crash site.*Jesus, I could make the goddamn news!* Ewan thought excitedly.""Hey, Todd!"" He screamed back loudly as he ran. ""Wake up - you should see this!"" In all the excitement - as he raced towards the predicted impact spot of some of the objects - Ewan didn't see the hidden remnants of an old tree stump.Smack! Ewan's skull smashed into the pieces of rock lying next to the old tree stump. Blood gushed out of the gaping wound in his head. He had already immediately lost consciousness upon impact and with the rapid blood loss, Ewan King III, unemployed, of Mobile, Alabama - whose daddy used to be a cop but was now ""an oilman and dabbler of sorts"" and whose aunty, now a widow, was an old miserly millionairess, having survived her husband, a shipping tycoon born and raised in Atlanta Georgia - had only minutes to live, probably two at best.Seven and a half minutes later, the meteorites made impact 400 yards from the body of Ewan King III.Upon first sight, any observer would have remarked that a giant spider had crashed into Earth, but it would have quickly become apparent that the ""giant spider"" was in fact a spaceship of some kind.A loud hiss and doors opened as bright, blue light spilled out.From the spacecraft emerged a powerfully built male, naked, with bright blue hair and bright blue eyes, standing over 7 feet tall.

A portly man saunters into the Allport Taphouse,"He calls out to the barkeep and orders their darkest porter. As the barkeep pours his drink, she takes notice of him looking puzzled at the interior. Everything was rather ornate, too ornate for the small town of Riverport where the man lived. Portraits covered the walls depicting a vast variety of people of many time periods. The other patrons seemed equally as varied.""First time at Allport?"" the barkeep inquired with a slight grin as she handed him his glass.""Yup, strange place. You just opened up right?""""In your town, yes. We're known all over the world though. I'll give you the rundown of this place"" she lowered her voice to a whisper with her grin getting even wider. ""This is gonna sound pretty weir—""Just then the entire room shook as a tentacle burst through the front door sending splinters at alarming speeds across the room. In a flash the barkeep pulled a lever behind the bar lowering a portcullis stabbing through the tentacle, severing the limb. Several bright flashes followed by a hum of typewriters came from the opposite side of the room as all of this was happening. The man just stood there with his mouth agape not believing what he was seeing.""What the fuck is happening here?"" he finally said after a long drink from his glass.""Well, I was about to explain everything before something like this happened—tends to be a little easier on newcomers. We are no longer in Riverport. This Taphouse transports itself from port to port. Sometimes it travels as a ship"" she gestures at several portholes around the room through which he could see the crashing waves.""Other times it simply teleports to the next port. It's not really up to us, the Allport kinda has a mind of its own. Next stop is a port in Portugal"" she continued ""and if you wish to go back to where you came from at anytime simply enter the door at the end of the hall there and step through the portal.

"So, there was this Englishman, and an Irishman, and a Scotsman.","And they were all fighting in some war. And they got captured by the enemy. And the enemy accused them all of being spies, and said they were going to execute them by firing squad. So, the Englishman went up first. They stood him before a wall, they offered him a chance to speak to the padre, a final cigarette. When he was done, the soldiers all raised their rifles, and pointed them at him, and the captain began to give the orders for them to shoot. ‘Look out! Earthquake!’ shouted the Englishman, and the soldiers all turned around in alarm, and in the confusion the Englishman ran away. That’s a good idea, thought the Scotsman. He was taken to the wall. He was offered a padre, a cigarette. Now it was his turn to get shot. The firing squad aimed their guns. ‘Tornado!’ shouted out the Scotsman. The soldiers all whirled around, they didn’t want a tornado creeping up behind them, and the Scotsman managed to get away. This is easy, said the Irishman to himself. And if those two eejits can escape, then sure and begorrah I can too. He was calm as they led him to the wall. He had a casual chat with the padre, really savoured that final cigarette. He allowed himself a smile of anticipated triumph as the firing squad raised their guns. ‘Ready, aim—’ began the captain. The Irishman shouted, ‘Fire!’  When they were off duty, the Englishman, the Irishman and the Scotsman didn’t have much to say to each other. It wasn’t a big room, but over time they’d learned ways of keeping themselves to themselves. The Scotsman liked to sit at the table and play cards. He made no sound at all, save the soft flip-flip-flip as he turned them over and sorted them by suit. The Irishman lay on his bunk. There he might doze, or smoke, or drink, however the fancy took him. The Englishman often just sat on the floor and stared off into the middle distance. He called it meditation. The Scotsman and the Irishman both thought he looked ridiculous, but they never let on. They didn’t want to provoke an argument. They had enough of that in the act. Sometimes entire days would pass and they wouldn’t say a word. But it was perfectly genial, and they might exchange glances every now and then, and smile. The Englishman once told them he’d been with another troupe beforehand, and they’d wanted to spend all their free time rehearsing. Over and over again, this other Scotsman and this other Irishman, practising their patter, honing their routine. ‘I couldn’t stand it,’ said the Englishman. ‘Comedy’s got to have a certain spontaneity to it, right?’ His Scotsman and his Irishman agreed. Neither could remember a time when they’d performed with another Englishman, as far as they were concerned it had been the three of them in this tiny room forever. It annoyed them to think the Englishman had a bit of history they didn’t. But though they were fond of the Englishman, they knew the English were famous liars. He was probably just making it up. In the evening they took turns to cook. Roast beef and Yorkshire pudding. Haggis with tatties. Irish stew. They didn’t necessarily cook what you might expect them to cook; the Scotsman, for example, had a way with Irish stew, and the Englishman’s tatties were second to none. Their kitchen skills were quite varied, and in their private lives they sought to avoid cultural stereotyping as much as possible.  The Irishman didn’t much mind being the butt of all the jokes. What he resented was the unending predictability of them. The Englishman and the Scotsman might sometimes vary the routine; if they were doing the firing squad sketch, they might instead choose to shout out ‘Avalanche!’ or ‘Tsunami!’ Just to see how it sounded, they said, just to keep things fresh. The Irishman had no such freedom. You can fuck about with the setup, but a punchline is sacrosanct. Sometimes he would envy the Englishman and the Scotsman and their freewheeling improvisational ways, whilst he so laboriously had to stick to the script. Sometimes he would rather hate them. That said, he was always the one who got the laughs.  They were never given much notice. There’d be a knock at the door, just the one. It could be day or night. The Englishman, the Irishman and the Scotsman would stop whatever they were doing. The closest to the door would open it, and outside there’d be a box with their costumes in. The Englishman had a bowler hat, the Scotsman a tartan kilt, the Irishman was always dressed in muddy overalls and looked like a tramp.  They wouldn’t know which joke they were doing until they got out there. If they were in a desert, it’d be the car door sketch. If it were a construction site, the ham sandwich. Any sort of battlefield, really, if there were soldiers running about and shooting at each other and blowing themselves up, it’d probably turn into the firing squad sketch sooner or later. The firing squad always seemed very popular. Once in a while they’d get a jungle, and then it would be the canoe sketch. They all enjoyed the canoe sketch, the weather was so nice and warm. There was this Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman. And they were in the jungle. And they got caught by this jungle tribe. Real darkie savages, with bones through their noses, and the chief told them they were all going to die. But this wouldn’t be some pointless execution by firing squad, their deaths would be of valuable service to the tribe. The chief examined the Englishman, felt his skin. He said it was good skin, very tight, very strong. It would make heap good canoe. And he told the Englishman that the next morning he would be killed, and that his skin would be flayed from his dead body and turned into a canoe, but on his last night alive he could have whatever he desired. So the Englishman asked for a bottle of whisky, and a squaw he could have sex with. He was given the bottle, and a beautiful squaw led him to a teepee, and all night he drank and made wild love. And at sunrise he was taken out, his throat was slit, his skin cut off, and he was turned into a canoe. Pretty soon, though, the canoe went over a waterfall and was lost. So the chief went to the Scotsman and inspected him. He felt his skin, and said that it was very firm, very hairy, and just right to make heap good canoe. The Scotsman was allowed to have whatever he wanted. He chose five bottles of whisky, and hand-picked the five most beautiful squaws in the tribe. He went to the teepee. By sunrise he was already dead, but there was a big smile on his face. And his skin was cut off, and he was turned into a canoe. Pretty soon the canoe was lost, it went over a waterfall. So the chief went to the Irishman. He liked his skin. He said he could do great things with that skin. Coarse like hemp, when the Irishman’s skin was sliced from his body, when every little fleck of it was cut off the bone, and dried, and left to bake in the heat, it would make the heap finest canoe they had ever seen. The Irishman would be killed in the morning. But before he died, for his last night alive, he could have whatever he desired. The tribal barmen got the bottles of whisky ready, and all the squaws lined up in preparation. The Irishman asked for a fork. Nothing else – just a fork. The chief was puzzled, but agreed to grant his wish. They brought him a fork, and it was the best fork the tribe had, it was a golden fork and its tines gleamed in the sun. The Irishman took the fork. He held the fork up high, just for a moment, as if in reverence. And then, suddenly, he brought it down hard, and sank it into his leg. And faster, in a frenzy, stabbing hard all over his body, his arms, his bare chest, his face. And crying out, ‘Try to get me afloat now, you bastards!’ Actually, the Irishman didn’t enjoy the canoe sketch as much as his friends did.  Was it Heaven or Hell? They didn’t know. It was just where the dead would finish up. As something the living could laugh at. On Sundays – they liked to call it Sundays – the Englishman, the Irishman and the Scotsman were let out of their room, and could explore the courtyard, and meet the rest of the comedians. All the other Englishmen, Irishmen and Scotsmen – and Belgians too, and Polacks, and Canadians, and blacks, and cripples, and Jews. All the fat mother-in-laws, the doctors and patients, men walking into bars, and chickens in endless droves crossing roadways and never quite being sure what their intentions were in doing so. It was good to get out, there was always something to tickle the funny bone.  It had been an especially good gig. Or an especially bad one – either way, there was a present waiting for them on their doorstep the next morning. They couldn’t tell how old she was, they had no experience of little girls. She seemed frightened, she didn’t want to come in, and all three men had to back off until she dared put a foot over the threshold. She blinked at them, ready to run. Around her neck was a sign that said, ‘Your Daughter’. But whose daughter? There was no clue. She was beautiful. She hadn’t the sallow eyes of the Englishman, the red beard of the Scotsman, the Irishman’s skin as craggy as a cliff face. Oh, those eyes. Oh, that hair. ‘Maybe if she spoke to us,’ said the Englishman; ‘We’ll tell from the accent,’ said the Scotsman; ‘What’s your name, little darlin’?’ said the Irishman. And the girl opened her mouth, and she couldn’t answer them, her tongue had been ripped from her head. They didn’t know how to be fathers. They tried their very best. The Englishman taught the girl how to be prim and repressed. The Scotsman taught her how to be mean and angry. The Irishman taught her to be stupid. And they’d be on their best behaviour around her, they wouldn’t swear or fart or scratch at their balls. They’d play games with her, they’d make toys for her out of their few possessions. And in the evening, if she were a good girl, and she was always a good girl, they’d perform for her. They’d do their jokes, but with an eagerness that they’d never showed to the general public, their comedy was pure and true and so touching it even made them cry in spite of themselves. The girl wouldn’t cry. She’d giggle and clap her hands and each night when the jokes were over she’d give each of her three daddies a great big hug.  Comedy is, of course, subjective. What makes one person laughs leaves another stone cold. And the Englishman, the Irishman and the Scotsman all had different tastes. What the Englishman really liked was dry wit, and he had a particular liking for the aphorisms of Wilde and Shaw, and he would have happily entertained his colleagues with examples had they wanted him to do so. They didn’t. The Scotsman loved puns. He thought there was something inherently clever about a pun – the way that things had double meanings and were more complex than they first looked, because wasn’t that what life was like, really, wasn’t that just like life? From what he could remember – and sometimes in the night if it were dark or it were cold, he would reassure himself by counting in his head all the puns he had ever known, and there were fourteen. The Irishman liked pratfalls. So he liked to take the top bunk, and if he woke in the morning suddenly and forgot where he was, he might roll out of bed and tumble all the way to the ground. It gave him something of a thrill. They would have friendly arguments about the nature of comedy. The Englishman sided with the theories of Freud, and talked about the power of words set into a specific repeated system in order to elicit a response. The Scotsman sided with Kant, and said that comedy was all about dissonance, about the reversal of expectation even to the point of absurdism. The Irishman thought it was all about pointing at people and laughing when they got hurt. None of them thought the jokes they took part in were especially good. There was no class to them, no wordplay, not enough custard pie fights or falling down stairs. But they were still proud of the services they offered, they’d seen other Englishmen, Irishmen and Scotsmen out there, and they were up there with the best.  And their daughter liked what they did. Even when she was no longer an infant. Even when she became a teenager, and she was as tall as they were, and had grown breasts and curves. Even when she became a young woman, and was the most beautiful young woman any of them had ever seen. She still giggled, and clapped her hands, and hugged them – and she was there each time they came home from work, and it made everything worthwhile.  There was this Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman, and they shared a daughter that they loved with all their hearts. But they knew they couldn’t keep her forever, that one day she would leave. She’d have to go out into the world, and find a joke of her very own. She’d have to get married, and fast – women weren’t allowed to be in jokes unless they had a husband to nag. The Englishman, Irishman and the Scotsman all took turns to make their recommendations. The Englishman went first. He had a list of suitable English candidates as long as his arm. But when the time came, he couldn’t do it – he knew exactly what Englishmen were like, and he went pale at the thought that his beloved daughter would be saddled with a single one of them. Next was the Scotsman. The Scotsman opened his mouth to speak – but out came a sob, he couldn’t bear to lose his girl, no one Scottish was good enough to deserve her! Finally came the Irishman. The girl liked the Irishman, he always made her laugh the most of all, and she smiled because she knew he wouldn’t let her down. The Irishman said he had considered all the men in the world – not just the English, Scots and the Irish, but the Welsh too, and the Spanish, and the Greeks – he’d been around the courtyard looking for prospective suitors, and there wasn’t a man amongst them who was worthy. So he did the only thing he could, and married her to one of the chickens. After their daughter had left, they couldn’t stop thinking of her. It threw them quite off their stride. And the next time there was that one knock at the door, and they were summoned to do their act, they were in tatters. Their comic timing was off. The Englishman and the Scotsman went in the wrong order. The Irishman forgot what he was meant to say, and the firing squad was obliged to shoot him without a punchline. There was no laughter from the void. They went back home quiet, thoughtful, afraid. They’d all heard tales of what happened to jokes that stopped being funny. ‘We can’t talk about her,’ said the Englishman; ‘Never again,’ agreed the Scotsman; ‘For our own good,’ said the Irishman. They fell silent. The Scotsman sat at the table and played cards. The Irishman lay in bed and smoked. The Englishman squatted upon the ground and stared off into the middle distance, he didn’t stop staring for three whole days.  The Englishman would sometimes try to hang himself. So they’d all push the bunk beds away from the wall, so they could reach the light fittings – the Irishman would usually go up, he was the best with knots, and he’d tie the rope and let down a noose large enough to hold the Englishman’s fat head. The Englishman would ask the Scotsman and the Irishman to pull down on his legs to make his death cleaner; he’d get on the chair, and he’d say goodbye to them, and he’d kick the chair away. And the Scotsman would grab one leg, and the Irishman the other, and they’d pull with all their might, but no matter how hard they tried the Englishman’s neck would never break. And at last the Englishman would give up trying to choke, and he’d sigh, and sulk, and just stay up there twisting slowly from side to side. If he were particularly disappointed, he might stay in the noose for hours. The Scotsman and the Irishman hated it when he did that, it looked just as stupid as when he was meditating. So it was no surprise that the Englishman was the first to break ranks. ‘I’ve got another job,’ he told them one day. It turned out he’d been going to auditions secretly behind their backs. He’d got the part of the knock knock man. ‘You know the knock knock jokes, they’re huge,’ said the Englishman – ‘Chances are next time you tell one of those, you’ll be talking about me!’ He wouldn’t need his bowler hat any longer, he wasn’t an Englishman, he was an Everyman, he was to be the personification of everyone who has ever tried to gain admission through a door, regardless of age, creed or gender. On his last night in the room they had a farewell party. They drank wine and ate cake and they reminisced about the good old days when they were a team. All the old anecdotes came out – all of them, except the ones featuring their daughter. The Englishman got quite tearful: ‘I don’t want to leave you dear chaps, I’ve changed my mind, I want to stay here with you!’ But no one thought he really meant it. ‘I’ll invite you to my first night,’ he promised them, ‘I’ll get you in for free!’ The knock knock gig was one of the hottest tickets in town. They thanked him, they told him not to bother. The Scotsman and the Irishman continued their act alone. It still basically worked. They realised the Englishman had been a dead weight, all he’d done was to delay the pay-off. They told themselves the show was just as good as it had always been, and a bit quicker to boot. But they both knew that without the Englishman something was lost in the rhythm. And some nights out would come the whisky and the Guinness. ‘I miss the stuck-up bastard,’ the Scotsman would say. ‘Sure, b’jasus, I miss him too,’ the Irishman would reply. They received a postcard from the Englishman one day. It said, ‘Wish you were here’. And on the reverse side, no picture at all, nothing, no, not a thing.  One day the Scotsman admitted, ‘I’m not even really Scottish. I was born in Huddersfield.’ He remembered it all, he said. Where he was brought up. Where he went to school. What his parents looked like, his mother, his beautiful mam. He remembered the party he was thrown for his seventh birthday. His first job, why he was sacked from his first job, his second job. Meeting Annabelle. Marrying Annabelle. Her face, her lips, her eyes, her tongue. Annabelle. The Irishman asked if he remembered his own name as well. The Scotsman said, ‘No. No. No.’ He kept trying, but still the name wouldn’t come. ‘No. No. No. I don’t know who I am. I don’t know who I am.’ The Scotsman remembered how he’d died. He told the Irishman all about it. There was this Englishman, an Irishman, and a Scotsman. And they were captured by the enemy. And the enemy thought they were spies, and decided they would execute them. But they wouldn’t shoot them by firing squad, nor would they make canoes from their flayed skin. They would give them a chance. ‘Go into the forest,’ they said. ‘And each of you must return with ten pieces of fruit.’ And the men did so. ‘Now, if you can perform this task, we shall set you free. You must insert all of your fruit up your back passage in total silence. If you fail to insert every last piece of fruit, death. If you make a sound whilst doing so, death. If you hesitate, death. Begin.’ The Englishman had found ten apples. He was able to squeeze two Granny Smiths up between his cheeks, and though his eyes watered he held his tongue. But it was the Golden Delicious that did for him, no matter how hard he poked it in it just kept rolling back out again, and the effort made him wince with pain. ‘Your life is forfeit,’ they said, and they took him aside, and strangled him. Then it was the Scotsman’s turn. The Scotsman had picked ten blackberries. He bent over, spread his legs wide to give his anus the optimum width, and he began stuffing the blackberries up there one by one. He was doing so well. And then, on the eighth blackberry, the Scotsman could no longer help it, he burst out laughing. ‘Your life is forfeit,’ he was told, and, still giggling, he was taken aside and strangled. The Scotsman went up to Heaven. There the Englishman was waiting on a cloud. ‘What happened?’ asked the Englishman. ‘You seemed to be home and dry!’ ‘I know,’ said the Scotsman, ‘but I couldn’t stop thinking of that Irishman coming next with his pineapples.’ ‘And that’s how you died? For real?’ The Irishman thought this was all very spurious, but the Scotsman was sick now, he’d had to pause three times telling the story in order to cough up blood, and the Irishman didn’t think it was right to criticise. ‘Do you think it’s possible to die twice?’ croaked the Scotsman. He looked suddenly so small and frightened, because really, who knows what happens to us when our time is up? The Scotsman died, and the Irishman wept, and held him a wake, and drank all night in his honour. And before he went to bed he put outside all the empty bottles of whisky and the empty bottles of Guinness and the Scotsman’s corpse, ready for collection in the morning.  The Irishman was alone, and he felt alone too. If there was any part of his now forgotten life when he had ever experienced such loneliness, he was glad it was gone from his head, he didn’t want it back. He lay on his bunk, and dozed, and smoked and drank. But there was no fun in ignoring people when there was no one there to ignore. One day there was a knock at the door. The Irishman hadn’t thought he’d be wanted ever again. There was a costume waiting for him, his familiar dirty tramp outfit. He put it on, warily. No doubt he was to be teamed with another Englishman and another Scotsman, but they’d be strangers to him. He just hoped there’d be some natural chemistry between them. Comedy was no good without the chemistry. He went out on to the battlefield. He had been wrong. He had no new partners. He was now a solo act. There was this Irishman, and he was fighting in some war. Probably. And he got captured by the enemy. And the enemy thought he was a spy, and sentenced him to death by firing squad. And so that’s what they did – they shot him. There wasn’t much humour to be gleaned from that, the Irishman felt afterwards. The audience hadn’t even wanted him to say anything. There he’d been, all prepared to shout out the punchline, he’d got his cheesy grin all ready and had opened his mouth, but it was too late, the bullets tore him to pieces. He thought it’d be different the next time. It wasn’t. This was the new comedy. It didn’t want to waste time on setup, on delay, on delivery. It didn’t care about pace, charm or timing. Without the Englishman and the Scotsman to layer the gag, the joke could cut to the chase. The Irishman could come on, and they’d shoot him, or they’d flay his skin to make a canoe, or they’d stick pineapples up his arse. And the unseen crowds would laugh and stomp their feet and holler for more – and the Irishman couldn’t quite see what it was that so entertained them. He was just dying, where was the skill in that? He didn’t even have time to pull a funny face. Back in his room he’d rehearse. Try to adjust to the new act. He concentrated on the pratfalls he so loved, because he could at least be sure at some point there’d be a spot of falling over to be done. He devised amusing ways he could collapse in death. He tried his best. But the truth of it was, for all his hard work and preparation, in performance it never went the way he planned. The impact of the bullets burst his body open, and if it burst at an amusing angle it had really very little to do with him. Still, the Irishman was very popular. He got lots of bookings. There was this Irishman, and they shot him. There was a simplicity to that he supposed he should be proud of. As he stood before the firing squad, he knew he was dying for his country. It made him feel better somehow. It gave him an identity. Some days he went out to work with something of a swagger in his step. There was this Irishman, and he was captured, and put before the firing squad. They denied him the padre, they denied him the solace of a final cigarette. The soldiers all pointed their rifles at him, and the captain began to give the orders to shoot him, as he’d done so many countless times before. The Irishman looked out amongst his killers, and saw there a face he recognised. He stepped forward. ‘It’s all right,’ he said. Because she was so frightened. Maybe it was her first time. He didn’t know if she remembered him. He saw in her face all the primness the Englishman had taught her, all the meanness the Scotsman had made her practise hard. And he saw what he’d given her, that she was as thick as shit in the neck of a bottle. And, oh, she was beautiful, she’d been miscast, surely? She shouldn’t have been a killer. Those eyes, that hair.  Her rifle trembled as he approached. She tried to say something, her tongueless mouth opened and closed and opened again. ‘It’s all right,’ he said once more. ‘You’re doing fine, darlin’.’ He took hold of the rifle barrel, moved it so it pressed lightly against his throat. ‘I’m proud of you, and all the folks out there are proud of you. You’re going to be a star.’ He gave her a smile, and she managed a smile back, and he knew that it was all worth it, and there was not a laugh out there in the whole wide world that could spoil it. ‘Pull the trigger,’ he whispered. She did.",45,AntiAntiJokes.csv

I like my women like I like my coffee:,"Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as ""beans"") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world, and it can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte). It is usually served hot, although iced coffee is a popular alternative.Clinical studies indicate that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption reduces the risk of some diseases, although those long-term studies are generally of poor quality.",3,AntiAntiJokes.csv

My day with Bill Clinton,"When I entered Mr. Clinton's mansion, he zoomed through the dull pleasantries and immediately said he wanted to show me something. Something of the utmost importance. “I’m just here for our interview Mr.- “ “Listen, Ike”, Bill interrupted, assigning me a nickname I would continue to bear throughout the day, “I’m kind of a big fuckin’ deal, so you’re just gonna have to cool your god damn jets”. I couldn’t argue. This was perhaps the biggest interview of my career, so I followed without protest. The floors we were walking on were as ornate as the decor of the building. The black and white checkered marble tiling gave way to a gorgeous stucco wall covered in fine paintings and tapestries. The hallway alone looked like something out of Caligula's palace. To be fair, the scores of nude women who reclined on the expensive-looking furniture may have skewed my perception. Adorned upon the walls—which were already dripping with ivy wreaths and Ionian columns chiseled from the finest, whitest marble—was painting after painting. “This one’s a Rothko,” he said, noticing my preoccupation. He chuckled to himself as if he had just told me an extremely clever joke. “I’ve got a few more in my closet upstairs. C’mon, Hoss. We’re going that way anyhow.” We made our way to his room, and he kept pointing out vases and paintings. Saying they were from “the golden age of vasedom”, and “the neo-post-classical era of pastel”. I think he just made up terms to impress me. After what seemed like a two-hour tour of the portrait gallery led by someone who just started their art history elective, we finally arrived at a set of doors. I’m not sure why it struck me the way it did that the doors were so tall, but nevertheless I found myself almost impressed for the first time. Bill must have seen this in my face because he began prattling on about how they were aged oak doors. “The same kind they use for wine barrels.”He neglected to mention the “KEEP OUT” and “NO GIRLS ALLOWED” signs, hand-drawn on pieces of notebook paper. But they were taped on all the same. With great showmanship, he kicked the doors open like a cowboy bursting into a saloon. His room looked like it hadn’t changed since he was 17. There were posters on nearly every square inch of the walls and Cape Cod-style slanted ceiling, mostly for 80s rock bands. There was a large poster of Slash on the back of one of his doors, and above his racecar bed there was a huge Grateful Dead tapestry. “Welcome to the Pleasure Dome,” he said. Bill made his way to his closet, and I quickly said, “Oh, Mr. Clinton, I really don’t need to see your other Rothkoes, we should just get to the interview.”“Oh, yeah, the Rothkoes. That’s okay. We’ll get to those another day then. That’s not what I’m getting”. He rummaged around his closet, and in the bottom of a cardboard box, labeled “homework”, he pulled out a can of soda. He brought it back to the center of the room and took a seat in his beanbag chair. “Pop a squat!” he said, motioning to the egg-chair opposite his bean bag throne. I took a seat on the oval chair next to one of his train sets. As I was taking my seat, I noticed Bill unscrewing the top of his ersatz soda can and extracting a glass pipe and a grinder. “If my mom ever finds my weed, she’d totally freak,” he said. He began to pack the bowl, so I took out my recorder and set it down. At long last the interview could begin. “So, mister Clinton,” I said. “Your foundation is-”“C’mon man, hit this,” he said, trying to keep the smoke in as interrupted. I tried to tell him no, but he kept pushing. “This is really good weed, man. If you don’t hit this, you’re basically wasting it.” I told him I really didn’t want to get high right now but looked at me with a twinkle in his eye and said, “that’s okay, man, we’ll just get a little high.” He shot me a wink. We did not get just a little high. Every time the bowl emptied, I watched Bill produce more flower to pack it full again. Bowl after bowl was smoked, and somewhere around bowl number fourteen I begged him to stop. I could barely think straight, and it felt like my heart was going to beat out of my chest. “I didn’t know you were gonna be such a gay little pussy,” Bill Clinton said, ignoring my pleas and handing me the pipe for one more rip. I took a little puff, and Bill said, “you didn’t even inhale! What are you running for congress?” I sighed and allowed myself to enter Bill’s headspace. I laid back on his racecar bed as at long last he put away his herb and paraphernalia. “You wanna hear me play the saxophone?” Bill asked as he emerged from the closet empty-handed. I couldn’t remember how to talk, but he took my silence in the affirmative. He began rummaging through the trunk of his bed, and finally produced a set of VHS tapes. He put one in the TV across the room and turned the dial to channel 4. The tape was a recording of him on some late-night talk show campaigning for something. He was playing careless whisper. “Pretty sweet, huh”, he asked rhetorically. “Alright, I guess I’m ready to do your little interview or whatever.” Finally. I pulled out my recorder and found myself at a loss for words. My head was too clouded from Bill Clinton’s dank. “What, uh... So, do you think that… did the moon landing happen?” I heard myself ask. Bill chuckled to himself. “You know, Ike, the moon landing was just one of those things, you know? When they first let me into the White House, I asked the same thing, and do you know what they told me?” He looked at me for affirmation. I shrugged. He didn’t say anything, he just winked at me. I’m not sure I’ve seen anyone wink as much as Bill did. The talk show host was asking questions now, as Bill had finished playing for the crowd, so he stood up and turned off the TV. He sauntered over to a box and pulled out the Dark Side of the Moon album. He put it on his player. “Hey,” he said, barely holding in a chuckle. “Do you wanna hear about my newest art project?”With great effort, I managed a nod.“So, like, I’m gonna just shit. Shit all over a canvas, right? And then I’m gonna like, scrape it all around with a palette knife, and then,” he wheezed a laugh. “Then I’m gonna sell it at an auction, and the money is gonna go to the Clinton foundation!” He fell to the ground and laughed hard and long at his own joke. He wiped tears from his eyes. “Aw man. Bill Clinton cracks himself up.'' He was doubled over, laughing those hard, breathy laughs that only a man with leather lungs could muster. “But seriously man, check this out.” Bill began spinning the record backwards with his bare fingers. Pink Floyd blared through the speakers, backward and distorted. The haunting anti-melodies intruded my already clouded mind, and I saw great visions of vast deserts. At that very moment, Bill Clinton came to me in a vision. He towered over me, roaring saxophone notes into the dry, Coptic air. My body emerged from a great woven basket in the form of a snake as his hard-bop post-jazz aroused me from my slumber. I rose and rose, and Bill played louder and louder, and the notes turned into a message that I strained to hear. I yearned to understand what Bill was trying to tell me. I leaned my snake-body forward, craning my long back, aching to know Bill’s secret knowledge-“THERE IT IS!” he yelled. The music halted and I was lucid again. “Listen,” he said with the crazed intensity of a lunatic. Every word that came out of his mouth had the grave seriousness of a schizophrenic man telling you exactly how the world will end. “Listen really closely, Ike. This is where Roger Waters told me I was the Messiah. He told me that I will be a great ruler and bring peace to the kingdom of Israel in the great and terrifying end times. Do you hear it, man? Can you hear Roger’s guitar talking to me? He’s telling me, man. He’s telling me.”Bill had worked up quite a sweat. With every word he said his neck strained tighter. Every muscle in his face ached in a competition to see which one could contort hardest. The tendons in his neck strained hard enough that I thought they would burst from under his skin. “Man, it’s a good thing I didn’t listen when I was in the Oval Office… There wouldn’t be a fuckin’ Iran anymore, I can tell you that much. Shit, man. There wouldn’t be an England either. Her majesty Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of her other realms and- man FUCK you!” As he said this last part, he slammed his fist on the turntable, hard enough to split the record.“Aw, I’m sorry, man. No more Waters. I guess I turned Waters into whine, huh?” Again, Bill howled at his own joke. “C’mon, man. I’ve got one last thing I want you to see.”We left his room and went back down the grand, Corinthian staircase. As we walked, Bill produced a joint from behind his ear and lit it up. In two great sucks, it vanished to nothing but a filter. He flicked it haphazardly aside, and I noted the circular charcoal stain it left on the head of the priceless marble statue. It bounced off and rolled back down the hall before it finally stopped at Bill’s feet. One of his many women appeared to pick up the roach. Her bare feet pattered against the tile and she scurried directly in front of Mr. Clinton, cutting him off. “You bitch!” He roared. “Do you think Bill Clinton is paying you to get in his goddamn way?” The small, dark woman shrank into herself as Bill towered over her. Her naked body pushed further into the cold, hard floor, as she held her hands in front of her face. Mr. Clinton rose his great pale hand into the air.“What the hell is your name?'' he said, hand still poised for attack. “Juanita,” she said. “No, it isn’t! In Bill Clinton’s house, only Bill has a name! Do you understand?”Her voice was small and squeaky. “I’m so sorry Mr. Clinton, sir. It will not happen again. Please, Mr. Clinton sir, please don’t hurt me”. “Aww hell,'' he finally said. “Make yourself useful and pick up the roach. It won’t be the only butt you get to pinch today.” He prodded me with his elbow and winked for the umpteenth time. “We like to have fun around here,'' he said. “Don’t put this in your story.”As we rounded the final corner, a flock of maids skittered away like roaches. Behind them, the entrance to a great open room. Inside, vines twisted over us like great verdant rafters, rocked by zephyrs that curled between looming Grecian columns. “I like to come here when I want to have a big ole think,” said Bill. He rubbed his chin, and stood for a while in pensive silence. We watched the wind sway the vines, and the birds in the trees. Finally, Bill broke the silence.“I keep having this dream, man. I’m in a forest, and I’m surrounded by tribesman—you know the type. Big boys with some meat on ‘em. The kinda fellas who you just know are looking to eat either you or your horse, depending on what kinda day they’ve had? Hell, that’s the only reason I gave those Chayannese boys their eagle feathers, who knows who they would’ve eaten?” He sparked another joint and took a long drag.“But I’m in these woods, surrounded by these fellas, and Ike, believe me when I tell you they are mean. They look at me like I am just the worst president in the whole wide world, and suddenly their head honcho, or chief, or morubixaba—I think they’re Tupi—comes over and says something like ‘ongo bongo welcome to our jongle,’ and I’m not gonna look a warrior like that in the eye and say no! But I guess he doesn’t know that, or he sees that I’m not really into it, so he gives his men some sort of look and they tie me up and drag me off and we go down this long and winding path.“For hours, man, we’re just trudging deeper and deeper into the humid darkness, and off deep in the trees along the path, I swear I see something. But the longer I look out into the darkness of the canopy or whatever they call it, the more I think there’s nothing there at all and all the while, these boys keep dragging me into the thick of it. And the sounds, Ike, they’re like nothing you could believe. I’ve only heard the birds here in the U. S. of A. and maybe a few of the socialist ones, and maybe some monarchical ones in the sandier regions back during my reign, but man, these birds! They make the strangest sounds. It’s like a buzz and a whine, and a few pops—I can’t describe it right, but you’ve just gotta believe me on this, no one has ever heard these sounds outside of the furthest depths of the Amazonian jungle. “So, these bird sounds keep getting stranger and stranger, and the path gets more clear, and suddenly, we’re back in a village full of tribal women and children. All around me I hear people and birds chittering, and the tribesmen keep pulling me and take me to this massive, Texas-sized wigwam, and inside is the oldest man I’ve ever seen. This wrinkled old glove-face Indian is just sitting there, lit up by the fire he’s stirring, and without looking up he motions for me to come in.“‘Welcome back,’ he says, and man, I wish I could remember if he said that the first dream. But before I can get to thinking too long about what he means, he says ‘Ole Bill, now I’m gonna tell you something important, so listen up.’ He says, ‘you’ve been chosen, and I don’t just mean to save America. You’ve been chosen to save the whole world.’ Now of course, I’m a little taken aback by this. I mean, you know me, I already know I’m the Messiah and all, but this Indian seems to think I’ve been chosen for something even more important. Now, the Indian starts loading up a long pipe with some pretty stank-ass vegetable matter, if you catch my drift, Ike. Then he tells me, ‘try not to forget what I’m about to tell you.’ He takes a long drag of his long pipe, he holds it in, then he blows it out into my face. Now, I don’t know Indian culture and etiquette, but I do know normal etiquette, and that’s just not a very kind thing to do in Arkansas, so I start to yell at him. Well, I try, but as soon as I open my mouth, I find I can’t.“Suddenly, my whole body is made of wood and I’m like this giant ungahari tree. For some reason, I know I’ve been watching over these people for eons. My mind is flooded with the secrets of the galaxy, and the universe and stuff. And it’s all flowing in from the earth mother down below, up through my roots, like I’m the universe’s knowledge antenna. And I’m so totally discombobulated that I just have to wake up and recombobulate myself, or the whole universe will disappear! At which point, I of course find I cannot. It’s not until I give in and allow myself to live the life of every human being who has ever lived that I can finally rest. I just have to sit there and endure every act of evil and kindness that ever has and ever will occur, all while these Indians strip away my bark to roll fat-ass blunts with. Are you still following, Ike? Because this is when it starts getting really good.“So once I finish living every life, and having every single human emotion—and by the way, did you know that happiness in the ‘30s feels different than it does now? And that sadness in the Roman Empire was a vastly different sensation than it is right now, but in the future, it becomes the same again? Never mind, it doesn’t matter. So, the earth mother comes to me in the form of a leopard. Like, the spirit of the earth itself, just sitting there in a leopard body. I know she’s the earth mother, and she knows I’m Bill Clinton. But at this point, I’ve entirely forgotten the concept of self, because of the whole living everyone’s life bit. But she says to me, ‘now do you understand?’ Ike, she’s so kind about it too. She gently paws a little bug off of my root that was squirming around and tickling me, and I tell her, ‘I don’t know,’ because I don’t know. Now, I don’t think leopards can smile, but Gia does, and she says, ‘that’s okay little one, you don’t need to. Just don’t forget what we’ve shown you.’ and then, finally, I wake up.”Bill stared at me for a long time. He was out of breath. I was still pretty high, so I was having some trouble remembering all of the details of his story, but my tape recorder got it. “Sounds like a crazy dream, man,” I said. I wished he would stop looking at me with his crazed, red eyes. “No, man. That was no dream,” he said. “That was the real world. What were in right now, that’s the dream,” he said. “Weren’t you listening to anything I said, man? That’s the real world! I’ve lived your life a thousand times, and I’ve lived mine a thousand. We’ve had this entire conversation a thousand times! I know you better than you know yourself, and I know with certainty what’s going to happen in the world we’ll leave behind.” He threw a piece of gravel through one of the windows in the ceiling of his arboretum and screamed. “I am everyone, everyone is me! Don’t you get it? Don’t you understand anything? Why are you asking me questions about the damn Clinton Foundation? You should be asking me about why I, the god that created this very universe, picked Pi exactly the way I did! Why did I, your creator, make Hydrogen the way I made it! Why did I pick the gravitational constant in such a way that you could exist? Aren’t you even a little curious?” Bill was beginning to worry me, so I started backing away. “Aww heck,” he said. “I’m just teasin’, Ike.” He clapped me on the back. “But don’t forget, I’ve already lived your life a thousand times, so I know what you’re going to say about me. I don’t mind. Don’t bother sending me a review copy, just publish what you’re going to publish.” I all but ran out of the room, past his harem, to the front door. Before I could get it open, Bill put his hand on it, holding it closed. “Ike,” he said. ""Just one thing I don't want you to mention in your story."" He glared at me, returning to his snake form, filling the room with his serpentine presence and the foul, olfactory symphony of death. I was but a cockroach standing before the god that was Bill Clinton as he hissed and swung his enormous body up through the glass ceiling, shattering it, just like Hillary. He swooped back down, inches from me and spoke in a slow, melodic voice. ""When you mention my bed"", he hissed, eyes beginning to glow red. ""Lie about the wheels.""",75,AntiAntiJokes.csv

How did the horse not previously notice this? And why is the horse talking? Horses can’t talk.” “That’s because none of this is actually happening.” said the bartender “This is all just a bad joke being posted in r/antiantijokes.” “Wait a minute, you mean all of my life is an illusion?” Gay the horse says.

A gown man ate an entire pie in his car,"As he wiped the bits of leftover pie off his face, dabbing the collar of his shirt against his lips to remove the purple stains, he heard a tapping at his window, looking over to see a police officer standing outside. Rolling down the window he gave the officer a nod, placing the empty tray aside. “Morning officer, are you having a peachy day?”“I’m fine, I just got called to check out a suspicious individual. The reports said you were licking the crust of a pie, talking about how you would destroy it once you got into the car. As you can expect a lot of people were concerned with your comments.”“Concerned enough to call the cops? Look, it was just a bit of fun, I did destroy the pie too, see that empty tray next to me? I did that, just dug in and destroyed that pie. It was delicious. As you can see officer, there’s nothing weird, I was just enjoying a snack.”“A snack? You ate a whole pie as a snack?” The officer leaned down towards his chest, whispering into his phone. “Yeah, going to need back up, there’s a freak eating pie in his car.”“Psst, eating pie? I’m sure you can handle that?” The voice on the phone seemed less than thrilled by the officer's concerns, nearly hanging up, only for the officer to say something that got his attention.“He ate the entire thing in his car. This isn’t a normal guy.” The officer must have thought he was being quiet, giving the man a reassuring thumbs up as he listened to the conversation.“The entire thing? Was he at least crying? Maybe he was having a breakdown?” The voice tried to be rational, tried to think of a way to justify the threat, but there was none.The officer leaned closer to him, dragging his tongue along the man’s eyelid, rolling his tongue back into his mouth before responding to the phone. “Not even an ounce of salt on his eyes.”“Stay safe, I’m calling in the big guns.” The phone buzzed off as the officer freed his gun from its restraint. “Ok, hands in the air, I need you to step out of the vehicle.”Still being mentally disturbed by the lick, the man panicked, throwing his arms up only to realize that he couldn’t leave the car with his hands up. “Can you.... Open the door for me? My hands are in the air.” As soon as the man finished the sentence, a bullet fired at the car, knocking off his side mirror. Dropping his arms down, he did what any sane person would do. Stomped on the accelerator and fled, having to duck as a spray of bullets followed his escape.The man could hear the cop screaming at him as he exited the parking lot. “YOU BETTER RUN YOU FREE THINKER!” As the cop said that, it was like the man had a moment of clarity. He was an adult, he could do whatever he wanted. Mortal restraints could not bind him. The man pushed open the car door, leaping out of the moving vehicle. Instead of rolling down the road, he instead floated, hovering above the floor. The cars moving past him seemed slower, allowing him to sidestep the oncoming traffic. He had reached enlightenment.He could hear tugging tanks on the horizon, each drawing near with their weapons facing him. Their weapons couldn’t hurt him. Anything that was shot his way just vanished, he was a God, the pie God. ...at least he *was* until a blackness consumed him, waking up on a hospital bed, a few concerned nurses staring down at him.“Oh, you're awake? You passed out after choking on a handful of pie. Why were you even eating pie in a carpark weirdo? Not that it matters, I’m just glad that you woke up from that nightmare, you wouldn’t stop making weird noises, a few of the other nurses really thought you would die.”The man didn’t know how to respond to that; it had all felt so real. “Sorry” Was all he could mumble, the nurse giving him a nod before leaving to recover. Beside the man sat the half-eaten pie, still in its beautiful silver tin. Well, one more bite wouldn’t hurt.",3,AntiAntiJokes.csv

A man misses his wife,"“Oh how I’ve missed my wife!” came the wail from the man at the bar next to me. He repeated the refrain in various forms while taking long gulps from his drink, causing me to question the choice of this uncomfortable seat I had picked. “She moved so quickly! It caused me to miss her so!” His eyes rolled like a horse, the man was clearly a lunatic, albeit with a charming love of his wife. The chair squeaked again. Definitely a poor choice.“Always darting here and there!” he cried, and he began gesturing wildly. His arms raised, I saw in his belt was a revolver. Now I saw the danger in this man. I tried to scoot away, but the chair would have none of it. “Breaking news update” came the sound from the TV at the bar. “Deranged man on the loose after attempted homicide. Please be cautious and stay indoors.” Now I turned to the man to see him waving the gun, shouting “Wife! Wife! Wife!” over and over. I tried to get up but the chair confounded me again. My head snapped this way and that around the bar but no one looked over, as if by ignoring the man he wouldn’t be real to them. I tried to disengage from the chair but my hip was caught. But lo, police came in! As I saw them enter through the door I pointed at the man and shouted “ There! That’s the man you want!” But they both scurried over to me and gripped roughly under my arms. “No, not me!” I protested. “That man!”“Sir, stop resisting.” Said the man to my right. “That’s a chair.” “And please, try to be decent! You’re in public!” Said the man to my left.But I couldn’t hear them over the shouts of the crazy man and my laborious sex with the chair.",8,AntiAntiJokes.csv

Except they aren’t rocks, they are ice cubes.‘I think I want a divorce.’ exclaimed the rabbi.‘What? Why? What did I do wrong?’ the priest shrilledFoolish priest. You never got married what are you talking about.You see, these religious figures had been friends  for all their life, fulfilling the same, mundane day-to-day routines. Going to the same old bar with the same old drinks. It seemed it be enough for them. ‘I’m going to have to cut you off you have had too many drinks, sir.’ said the bartender to the priest.‘What? This is my first and only drink?’The priest gazed upon the sullen beauty of the waxy-faced bartender. Years of mental torment reflected in his eyes.That’s when a horse made its way inside, presumably sheltering from the rain. At least I think it’s raining. I like to think so. It could just be the sound of the air-conditioning. It is rather cold in here. It’s always felt cold since my wife left me for the Egyptian dentist that lives next door. Did you know that ancient Egyptians used crushed mice brains as toothpaste? Neither did i. Fascinating isn’t it. Please Sharon come back I miss you so much.That’s when the bartender looked at the horse and snarled ‘Why the long face?’ ‘I’m so sick of your shit, Gilbert.’ The horse turned and walked out, like Sharon. Please Sharon.The rabbi whipped out his fidget spinner to distract himself from the immense tension in the room. Leaving his wife meant he would only have the priest in his life. He is all he’ll have left.‘I am going to lay out a scenario for you. You have two doors, two paths to take. Two options. One consists of fulfilling the next phase in your life. A life without your wife. The other you keep your wife, but lose the priest. Whichever you choose, I’m sure the other will be in your heart forever.’ The rabbi stared at the priest. A life without him? He couldn’t. Never.‘I know what I have to do.’ shouted the priest as he arose from his seat. He flees the scene.‘My oh my is that the time already?’ Said the bartender. He ripped off his uniform revealing the sexy burlesque costume underneath.The rabbi gazed upon the stars (I knew it wasn’t raining I just lied earlier). Staring at the moon he knew that the priest would always be there for him. A lifelong friendship. Beautiful isn’t it. An unbroken bond to last a century.‘Dude, where’s my car?’ cried the rabbi.

It's an epithet, which means an adjective or phrase expressing a quality or attribute regarded as characteristic of the person or thing mentioned. Get it?""The caporegime retorts: ""What a fuckin' crock, that doesn't make any sense. Since when has telling on someone been a known characteristic of rats? A rat can not speak either. That's bullshit!""The man replies: ""Jesus, Carmine. Again, no offense but why in the fuck would the police possessing all this information on us be a result of us havin' an actual rodent in our crew?!

A housefly walks into a bar,"and the bartender says, “Why the long face?” To which the housefly responds, “I’m a housefly not a horsefly.” It’s at this moment when an old man bursts through the door and frantically runs straight into the restroom. The housefly and the bartender look at each other in amazement and continue to stare deep, deep into each other’s eyes. After a minute or two, and halfway through the sad song playing from the jukebox in the corner, he asks the housefly, “I’m sorry, what did you say your name was?” The housefly leans in slowly right up to the bartender’s ear and says, “Your ride is here.” The bartender jolts awake in a panic, quickly realizing he is not only not a bartender but rather an adolescent who nodded off briefly in the front entrance of his high school after senior prom during which none of the pretty girls asked him to dance. “Your ride is here,” the principal says once again. The young man’s mind is racing, still hazy with remnants of the most bizarre dream he’s ever had. He is suddenly overcome with emotion as he notices on the principal’s jacket is a lapel pin in the shape of a housefly. He stands up from the bench upon which he dreamt, his legs wobbly, and asks, “How long had I been dreaming?” The principal again responds, “Your ride is here.” The young man now finds it peculiar that the only words the principal has said are “Your ride is here” and nothing else. He gently, but with some force, taps the principal’s shoulder above the fly-shaped pin, realizing now that the principal is just a cardboard cutout with an electric speaker programmed to only say that phrase which he can’t bare to hear again. He smashes the false, paper principal and runs into the dark auditorium to find his friends and find out just what the hell is going on. To his utter shock, when he opens the heavy double doors to the auditorium he realizes he has just entered a bar. The bartender is talking to the only patron, a housefly.

"""Looks like this is a bridge over *troubled water*""","God was bored.Ignoring people's fervent prayers used to be a full-time job but lately it's been lackluster and unfulfilling. Not only are people praying less, but the thing they pray for are the same pleas he's heard for thousands of years. Peace, prosperity and goodwill. Who do they think He is?Deciding it was time for another jaunt 'downstairs', he once again takes form and goes for a walk in the woods. He listens to the birds, the trees and the rocks, every atom speaking to him in a language only he can understand. As He walks, He comes across a young woman. They fall in step and begin to talk. As they cross a bridge, He says [INSERT TITLE HERE], hoping to impress her with His wit.The girl looks at Him askance, clearly not getting the reference.Suddenly afraid of being seen as a dreaded boomer, He stammers and says ""It's, like, all the damage we do to the earth eventually hurts the water, which is what sustains us all. The water loves us but it can't help hurting us, which troubles it.""The girl decides He's emo, which is only marginally better than being a boomer and begs off.God fucks her anyways because if you read the Bible you know He doesn't give a Himselfdamned care about consent.Nine months later, she gives birth to the Anti-Christ.Nineteen years later, he comes into his power and the destruction of earth begins. Demons flood the earth. Flesh is torn from bodies in a flurry of blood and gore as they have their fill of all the unsaved and the earth burns, and burns, and burns.",70,AntiAntiJokes.csv

""Going to the store to buy more diapers are we, Steven?""Steven indignantly retorts: ""The diapers are for my son! Leave me alone, you assholes!""One of the seagulls laugh and reply: ""Oh, suuure Steven, they're for one of your adult sons. You giant mouthbreathing freak, you're not fooling anyone.""Another seagull remarks: ""Hey, why don't you tell us all about ""the kick"" that you ""invented"" for Anderson Silva. You pathological liar, you. Haha!""Steven starts to become enraged and breathes heavily as he stops pacing forwards. He looks up at he seagulls with a sneer on his face and clenched fists.""Careful now, Steven, before you shit your pants again."" One seagulls yell jeeringly.""Don't make me come up there you feathery fucking hyenas!"" Steven yells as he stomps and flails his arms around rabidly. His unhinged demeanour attracts a bystander, who approaches Steven who is now foaming at the mouth and pelting the seagulls with rocks.The bystander asks Steven: ""Sir, are you alright?""Steven replies: ""These seagulls have been harassing me for several weeks! Call the police!""""Uhh, okay?"" The bystander says before looking up at the seagulls. The only sounds audible to him are the regular calls of seagulls. ""Wuaah! Wuaah! Wuaah!""""No! That's just a rumor! I've never sexually assaulted anyone!"" Steven yells back.""Wuaah! Wuaah!"" Another seagull utters.Steven replies again: ""Bullshit! It's true! Why would I make something like that up?! I'm friends with the pope as well!""The bystander pats Steven's shoulder and says hesitantly: ""H-holy shit, okay. Let's calm it down, big guy, huh? Take a deep breath and find your happy place.""One of the seagulls have managed to attach a piece of black string to the back of its head, mimicking a ponytail. Steven points at the seagull as it struts around on the pavement and yells: ""Look, look! It's making fun of me! I don't sound like that, motherfucker!""The bystander eventually calls an ambulance and after Steven describes the meticulous harassment and bullying from the seagulls that has spanned several weeks to the EMT's, Steven is admitted for inpatient care at a reknowned mental institution for celebrities and other high profile individuals.

He initially denies their claims but after many painstaking hours of treatment, Steven becomes agreeable. He is finally released 6 months later and is greeted by his family outside.At the first sight of seagulls at the institution's parking lot, Steven becomes nervous, anticipating more verbal abuse, yet all he hears are the normal calls of seagulls.

A human walks into a bar and breathes oxygen,"Suddenly, all the atoms in the bar turn into protons, and the bar which used to consist of half protons and half electrons collapses into itself and becomes a black hole.Bartender: ""LOL. I never guessed THAT would be the way I go.""Now you may wonder how is it possible that the bartender even reacted to this event given that all the atoms in his body have just turned into protons. You would be right of course, but actually this sentence was said in the past, in the evening two days before.What happened then (two days before) was that the another human being had just entered the bar (also one which breathes oxygen). As she approached the bar, she raised her gun, pointed at the bartender and said: ""Give me all your money, or else I would shoot you in the face!""What I said the bartender said earlier was his response to this young lady. In fact, he was never quite good in social situations. He did not understand that laughing at people threatening to shoot him was probably not going to end well. Maybe that's why he always used to feel so isolated at school, and which was why he decided to become a bartender in the first place. A vicious cycle indeed. That evening would prove to be his greatest mistake.On the other hand, there is no absolute concept of time, since time is relative. The gravitational pull of the black hole slows down time near it, so this was only two days in the future from the point of view of a very distant point in the galaxy. Near the bar which has instantly became a black hole, only a moment has passed and both of the bartender and the human being which breathes oxygen instantly become a bunch of protons.A day later, two nights walk past the bar.""We need a room for two knights, please""",97,AntiAntiJokes.csv

An Arab walks into a bar,"It is said by men worthy of belief (though Allah’s knowledge is greater) that in the first days there was a bartender who called together his architects and his priests and bade them build him a sports bar so confused and so subtle that the most prudent men would not venture to enter it, and those who did would lose their way. Most unseemly was the edifice that resulted, for it is the prerogative of God, not man, to strike confusion and inspire wonder. In time there came to the bar a king of Arabs, and the bartender (to muck the simplicity of his guest) bade him enter the labyrinth, where the king of Arabs wandered, humiliated and confused, until the coming of the evening, when he implored God’s aid and found the door. His lips offered no complaint, though he said to the bartender that in his land he had another labyrinth, and Allah willing, he would see that someday the bartender made its acquaintance. Then he returned to Arabia with his captains and his wardens and he wreaked such havoc upon the sports bar, and with such great blessing by fortune, that he brought low his stools, crushed his pool table, and took the bartender himself captive. He tied him atop a swift-footed camel and led him into the desert. Three days they rode, and then he said to him, “O king of time and substance and cipher of the century! In your sports bar didst thou attempt to make me lose my way in a labyrinth of brass with many stairways, doors, and walls; now the Powerful One has seen fit to allow me to show thee mine, which has no stairways to climb, nor walls to impede thy passage.”Then he untied the bonds of the bartender and abandoned him in the middle of the desert, where he died of hunger and thirst. This was mostly a short story by Jorge Luis Borges. I changed all mentions of the King of Babylonia to a bartender and of Babylonia to a sports bar to justify a title that would sound like a joke. The rest up until this paragraph is the short story verbatim. Some would even say this isn't an anti-anti-joke (though Allah’s knowledge is greater).

The bartender did not ask.The man didn't smile. ""I could tell you but then I would have to kill you.""That sentence was actually spoken.

I can't believe you bozos fell for that again! Wheew! I'm on a roll over here!""The elderly man, now visibly disgruntled, says to the boy: ""You little prick. A century from now people will still be sharing folk tales of the Boy Who Cried Wolf and the phrase will be an idiom for signalling false emergencies and the dire consequences that follow such behaviour! Mark my words, boy. You'll be a story of foolishness and embarassement that will be forever passed on throughout the annals of history.""The boy retorts: ""Pfft! That was quite a speech, gramps.

Life is shit anyway."" The mother duck says.""Yeah, wow! Thanks for killing all our siblings, dude. You're truly fucking remarkable behind the wheel. Have you considered racing for Formula 1?""

It can't be!""The mother duck rolls her eyes and says: ""Holy shit, you truly are some kind of savant aren't you? Terrible hand-to-eye coordination and mentally handicapped, yet incredibly observant.

That the NBA is mostly comprised of black players?!""The man, having regained his composure and accepted the novelty of talking ducks becomes irritated at them. He says: ""When you're all done with this little circle jerk of yours, I'll have you know that you were the ones being reckless by absentmindedly walking into my path.

Yes, I'm at the scene of a car accident. You're going to need two ambulances because me and my entire family are in shock and disbelief that such a skillful driver would fail so miserably!""

The mother duck feigns suprise and says: ""Oh my god! You are absolutely correct! What was I thinking?! Edoiiii! I'm so silly today.""The man slowly starts to succumb to his wounds as his final moment is accompanied by an increasingly distant ambiance of ducks quacking in mocking tones.

Is life just a dream?The man is about to die as one of the ducklings hop into the vehicle and says to him: ""Scoot over, moron. I've always wanted to test drive one of these.

I will do no such thing! HAH! In fact, watch me do the opposite of everything you just said!"" The man runs his hands along the bar counter, starting from one side to the opposite end.

""Noone tells me what to d-.."" is all what the contrarian manages to say in return before he's grabbed by the shoulders and forced outside by the bartender.

The first time i lied to my dad,"Is the only time i lied to him. Ever. Because he is a person that values honesty. So when i told him a lie he said to me - ""Son. I know you told me a lie. Don't ever lie to me again, because i value honesty."" So anytime i want to tell him a lie now i instead tell him an honesty.My father accepts honesties. He rewards me for being honest. For example, when i say something honest, he says - ""Son, i'm very proud of you for telling me this honesty, so i reward you now, thank you.""My mother once caught us in the middle of the reward ceremony. ""What is this ceremony!"" she proclaimed vigorously. My dad honestly replied ""I give son reward for telling me honesty!"" Mom said - ""Honey he's a liar, he tricked you into believing that he was honest, but in reality he was lying."" Father was heartbroken, he screamed - ""Liar!"" and went back into his room. I told mom - ""Why did you have to stop ceremony? I like reward ceremonies."" But mom replied - ""Son, your dad is an idiot, honesty doesn't get you anywhere in this world. Look at me, i married your father, achieved everything in my life through lies, and in comparison your father was tricked into marriage by me and all he ever got from anyone is lies. Look, i lied to him that you lied to him and he started crying in his room. He is a loser, don't be like him. Start lying, my boy.""And so i started lying. I mostly lied to my dad but also to my mom sometimes. I lied to my dad about telling him honesties. He would always smile when i told him an ""honesty"" and really thought it were real honesties, i was not a little kid anymore so my lies were of higher quality than those which i could produce when i was younger. He had his suspicions but he always chose to buy the ""honesties"" because that saved his emotional state. My mom always knew when i told her lies because she was a better liar, but she always rewarded me for trying so that i have stimuli to lie more. Once i tried telling her an honesty and she screamed at me so loud that dad ran to us asking ""Why are you shouting at our son?"" She told him that i was telling lies so father said ""I'm very disappointed in you, no reward ceremonies for you for the entire month!"" I was very upset about it and learned that it was best to keep lying to satisfy both mom and dad.Sometime later, when i was getting older, my dad decided that he was dying, and he was honest about it - he said ""Son, wife, i'm going to die."" I told him ""I'm very sorry dad, i will miss you."" It was an ""honesty"". I was very sad that it couldn't be an honesty, but after telling him ""honesties"" for so many years i couldn't just break this habit and disappoint both mom and dad again. My dad said that he is proud to have raised such an honest son. Then he died. My mother then said ""Son, i'm going to die as well."" Then i didn't know how to reply, it suddenly was so complicated. Obviously, it was a lie, but what kind of lie should i tell her? But before i could come up with a reply, she continued - ""Your father is dead."" ""No he isn't!"" i told her! ""You are going to be dead too!"" - ""Yes i am!""This conversation continued in this manner until mom died. ""So wait, she didn't lie?""Obviously she lied about being a liar.Now i'm worried if i'm going to die or not.",4,AntiAntiJokes.csv

Everybody turns around stunned. Jesus Christ stops talking and frowns, shocked given that he has never been interrupted before.The tall black warrior roars again in laughter, his powerful thick arms resting proudly on his waist.""Rubbish!""

He screams at the powerful black warrior standing below. His voice can be heard for miles; it is like the sound of booming thunder, deafening, terrifying and ferocious. ""You dare to disrespect the Son of God?! You - a mere mortal?!""The warrior stares up, terrified and speechless.Jesus, now visibly calm with no frown, smiles.The powerful winged blond angel swoops down and lunges at the warrior.""For your pride and rudeness, mortal, you will now be shrunk down and made to wander this Earth for four thousand generations!

When your fellow mortals go to the stars in the future and see the wonders of God and His creation, you will be left to rot on this rock forever! Thus I have spoken! Now be gone!""With that, the black warrior begins to shrink visibly before everybody. His powerful thick arms and legs shrink and become thin and bony. His large curly hair becomes lifeless and small. His beard disappears. His powerful aesthetic face shrinks into a puffy unsightly ugliness. He is now a head and a half shorter than before and resembles a thin young boy. The crowds laughs, stunned and in awe.Jesus Christ grins and calms the crowd.The former powerful warrior, with sad and terrified eyes, scurries away from the square, ashamed and frightened.Jesus grins at the crowd.""I am Jesus Christ and I am the son of God.""",94,AntiAntiJokes.csv

A 7'3 man walks into a bar with his 6'8 12 year old son,"""What are you fellas drinking?"" The elderly barman asks.""Carlsberg for me and a diet cola for the boy. He's got practice tomorrow."" The man replies.""No problemo."" The barman turns around. ""You got any ID, bud?"""" He says, back turned.""What? For a coke? You're kidding, right?"" The 12 year old says.""No. I was talking to you."" The barman points to the man.""Oh."" The man shows his ID.""25, huh?"" The barman smiles up at the man.""Yup. And Tristan here is 12. Got a college sophomore pregnant when I was just 13 myself. Bad decisions. She got arrested, went to jail and my parents adopted the kid. Graduated from college a few years back and I'm now his legal parent.""""I...see. Do you ever wish you could go back and change things?"" The barman asks.""No! Of course not! Tristan's a cool kid. And I'm sorry I ruined Tilly's life - woman I got pregnant - but things happen for a reason."" The man replies, now sipping his cold beer.""You do realize that I'm an antigenie, right?"" The barman grins.""What? The hell is that?!"" The man says.At that point, the barman suddenly transforms into a very dark-skinned clone of Tom Jones and begins singing the hit single ""It's Not Unusual"", with music blaring out from the bar's speakers.The 25 year old is then whisked back in time to UC Berkeley's campus and is 13 years old again and he sees Tilly the college sophomore but pushes her off of him before they have sex and runs back home. Decades later, he is now a homeless man begging for change in a rundown quarantined Sacramento whilst Tilly the sophomore is known by millions of Americans as President Matilda Ibrahim Jefferson Washington III, ""the President holding America together"".Tristan, the 6'8 12 year old is not born, although thousands of miles away, in a small town 20 miles south of Paris, France is a 23 year old who goes by the same name.

A mass shooting has taken place,"**A man wearing a self-designed Delta Air Lines T-Shirt has shot 7 people dead and injured 42.**Airline giant, Delta Air Lines, has today distanced itself from Todd Ihavahoe, after a mass shooting took place today in the sleepy city of Saint George, UT, killing 7 and injuring 42. The shooter, identified by police as 48 year old Todd Ihavahoe, was allegedly wearing a self-designed T-Shirt with the Delta Air Lines logo and name emblazoned on the front. All the victims were wearing self-designed ""I am Harry S Truman"" T-shirts with an image of former President Truman printed on the front with ""Harry S Truman"" printed underneath. Lawyers for the Truman family are reportedly preparing to bring lawsuits against all the victims and their families. Clifton Truman Daniel, one of President Truman's grandchildren, has said he has no knowledge of any lawyers bringing lawsuits on behalf of his family and has sent his condolences to the victims and families of the shooting.Laura Ivanhoe, a second cousin of the shooter, told NBC this morning that she was related to the shooter, Todd Ihavahoe and that he had reportedly changed his name from ""Thomas Jefferson Ivanhoe Washington"" to ""Todd Ihavahoe"" last year after winning $5million on the Mega Millions with a ""Megaplier"" ticket. The Megaplier is an optional add-on feature on a Mega Millions lottery ticket. When players choose to add this option to their ticket they potentially increase their non-jackpot winnings by 2, 3, 4, or 5 times, depending on the Megaplier randomly selected for that draw.

A Man Walks in to A Bar," A man walks in to a bar.The barman says ""knock knock"".""who's there?"" say's the man. He stands and observes the drab, middle-of-the-road interior. A buzzing strip light, cold tilled walls, a crummy counter and a small fly buzzing lazily around the million mile stare adorning the vacant expression of the patron. A man appearing as though he may have always been here, in some manner, among the nameless night shrouded rain wet street, nestled between the sound of traffic breezing by and a cat knocking over a bottle somewhere in the middle distance.""We got a ones sevens special one ninety nine"" says the barman, his eye's flickering for an instant to the present before sinking back into a greyish haze somewhere deep in the recesses of his mind. ""I'll have a kabosh special"" say's the door, ""extra fries and drink one ninety nine"". The barman glances for a moment at the long face of the man before concluding that he must be a little horse. He turns to procure his request.The bottle rolls into the rain and breaks on the cat's curiosity. The sound rings out and the fly knocks the door.""Why the long face?"" say's the horse.The light, having observed this whole circus from it's relative position of illumination, has had enough and makes a leap for the door, casting an incandescent glow across the drab interior. The man watches the patron glow under new hues as he shaves thin slices of time from the rotary spit, etching each cascading unfurl of creation across the vistas of space between totality and the warm bready base. Chips and a drink one ninety nine.&#x200B;A shadow of the man is formed on the wall by the light's escaping draw which in a moment of narrative convenience is stricken by a phase of conscious prescience. Allowing him, it, momentarily, to contend with this seemingly surreptitious subversion of logical conformity. It reminds him, it, of the lady in the old greasy spoons. The gold-yellow neon glow and the smell of fried onions as the star collapsed. He was forever on that horizon at escape velocity, watching the twisting nebulae of time and space sink pressingly toward entropic equilibrium.He remembers falling in forever, he remembers escaping, that light speed moment that was forever and no time at all. He cannot recall being able to separate these sensations and is unnerved by the profound implications of this equivalence.He remembers, though, the lonely aeons and vast distances occurring in an instant massless paradox, before reaching the door.""Knock knock"".""Who's there?"" Say's the man.He's waiting for his order, observing calmly the thin slices of time fall toward the soft bready warmness in the restful palm of the barman's million-mile stare. A stare that speaks to one's impression that this barman has been around forever. ""Have I been around forever"" he thinks as he turn's towards the door.""Who's there?"" Says the man.""A little horse"" Says the Shadow. He observes the drab middle-of-the-road interior cast in iridescence by the light's escaping draw and ponders whether he really ever escaped. Whether all this, him; a locality of lesser cascade, a shadow, really exists at all, or is merely some perfunctory realization of an anthropomorphic personification within the mind of man. Whether the nature of subjectivity at all is truly any different from his momentary space-time construction. Or at least whether he really deserves to be called alive as some physical construct between definite points in time and space, light and dark. Shadow. A shadow of a man waiting for his order. The star collapses.""Why the long face?"" Say's the man, rhetorically, as he reaches for the door handle. ""I'm sorry, I'm a little hor...""The cat's bottle shatters as it falls inexorably toward the middle. It watches the breath-taking unfurl of creation play out in asymptotic fatality without and within. It is both dead and alive.The shadow on the wall watches the barman shave little slices of time from the rotary that fall through space toward the warm bready base within the barman's comforting palm, ""ones sevens kabosh"" say's the barman ""chips and drink ninety nine extra"". He turns toward the man, palm outstretch. A ones sevens kabosh in hand.The palm reaches the light and the man is in Shadow. A million aeons fall as rain upon the traffic flowing gently through that nameless street and a tear falls from his eye. He remembers the aeons, the vast distance, the loneliness and the warm embrace of the barman's comforting palm.He remembers the iridescent glow of the light as it makes for the door and the tear falls toward the event horizon, cast in gold-yellow hues. He remembers falling in forever, he remembers escaping, he cannot recall being able to separate these sensations and is at once consumed by the existential terror at the profound implications of this moment. Is he the tear, is he the shadow, or is he the man? He cannot separate these sensations and is at once comforted by the soft draw of light casting gold yellow hues across the gentle rain on this nameless street.  The tear hangs before him, within and without, as they fall. He stares a million-mile stare as the tear's iridescent glow, caught in the light's escaping draw, shines infinite hues of gold en yellow.  Until, at the last, after aeons of loneliness and vast unimaginable distances, he reaches the door.""Knock knock"" says the Djinn...A man walks in to a bar.",7,AntiAntiJokes.csv

Why the farer nations  with advanced technology are record many more cases everyday.**In Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos:** There are no high-end trains, no commercial 5G network, no fingerprint/face regconical at border airport.**What about China, Korea, Singapore, Japan?** Too many public advanced technology sharing devices like bullet train, 5G network, fingerprint biometrics, etc.I remind all of you that, there are 70%  SARS in the NCOV COVID19, which mean air condition will only help  spreading the virus, including public trains, airport.I highly recommend all the so call  scientist do the experiment about the connection of the NCOV COVID19  with the 4G, 5G network and the electric devices.They can put the NCOV COVID19 in the  environment with 5G, 4G, 3G, 2G, and none and observe the virus  everyday, and they will receive the answer whether or not there is a  huge connection with mobile network with the NCOV COVID19.They should try to put that virus and find  out what surface what objects the NCOV “love”: technology devices,  cloth, sand/clay, etc.Many nations are not using common feeling sense but rely on broken technology and digging their own grave.I have made predictions about the collapse of advanced technology nation at least 1-2 years ago, then now it become reality.If the China, Korea, Japan, Singapore,  Israel, etc. do not stop all the 4G, 5G network, air condition on public  train and stop the fingerprint/biometrics collection on border then  they will all gone within the next 60 days for sure.**If you cannot prove my statement are wrong, then it must be true.****Stop asking me about tiny science  proof evidence for science cannot record many things, including the  super small seed of the NCOV COVID19 !!!**Best Regard,**The Savior**",1,AntiAntiJokes.csv

“I like my women how I like my teddy bears.”,"Charles waited for the punchline, but the punctuation indicated there was none. “Fyodor. Finish the joke.” Alex demanded, pushing Fyodor to the ground. But Fyodor couldn’t, his friend was dead. They looked over at Charles, who had died of Alzheimer’s three years ago. Alex stares at him, his hands shaking as he grabbed the teddy bear from his side. Fyodor, the lawyer, put his hand on Alex’s back and watched the teddy bear with him. The sudden force plunged Alex forwards and onto Charles’ corpse. “You’re going to prison, and it will not be nice.” Alex yelled, the teddy bear was now in Fyodor’s hands. “Great, I’m not compatible with this teddy bear anyways. It is not my type.” Alex, the priest, grabs a cross from his pocket as he stands up. “Who’s there?”The bartender screamed. Apparently, Reddit had tired him and he no longer knew where he was. “Thank god, Alex, you stupid cunt.” He smiled, pointing at the priest’s cross. With the other hand, the bartender opened the Bible. “Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage—with great patience and careful instruction.” He looks up from behind the table. Alex sat there, on the floor, shocked. It was late afternoon, Alex was tired. He undid the knot on his balloon, which he had received on his fifth birthday. The balloon provided him with oxygen as he pondered over the joke Fyodor had told earlier. He drank a sundae that the bartender had made prior, but the drink had already started to phase in and out of existence. “Bartender. I do not like your drink, you should resign.” Alex grumbled, but the bartender was not in sight. Alex wondered where his brother was. “Is this seat taken?” Alex asked the priest as he motioned to the empty seat. But behold, the priest wasn’t there. Alex was the priest. The balloon was empty and he was running out of air. Alex took off his pair of slacks and put them on the counter. A teddy bear rises from behind the counter and takes the slacks. “I’m sorry, teddy bear. I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings.” He stared at the teddy bear who had put on his slacks. It looked more like a woman now. “The seat is empty.” Alex could hear the bartender say, he sat down on the empty seat. “Another sundae.” “What’s the problem, Alex?” Fyodor asked from behind, his hand still resting on his back as it slowly phased into Alex’s body. “Rub it.” Alex responded, Fyodor started rubbing his hand on Alex’s liver. “These sundaes aren’t good for you.” Fyodor said, but Alex insisted on drinking another one. But this time, the sundae had a cockroach in it. Alex ingested the drink orally, as intended. The bartender, his wife, shouts at him: “That’s enough! I’m not happy!” Alex wanted a divorce, his wife was the most selfish woman he had ever met. Fyodor took his hand out of Alex’s body and sat next to him. Alex looked at the teddy bear on the counter and then back at the bartender. “Bridgett. We’re getting a divorce.” He said confidently, but the woman looked at him happily. “Where are we going?” She asked, leaning forwards on the counter. “Nowhere, I don’t take married women to dinner. Now sign the papers.” He demanded, writing his initials on the piece of low quality paper, then handing it to the bartender.“Sign here.” Alex pointed on the paper, Bridgett looked at his hand. She could not sign it. There was no paper. In fact, there was no Bridgett. Fyodor patted Alex’s back as he held hands with the teddy bear. Fyodor was the lawyer and he signed the papers. As for Alex, he was the one who liked his women how he liked his teddy bears, constipated and hungry.",8,AntiAntiJokes.csv

What did five fingers say to the face.,"First you must understand that fingers stem from the hand, they have nerve endings connecting all the way through the spinal chord to the brain... the brain of course has a mind capable of responding to patterns, feeling emotion and rationalizing and making decisions. But does it make decisions? What is consciousness? Let’s say we do have free will, are we not influenced by our surroundings? And suppose we do use our brain to communicate with that hand of ours. If we stared at it long enough could we gain insight in a way as if communicating with it?But does the hand have free will? Does the mind? Do any of us? What does it really mean?And as I sat there pondering the meaning of life I came to think that one could know the secrets of the universe through introspection with a simple question and various ponderings while staring at that hand. And in a single moment my life flashed before my eyes and I came to realize that the hand I was staring at was not my own, that I was in a catatonic state the last 5 hours and I was staring down the hand of a friend who was trying to get me to snap out of this state as the world seemed to stop and I say their frozen. Then it appeared the hand was coiled back as if to lunge sideways across the air. And I realized that perhaps we are all just air filled with individual molecules mostly made up of air with atoms mostly made of air and subatomic particles exhibiting quantum properties like the photon which is able to be in two places at once and constantly moving the same speed relative to the observer and thus perhaps it is in two places at once and two places in space time and if consciousness and time relative to that light changes, perhaps light contains multidimensional properties and is everywhere at once.And if light is an omnipotent, omnipresent nature to all things, perhaps we are all interconnected through the light. And Jesus said behold I am the truth and the light, so perhaps we are all one and religion as science can merge into an ever-present awareness of the self in its relationship to each other and the universe.Just then I saw that hand staring at my face, and I felt warm... for I felt as if I knew the secrets to the universe, consciousness, quantum field theory and life itself.... all from a single hand which had just approach my face.And in that moment I was connected to the everpresent existence to our quantumly entangled world and I felt the presence of the Logos. The word used for Jesus but also a concept meaning word and reason. And I had discovered my true nature as an eternal being within this universe. Behold for as my face is one with the universe... the hand... And then it hit me.I know! What the five fingers as one with the hand in a greater fractal pattern interconnected with fractals of cell’s which connect with fractal of molecules which are a branch of atoms which are a branch of layers of charged and uncharged energy below in patterns of subatomic and quantum level. I know what the five fingers said to the face! I knew it! And I not only knew it! I lived it! I was experiencing it now and it was beutiful. And then I felt the five fingers as a giant network of the universe interlaced through a quantum field interlacing with the blueprint of all matter... and as the five fingers communicated in this way I thought I heard something... it’s a sound that if we listen to the five fingers and hand talking to the face from the fractal pattern of our earth to the solar system down to the atom and up to the galexy from the minute to the gargantuan size of the universe itself and through the interconnected cosmic energy causing the ripple effect of the air vibrating the hairs on our outer ear drum and vibrating the inner ear being translated through the brain and from the brain which processes it all we can hear it as well. We can hear the five fingers saying to the face the inner workings of the universe. In conclusion, as I was pondering this wonderful magnificent feeling, I felt a pain of the five fingers for I was jarred from this infinite bliss and shocked back into reality. And the only thing I knew at that time was the hand and the face, but no longer in a metaphysical way but more of a “physical” way. And despite all of what I had said, at this moment the five fingers said to the face something and I heard and felt it in my face.the five fingers said to the face....SLAP!",0,AntiAntiJokes.csv

Let me tell you what actually happened in the 1700s...,"In the mid 1700s, at the height of the ""Transatlantic Slave Trade"", things take a turn for the worst after aliens from outer space invade.Later nicknamed ""The Black Nordics"" on account of their unusually black skin and piercing blue eyes, this technologically advanced cyborg race suddenly strikes Earth as tens of thousands of Africans are being transported across the Atlantic.The *Mauretania*, an ageing slave ship carrying 976 Africans onboard with 43 European slavers first witnessed the shocking sight.Winged machines, emitting sounds unheard until that moment, whizzed overheard before stunning projectiles were emitted from their bodies and exploded on the *Mauretania*. Most of the slaves and slavers died but a few survivors lived to tell the tale.This marked the first attack.The following few months saw a quick end to the human slave trade as tribes, kingdoms, nations and Empires across Earth quickly realized that ""demons"" from ""another world"" were massacring millions. A British Empire-led resistance recruited tens of millions of men and boys across the world from Central Africa to East Asia to Arabia. In an effort to attempt to defeat The Black Nordics, humans were quick with inventions and technological progress.Although the winged machines of the Black Nordics were few and their great big giant ""city ships"" which carried the winged machines were few, they were powerful and terrifying.The first ""aeroplane"", what humanity now called the ""winged machines"", was invented by two Frenchmen in 1812 after a British Empire-led attack managed to shoot down one of the winged machines and learn more about the technologies involved. Russian allies then began developing what humans now refer to as ""missiles"" with a number of West African allies developing ""land missiles"", technologically advanced projectiles fired with speed from ground-based cannon-like machines.By 1848, the human death toll from the war against the aliens had surpassed 269 million, but a British Empire-led push for higher births to contribute to the fight against the aliens saw the world's population balloon to 5 billion by 1862. With the Black Nordics outnumbered and humanity quickly catching up in technological advancement, the war suddenly ended after the aliens abruptly left Earth, possibly the entire solar system (by then, human understanding of the universe and astronomy and cosmology had progressed quickly in an effort to find out where the aliens actually came from).The aliens had left some of their warships and jets behind and the global alliance which had been built up after the mid-1700s quickly collapsed as conflicts ensued over who got to research the alien technologies and keep them.The British Empire quickly fell as a result and several ""cold wars"" ensued between West Africa and Russia following disagreements between engineers and scientists and the militaries.North America was carved up between the Confederation of West Africa and the Republic of Britannia (the offspring of the British Empire), which labelled regions in North America as ""dependencies"" and ""territories"".The First World War began in 1879 after border disputes in North America between the Confederation of West Africa and the Republic of Britannia.The Confederation allies included The French Republic, the Spanish Republic, the Imperial States of Russia (a new monster which had gobbled up half of Asia and Eastern Europe), the Aboriginal League (the informal Australasian ""nation"" which had a combined population of 200 million following population explosions during the war with the aliens), the Nordic Union (now recovering from its depressing ostracization following the alien invasion) and the Seven Kingdoms of India.The Republic of Britannia's allies included the Duchy of New Africa, an extremely oil and mineral-rich ""dependency"" in the southeast of North America, the Portuguese Federation, the North Atlantic League (a loose union of Eastern European revolutionaries fighting against the ISR), the Republic of New Africa, another resources-rich ""dependency"" in southwestern North America, the Holy Roman Union, a semi-formal political and economic union stretching from Northwestern Africa and Italia to Germanic regions in Western Europe, which had rotating capitals, with Ljubljana being the current ""capital of Europe"" during the First World War. Many labelled the Holy Roman Union as ""the center of the world"", with its post Greco-Roman architecture and heavy religious presence. (The Pope is the official head of state and the head of the Roman Catholic church. He selects the government cabinet and the First Minister, the head of government.) When people say ""Europe"", images of towns and cities in the Holy Roman Union spring to mind. The economic and political powerhouse largely bankrolled the Britannia-led side in the First World War.To be continued...",58,AntiAntiJokes.csv

Liam Neeson was masturbating in the living room when his phone rang.,"Liam frowned upon the phone vibrating and ringing on the table as he released his grip and tucked his johnson back into his pants. Someone had been calling him repeatedly during the afternoon and talking incoherently.""This prank-calling prick just won't let it rest, time to end this."" Liam muttered under his breath. He answered the phone, the person at the other end started talking:""Eeeeh, hngggg, hewp, I nnnnehhd hewp! Mmmb-mmb. I nnnhhed ampuwance.""Liam rolled his eyes and replied: ""I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you're having a laugh over there, I can tell you I don't have the same appreciation for this as you do, but what I do have are a very particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long acting career, starring in action movies. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you stop calling me now, that will be the end of it.

He uttered, softly. Liam continued to masturbate. The phone would ring a couple of times and Liam would hang up. An hour went by and Kellyanne Conway was now debating someone on the TV.""Yes, you keep running that stupid whore mouth of yours, you .. eerr..you..blonde.. stupid... whore. Ah,  whatever, I'm getting close."" Liam mumbled.Liam's wife suddenly stormed into the living room and spoke, anxiously: ""I have some terrible news, honey! Your father had a stroke, more than an hour ago. He didn't make it. I-I'm so sorry.""Liam sat silently with his dick resting in his hand. Liam blinked twice at his wife, not replying. An awkward silence permeated the living room, a silence that was occasionally broken by the screams of the autistic neighbour from across the street. Liam suddenly widened his eyes, looking both disturbed and agitated at the same time and said: ""W-wait, I'm just starting to realize..shit, I j-just..""Liam's wife looked at him empathically and said: ""Yes, honey? What is it? It's okay, we'll get through this, together.""Liam replied, in an frustrated manner:""I just realized that I can't catch a mother/FUCKING/ break in this house, ever! I get this ONE day off the film set and get to release some fucking tension and have a good time, but noooooo! The phone goes off every 5 minutes, the dog outside keeps barking, the austistic neighbour keeps screaming, sounding like a broken fucking siren, Larry King comes on the TV and ruins my mood and leaves my dick completely limp for 40 minutes, YOU take the liberty to just walk in on me when I'm CLEARLY busy, my fucking father decides to die NOW?! REALLY? Enough of this! Get out and let me finish what I've been trying to accomplish for several hours!""Liam's wife started crying and left the room in a hurry.""Now, where was I?!"" Liam exclaimed before the phone rang again. He still didn't recognize his father's cellphone number as he looked at the display. He answered it.The voice at the other end sounded distant and was partially interrupted by static, it went: ""Liam, you jackass! I was \*static\*ying to tell you that I neede\*static\* help. Your number was t\*static\* only number I was able to call at the time through the phone log! I'm fuc\*static\* dead now, you've killed me, son! You've k-..""Liam interrupted his disembodied father and yelled: ""Stop. Calling. Me. Stop calling me already! I have no idea what you're talking about! I just want to masturbate in peace! Leave me alone!""His ghostly father replied: ""Is that the fu\*static\* TV I'm hearing in the background?! Are you seriously getting off to a TV broadcast again? Have you ever hear\*static\* of internet porn?!""Liam threw his phone at the wall, shattering it and finally climaxed just as the TV image shifted from Kellyanne Conway to Larry King again. Liam suddenly formed an angry facial expression and yelled at the TV:""Go to hell, Larry King! Another orgasm ruined by Larry fucking King! You asshole! I'm going to look for you, find you and then I'm going to kill you!""",2,AntiAntiJokes.csv

Replied the man behind him.""You're being very insensitive to your paying customers, honey. We're not going to take it."" Said the third in line.The bartender smirked and said: ""You all seem to already be taking it, you're way ahead of yourselves there.""The bartender then looked inbetween the men individually, shooting quick glances at their lower bodies before speaking again: ""I'm not having this kind of sexual behaviour and deviancy in my bar, either stop it or get out.""""Stop what? We're not doing anything sexual, we're all conjoined octuplets!"" Replied the 4th man.""We can't help it! We were born this way!

Come on, gang, we're leaving!"" Said the man in the lead.The bartender sighed and said: W-wait, I'm sorry. How was I supposed to know that?""The human centipede, ignoring the bartender, gradually turned around while taking up a lot of space in order to do so, moving in a similar fashion to that of a semi-truck and headed towards the exit.After they had left a group of black men in balaclavas/ski masks walked in, carrying various items with them such as car tires, hub caps, a TV, a Blue Ray player and sneakers, among other things.The bartender cocked an eyebrow and exclaimed: ""Whoah, hey there! Where did you get all those items from? I'm not about to serve a bunch of unidentifiable blacks on a burglary spree, while rioting or whatever the hell is going on here!""All the men stopped in their tracks, looking shocked. One of the men spoke up: ""Excuse me!? These are my friends and they're helping me move. None of us could provide any transportation so we have to carry these several blocks. It's also a cold winter night so we decided cover our faces. We were starting to feel a little parched so we decided to get something to drink!""""Fuck you, man! Let's bounce, homies!"" Said another.""For crying out loud, wait!"" Yelled the bartender.The men ignored the bartender and left.Next came a group of what seemed to be hooded clansmen from the KKK. The bartender, now feeling distraught due to his prior encounters, tried to force a smile and a more likeminded and friendly demeanour. He looked at them gleefully and said: ""Finally, my type of crowd! I like it! White power, right? What can I get you fine gentlemen?""The group stopped approaching the counter, one of them replied: ""That's disgusting! We're doing a performance in the theatre across the street in fifteen minutes and don't have enough time to remove and put on our costumes again. We're just looking to steady our nerves with a few drinks, since this is the premiere and an important night for us!""""Let's go to the bar at the end of the street, screw this place."" Another member exclaimed.The bartender groaned and dug his face onto the bar counter in embarrasment as they left.A group of disfigured people walked in next, some had distorted bodies and impaired limbs, while others had large facial scars and deformed skulls. After looking up from the counter again, the bartender was somewhat apprehensive about saying anything but eventually decided to speak, again forcing a more social and friendly demeanour:""Ah, you guys must be part of the theatre play too.

Upon hearing their footsteps, the bartender raised his head from the counter.""No, come on! You've got to be kidding me! This is getting fucking ridiculous, I'm not touching this one with a ten foot pole!"" The bartender yelled.""Actually, wait. Before I manage to offend another group of paying customers, let me guess.

A dog walks into a bar.,"The dog sits up on the counter seat, attracting some strange looks from patrons. One of the two customers sitting next to the dog hold out their hand as if asking if he could be petted, but the dog avoids their hands, leaving a slightly confused look on the customer's face.""What can I get you?"" the bartender asks. ""I would like to have a beer, please; more specifically, a non-alcoholic beer without the beer."" the dog replies snobbishly, with an accompanied snort.The bartender looks slightly bemused at the dog's strange request, but accepts the order anyway.  After a few minutes of the bartender serving other patrons, the dog's order is given to him within three seconds: an empty glass. The expression on the dog's face, originally as neutral as a dog's face can be, now looks slightly annoyed. Before the bartender can leave, the dog challenges the bartender with ""This is not what I asked for.""The bartender says ""Huh? You asked for a beer without a beer. That's what I gave you.""The dog snorts. ""Excuse me, it was a _non-alcoholic_ beer. And this is not what I asked for. You see, I asked for an impossible request: I asked for something that qualifies as a beer but is not a beer, and is non-alcoholic. Clearly, nothing can fit this description by the law of non-contradiction, and yet you still gave me something. This means that whatever you have given me is incorrect.""The bartender replies with ""It may have been the case that the denotative meaning of the thing you asked clearly has no match, and is therefore impossible; however, the connotative meaning of what you asked is that you wanted the package of a beer, glass + beer, minus alcohol, minus the beer. That's simply a glass minus the alcohol, and since a glass has no alcohol, this is what you wanted under your connotative meaning.""The dog replies snarkily ""Being a dog, I clearly evade human intuition when it comes to thought. When you took my order, a good bartender would have seen the dog in the seat and realized that since the dog thinks in a completely different way than humans do that it may choose to use the declarative meaning rather than the connotative in order to avoid confusion, and therefore taken the declarative meaning as the thing that the dog wanted.""The bartender questions ""Yet you, as a dog, are currently speaking perfect English, and replying to my responses perfectly. This means that you must indeed have an understanding of the connotative meaning of how humans speak in order to even respond to the responses I am giving you. Therefore, you know that connotative meanings are taken into account, and therefore provided something that fits under the connotative meaning rather than the declarative.""The dog says, ""Indeed! However, I simply accounted for the fact that if you were a _good_ bartender, then you would have taken the declarative meaning, and provided me with what I wanted. And remember that the only reasonable response to the connotative meaning of the order would be to take the declarative meaning under general human behavior, you would have done what I wanted anyway! Therefore, I simply accounted for the declarative meaning, and not the connotative.""The bartender exclaims, ""Enough! We all know that this is folly. The _true_ answer here is that whereas you, as a dog, somehow use perfect declarative meaning and the logical axioms to construct your perception of the world, we as humans use connotative meaning and ill-defined axioms to construct our perception of the world. The fundamental difference here is in the axiomatic system being used, and therefore can never be fixed unless one of us changes our fundamental axioms, which is impossible without killing ourselves.""The dog says with a tone of finality, ""However, since I still feel annoyed, I can and will disprove the fundamental axioms of human perception as even being axioms in the first place, and simply construct for myself a bar where the bartender is a _good_ bartender _and_ the declarative meaning is taken into account first.""Around the dog, the lights flicker rapidly before cutting out, removing all light in the bar. Several of the patrons look around in surprise, and a guy reading a book in the back looks up disappointed.  Then, the patron next to the dog begins to flicker. Their image seems to randomly stretch in its dimensions and change state, from the patron smiling to drunk to depressed to crying to naked to nonexistent. Several of the patrons seeing one of their members dissipate this suddenly rapidly begin to panic, and they flood out of the bar quickly. The bartender, however, makes no attempt to move as the floorboards stretch and crack under the stress of being logically disproven to even exist. A strange expression appears on the bartender's face before morphing into a smile.Suddenly, all logical disproving stops. The lights turn back on to illuminate a now mostly empty bar, and the floorboards seem to be back where they were. Even the patron next to the dog reappears again.The dog exclaims in horror, ""What happened?!"" The dog's face looks shallow at considering that _their_ axioms may be inconsistent.The bartender smiles and simply says ""I have figured out your little 'trick', and have something for you. Since you have proven our logical axioms inconsistent, by the principle of explosion, I can prove anything I want. 1+1=3, something that is true is false, and you are nonexistent and never have ever existed.""The dog looks horrified at his blunder and immediately jumps off the bar stool in an attempt to dash away, and fails. The dog's image beings to warp and stretch, cycling through everything the dog has ever done before immediately collapsing back in on itself and everything in the bar reverting. The bar looks the same as it always had, with the same customer in the corner reading a book, an empty stool that might have housed a dog if a dog came into the bar, and patrons drinking their beer as usual.What the bartender doesn't realize, though, is that he himself committed a blunder, a blunder so significant that he cannot ever realize he had committed it. By making the dog not exist via the principle of explosion, he himself has forgotten how to manipulate the logical makeup of the world around him and therefore has given up the power over everything in existence and everything not in existence, something that kings and queens and presidents have striven for for eons.Perhaps you could say that the bartender's blunder was _explosively_ bad.",5,AntiAntiJokes.csv

A scandal involving Homelander and a transgender woman,"Homelander was in the process of roughly and violently apprehending 4 high-value suspects in a terror cell when he noticed that a blonde-haired transgender woman was filming him on their iPhone.He bellowed across to the individual to stop filming him.The bystander shook their head vigorously and yelled back that they will upload the video to YouTube ""so that everybody can know what a bad man you are"".Homelander bellowed back that the bystander was a ""stupid bitch"" and that they looked ""like a fucking whore"" (Homelander's words).The bystander was visibly shocked and protested that they were extremely offended and that they were ""proud to be transgender"". Homelander then zipped across the street and smashed the bystander's iPhone and then flew away.Another bystander had been filming the altercation from behind his Buick and promptly uploaded it to Twitter, YouTube and Facebook amongst other sites.The bystander (the one who identified as a woman) was later interviewed by several large media outlets and the story became front-page news and even overtook coverage of Presidential impeachment hearings. The scandal then made global news after the now-nationally famous bystander apparently ""spontaneously combusted"" live on-air during an interview with MSNBC.The bystander's family sued Homelander and Vought International for US$17m and US$23m respectively.The other bystander has now been deported to Mexico following an immigration raid.",0,AntiAntiJokes.csv

"A rusty old knight, a rusty old knight and a clown walk into a bar.","The bar is a bar for rusty old knights - a tavern if you will - which means that the bartender is a rusty old knight, the bar-wenches are rusty old knights, the porters, grooms and stewards are rusty old knights. Even the rusty old accountant is a rusty old knight.The rusty old knight says to the rusty old knight:""Good sir, my only quest is to drink a flagon of ale in a tavern staffed exclusively by rusty old knights. It is my rusty old purpose. The only thing that keeps me going.""The rusty old knight says to the rusty old knight:""Good sir, *my* only quest is to keep this rusty old knight from ever drinking a single flagon of ale in any tavern staffed exclusively by rusty old knights, in order to sustain this rusty old knight's fragile sense of purpose.

This, is **my** rusty old purpose, and the only reason for which I own and manage a tavern for rusty old knights, staffed exclusively by rusty old knights.""And so, the three knights fall into a co-dependent relationship: the rusty old knight vies to furnish the rusty old knight with a flagon of ale. The rusty old knight vies to receive a flagon of ale from the rusty old knight. And the rusty old knight vies to keep the rusty old knight from receiving a flagon of ale from the rusty old knight, and to keep the rusty old knight from furnishing the rusty old knight with a flagon of ale. In this way the trio becomes a three-way nexus - a self-sustaining cycle of deferred resolution in which each member is continuously on the point of, but never reaches fulfilment.Over time this abstract relationship begins to take on a concrete from of its own, eventually manifesting as a rusty old triangle, which the narrator carefully peels out of the joke, and sews into the flag of Guyana.""I don't understand,"" says Adelia Smith, third wife of professional vexillologist Whitney Smith, designer of the flag of Guyana ""why did you go to all the trouble of weaving a narrative about three rusty old knights, each dependent on the others if all you wanted was another triangle for your flag? And more to the point, why did you include the clown in the premise when you didn't refer to him once in the rest of the joke?""""I'm a professional vexillologist,"" says professional vexillologist Whitney Smith, ""and if you think you can tell *me* a better way of getting triangles, I'd like to hear it.""",15,AntiAntiJokes.csv

Four Nuns Walk Into a Bar,"Each one has brought her own drink.The First Nun produces a small bottle of whiskey, saying ""I've heard drinking is a sin, so I'll only drink a little.""The second nun pulls out an average bottle of whiskey, saying ""I heard drinking is a sin, so I'll drink enough that I won't be able to remember doing it.""The third nun shows off a huge bottle of whiskey, saying ""Drinking is a sin, so I'll just drink enough that neither me nor God himself will remember!""The fourth nun says nothing.  A low, unholy gurgle escapes her lips.  Her eyes turn a glassy white and her skin a sallow green.  The other nuns at the table start to stand up and back away, but she throws her head back and a battery of devilish spikes emerge from inside her throat.  They run, but the spikes explode out from the beast, embedding into the bodies of the nuns, the bartender, all the patrons in the crossfire unable to flee.The bartender clutches his impaled shoulder, watching the second and third nuns choke and convulse in front of him.  He feels the toxins course though his own veins and accepts his death.  The fourth nun crawls towards him on all fours, and he can see its jaw unhinge like an angler fish through his blurring vision.  Its putrid breath hits his nostrils.  But suddenly, the First Nun stands up, seemingly unharmed.  She pounces from behind, wrapping a rosary around the neck of the beast, shouting into its ear a prayer the likes of which the bartender has never heard.  The beast screams, and its flesh smokes, and it wrestles and fights for its impure life dragging the First Nun behind the bar.After a moment the First Nun emerges, battered but victorious.  She limps to the still conscious bartender and presses the small whiskey bottle to his lips.  ""Not alcohol.  It's antivenom.  Drink.""  He obeys.  After a minute he feels fine.  He surveys the destruction around him, the two dead nuns, and despite his gratitude he can't help but ask the one burning question in his mind.He points to the thing behind the bar and asks ""what the hell is that?""The First Nun watches as a fifth nun walks into the bar wearing a neatly pressed suit and tie, carrying a briefcase.

His mother looked more enthusiastic than he did. Sitting there, huge hat on her head, like a big meringue - sobbing and smiling. 'They're so dreamy together!' she kept saying. Talk about living vicariously through your children.Imam: Happens more than you think. You see so many young people still at the beck and call of their parents instead of living their own lives.Rabbi: Yeah, and it's a real shame. If I'd gone the way my mother had wanted, I'd probably still be in that cramped little office in Milwaukee, making ten dollars an hour, wishing I could shove every rotten cent up my boss's ass.

A penguin is ice fishing at the North pole.,"""I hope to catch some fish today,"" says the penguin.

You could have a serious allergic reaction.""The largemouth bass swims around the baited hook in contemplation. The penguin watches hungrily from above. After a few moments, the bass opens its maw, and lunges towards the bait. The worm is sucked from the hook and proceeds into the bass's gizzard, while the hook becomes lodged in its cheek. The penguin jerks the fishing pole upward securing the catch, and lifts the largemouth bass from the water.The penguin leans in close to the bass's large green eye. ""Hello, I'm a penguin, and I eat largemouth bass.""The largemouth bass shrinks its mouth around the line, below the Planck length of 1.6 x 10\^-35 m.^(""Oh, is that so?"")Upon measurement from the penguin, uncertainty in the bass's velocity exceeds the speed of light as predicted by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The bass is torn from reality itself, severing the line. As the bass's mouth returns to normal size, it manifests underwater in a world orbiting an alien sun. Unfortunately, when the hook and attached line reach the fish's gizzard, the fish has an allergic reaction to the wool and dies.The bait, hook, line, and bass go to heaven and meet St. Peter at the pearly gates.""Why should I let you in to heaven?"" asks St. Peter.""I'm a sentient gummy worm, the fancy sugar coated kind,"" says the worm.

St. Peter lets the hook into heaven, where it penetrates the worm, resuming its natural place within the bait.""I'm a sentient strand of wool, the fancy superwash merino kind,"" says the line. St. Peter lets the line into heaven, where it ties itself around the hook, restoring the trinity of bait, hook, and line.""I'M A LARGEMOUTH BASS, AND I EAT SUGAR-COATED GUMMY WORMS, GROOVED PAPERCLIP HOOKS, AND SUPERWASH MERINO WOOL LINES.""""Oh, is that so?"" says St. Peter, as his cranium opens to project a hologram of the bass's sub-Planck length mouth from moments earlier.

A Man Walks Into a Bar,"However, he leaves as soon as he enters. More Antiantijokes need to end like this. The man only left because it was crowded in there, from all the ""Walks into a bar"" Antiantijokes there are. Just because an infinite number of mathematicians can fit into the bar doesn't mean it should contain an infinite number of individuals. For fucks sake people, there's only a single Bartender, how's he supposed to tend to all the patrons in there.Anyways, the bartender, sick of tending to all the patrons in the bar, pulled out a gun with an infinite amount of ammunition, and shot himself in the head. The first of a set of an infinite number of mathematicians took his place. However, after doing the math, the mathematician came to the conclusion that tending to all the patrons was mathematically impossible. He picked up the gun, but the second of a set of an infinite number of mathematicians asked how he knew he was the first of a set of an infinite number of mathematicians, and not, say for example the seven hundred twenty six nonillion three hundred twenty nine octillion five hundred seventy two heptillion six hundred fifty eight hexillion seven hundred forty seven quintillion two hundred eighteen quadrillion seventy one trillion four hundred six billion nine hundred ninety nine million six hundred and sixty sixth mathematician. The first mathematician, confused at how the second came up with such a small number, told him that the numbering system was completely arbitrary; he's the first because he decided he would be the lowest numbered mathematician, and the second is the second, because he was the first mathematician he saw that wasn't himself. The first mathematician then shoots himself in the head, leaving the second mathematician to become the first.The new first mathematician comes to the same mathematical conclusion that the previous, being that it would be mathematically  impossible to serve every patron in the bar. He picked up the gun, but the new second of a set of an infinite number of mathematicians asks how he knows he's the first of a set of an infinite number of mathematicians, and not yet another arbitrarily small number. The first mathematician gives the same answer as the previous first mathematician, then shoots himself in the head.This cycle continues until we reach the final first of a set of an infinite number of mathematicians. He comes to the same conclusion the previous infinity mathematicians about serving all the patrons being impossible, and picks up the gun. However, since there is no new second mathematician to ask him how he knows he's the first mathematician, and not some arbitrarily small number, he is able to answer the question by stating that he's the only mathematician left from the set of an infinite number of mathematicians, and puts the gun down.There is, however, a second unique set of an infinite number of mathematicians in the bar. The first mathematician from the previous set attempts to use the gun to shoot them all, but discovers that the gun is out of ammunition. The first mathematician of the second set of an infinite number of mathematicians asks for 1 beer, the second asks for half a beer, the third asks for a quarter of a beer. The first mathematician from the first set of an infinite number of mathematicians puts 2 beers on the counter, and tell the infinite number of mathematicians to split the beer among themselves. The first mathematician from the first set of an infinite number of mathematicians the exits the bar.The first mathematician encounters the man who walked into the bar earlier, but left, and tells the man that there are an infinite and one fewer people in the bar, so it should be far less crowded. The man then walks into the bar, and finds an infinite number of dead people lying at the counter. He tries to order a beer, but finds there are no bartenders. He finds the set of an infinite number of mathematicians arguing over who's the nine hundred twenty seven billion six hundred ninety two million eight hundred six thousand and twenty seventh mathematician, and who's the nine hundred twenty seven billion six hundred ninety two million eight hundred six thousand and twenty eighth mathematician. The man kindly asks the set of an infinite number of mathematicians where the bartender went. The four hundred sixty seventh mathematician tells him that the bartender's had his limit, and does not exist.",63,AntiAntiJokes.csv

A goat came into my place of work today,"I work in my downstairs bathroom counting the individual splashes of water that appear on the floor from the various appliances, i.e. the bathtub, the shower, the toilet, the sink etc. I measure the number, the size, and how long the splashes take to evaporate (which can be several hours during the winter). Splashes invariably occur from collisions between water and the people using the appliances, say my family or me, more often than not.Now, I know what you're thinking, what about when me or my family get out of the bath and water drops from our bodies on to the floor, do those splashes count? Do I count large pools of water? If two drops join, do I count them as one drop or two? Well, yes, the answers you suspect for those questions are indeed correct. I make a reasonable living doing what I do and I enjoy the challenges, plus I of course get to work from home.Today, after my wife had gone to work and taken the kids to school, there were about 37 individual splashes of water on the floor of my downstairs bathroom. They weren't large. Don't worry, me and my family are not slobs. The splashes were of a size that it was reasonable to have left them on the floor if you had something else to do that day. I had marked their positions and taken photographic evidence. Stopwatches for each had been started and I then had to keep on top of any of them evaporating into nothingness. You probably thought this line of work was pretty easy, but imagine keeping an eye on 37 stopwatches and getting all the time details accurate.At about 13:45 the goat came in. I don't know if you've ever looked a goat in the eye, but there's a certain kind of angry intelligence that you can sense in there, that's despite their lack of ability to verbally communicate. You look a goat in the eye and you can tell there is a lot going on, and there's not a lot of what is going on that that goat is happy about.The goat left, maybe 14:15 at a rough estimate, and I carried on watching the drops and accounting for any new splashes I might happen to make during my toilet breaks.",2,AntiAntiJokes.csv

A square cup walks into a bar.,"The square cup says to the bartender, ""Man, life's been rough lately.

I beg you, pour me a pint of your special ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄ to help me forget for a little while.""The bartender, not wishing to further pry into the cup's personal life, quietly obliges, pouring a pint of ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄ into the talking cup's head. Immediately, the glass of ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄ suspiciously transforms into a glass of root beer with equal mass and volume. Although one would assume a square cup would have experience with such a phenomenon, the square cup is taken aback. Not wanting to raise any suspicion about his surprise, he pays for the drink, thanks the bartender, and leaves the bar with his heart pounding.As the square cup gets his wits about him, he immediately contacts a porcelain manufacturer based in China. He arranges for a shipment of 500 porcelain square cups to be sailed to the United States every other Tuesday for 20,000 Chinese Yuan, having paid for the first shipment through a large loan. Once the first shipment arrives, the cup takes the public transport to the very same bar, a luxury which he can seldom afford. He walks into the bar armed with ten identical square cups. ""Pour me ten pints of your finest ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄,"" the cup demands of the bartender.Not wanting to miss out on the profits that could be made by selling ten pints of the notoriously expensive ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄, the bartender silently obliges, pouring the square cup ten shimmering pints of ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄ into each of the square cups. The ten pints of ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄ begin to change composition once more into root beer, as the original square cup predicted. He rushes out of the bar and to the local market to sell some of this substance. Those who purchase it regard it as ""the purest and most delicious root beer the world has ever seen,"" and its market value skyrockets.As the Chinese workers labor, producing more and more square porcelain cups, the original square cup begins to increase his scale of production more and more, hiring more and more employees to demand more and more ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄ from the original bartender. As the square cup's pile of money exponentially increases in size, the entire world develops an inexplicable addiction to the new, purest form of root beer. The formula is kept secret from the public, ensuring a perpetual monopoly on the production of pure, addictive root beer. Indeed, the entirety of humanity becomes helplessly enslaved by the iron grip of the Square Cup, as He is the only one who sells that which they must purchase. The men and women of America speak His name with a tone of mixed fear and admiration. All men and women love the Square Cup. All hail the Square Cup. All hail.",71,AntiAntiJokes.csv

"A monk walks up to a hotdog stand and says, ""Make me One with everything.""","He hands the vendor $10. The vendor instantly understands the philosophical nature of the request, and within a fraction of a second, he abstracts the Universe to it's component concepts, thoughts, feelings, ideas, and objects. He then unifies these into a single collective consciousness. He hands the monk a plain hotdog. The monk, now being omnipotent and omniscient, understands the vendor instantly. He is now One with everything, including the hotdog, and thus the hotdog is One with everything, fulfilling the monk's request. Despite knowing the answer inherently, the monk feels compelled to ask the vendor, ""Where's my change?"" his voice booming with the force of the entire Universe behind it. The vendor, too, is now One with everything and thus One with the monk, and as a result, understands the philosophical nature of the request, and the appropriate answer: ""Change must come from within.""The monk realizes that he is One with the vendor as well as the abstract concept of time, and thus was able to instantly understand and comply with his own request of Oneness just a moment earlier. He realizes that in achieving Oneness, he has created a closed time loop, which resulted in the compelling force he felt earlier. He has doomed himself to relive these moments infinitely, at every point in time, simultaneously. In order to relieve himself of this plight, he decides to kill himself in the form of the vendor. Unfortunately, he has no understanding of paradoxes as they are constructs that occur outside of reality and thus are not part of his Oneness. Though he only intends to destroy his vendor form, doing so destroys it at every point in time, thereby preventing his Oneness and precluding the existence of the entire Universe. The Universe instantly understands this, and promptly ceases to exist.",278,AntiAntiJokes.csv

Don’t you know that some birds who eat too quickly might implode?”Growing more massive by the second while maintaining the same size, the turkey continues gobbling, until it suddenly shrinks into a black hole, feathers flying everywhere that are soon pulled inwards to be never seen again.A dark spherical void with a mysterious pull floats in the middle of the bar and begins to slowly dissipate over the next million years.

A horse walks into a bar,"The bartender promptly, and understandably might I add, freaks out and screeches in despair at the sudden disturbance within his peaceful tavern. The man collapses straight onto the table and folds over in a crumpled heap upon the floor. The brobdingnagian line of people waiting for fruit punch are all outraged at the horse for effectively murdering Steve, their bartender, server of drinks, divider of liquid, distributor of refreshments. They immediately beat the horse to death in extreme anger and annoyance at the mahoosive kerfuffle that it has caused. The line disperses and they all go their separate ways for there is now nobody to serve them drinks and they are lost in life, like a leaf without a tree, or a cub with no mom. Lost, with no hope of survival or purpose. No chance of ever amounting to anything. Tom stumbles out of the bathroom,  a line of puke trailing behind him in a slippery mess. ""WHERE IS THE PUNCHLINE!"" He yells, outraged.",91,AntiAntiJokes.csv

Two atheists are in an oven,"One atheist turns to the other and says ""Boy, it sure is hot as hell in here""The other atheist says ""Boy, no shit! We're in an oven! How the hell did we get in here?""The chef hears their cries, pulls out a knife, starts chopping chives, and answers ""You're in Hell's Kitchen now! That's how.""Both atheists, equally shocked by the depth of their realization, reply in unison ""You've got to be joking!""The chef smirks. His eyes shine wildly. He knows what he be feeding the homeless during the cold December months...Two renegade atheists who posed as christians so they could con my church into giving them Thanksgiving turkey for free. Not as long as my church still calls me Father Pete, the Turkey ManThe chef turns toward the oven, his priest collar pops out from under his apron. He says ""My God you're right! I was joking."" Father Pete motions toward his collar. ""Now you may understand.""The atheists, slowly baking, take a gander at the collar and become frantic. One atheist says ""but isn't it against your religion to harm others? Commandment XI says ""Thou shall not kill' You must let us out or you will commit a cardinal sin and be sent to Hell""The chef sneers at the atheist through the charcoal dusted oven window ""THOU ART AN ATHEIST. THOU DOS AS THOU PLEASES WITH NO REGARD TO THE SHADOW OF GOD AND SATAN!WHAT KNOW YOU OF SIN!?""The other atheist, burning alive, chimes in ""Uh pretty much only Commandment XI. Plus everybody knows atheists dont go well with chives. We are too jive for that turkey, man.""Pastor Pete was taken aback by this statement. His ego swells with a sense of pride ""You are aware of what they call me?""One atheist (it doesn't matter which one anymore) despite the heated convection currents bubbling his skin, says ""Of course we knew of your title, you're Pastor Pete the Turkey Man! Curator of the best damn turkey this side of the Earth""Pastor Pete deepens his thought and his mood. He realizes that enjoying a simple Thanksgiving shouldn't be hindered by belief systems or backgrounds and that his turkey could bring people of any turkey ingesting belief together. He pondered for a moment, while the atheists screamed in agony, just how he should change his ways, maybe how he could be more ""hip and in"" with new cultures that differ from his. Pastor Pete opens the oven door only to realize that the atheist had cooked just past the point of living. Immediately he feels ashamed and is overcome by a need to repent. He jumps into the oven and closes the self locking door. And thats how you make a Jive Turkey Man.",4,AntiAntiJokes.csv

He immediately picked up the scent of a polar bear, but could not tell if the trail was leading into or out of his bar since he had no eyes. Nonetheless, he tracked the polar bear one mile in a straight line, then turned 90 degrees left and tracked the polar bear another mile in a straight line, and did this twice more before the trail stopped at the point where the polar bear had manifest into the joke. Realizing that he had tracked it in the wrong direction, the bartender turned 90 degrees left, and walked one mile in a straight line to return to the bar.""...beer"" decided the polar bear.""Why the big \[pause/paws\]?"" said the bartender before shooting the polar bear.What color was the bartender?HINT 1: >!Told aloud, the listener does not know whether the bartender said ""pause"" or ""paws"". Since the bartender was not present in the bar while the polar bear was thinking, he could not have known if indeed the polar bear had paused, or had just repeated the word ""beer"" aloud until the bartender returned. So the bartender must have said the word ""paws"".!<HINT 2: >!However, we are also told that the bartender does not have eyes. The bartender must have deduced that the polar bear had large paws (for a polar bear) after tracking it out of the bar.!<HINT 3: >!The only piece of information the bartender could have gained from leaving the bar, following the scent, and returning, is the geometry of the landscape. Indeed, the bartender walked in the path of a regular pentagon with four right angles. This is only possible in hyperbolic space. Since this information is new to the bartender, he must have known that space was not hyperbolic before the polar bear journeyed to the bar, and therefore this change was caused by the polar bear. Only massive paws are capable of doing this.!<HINT 4:  >!A deduction such as this can only be made by a bartender with an advanced degree in physics. This bartender also owns a rifle and tends to shoot his patrons.

""Hello, customer FG352, Dale Pale.""""Witness,"" said Dale, which I'm pretending is a future greeting used by the masses.""What can I play for you today?"" asked the jukebox. ""The usual?""""No, not the usual,"" said Dale, ""I-""""-Not Unusual by Tom Jones, coming up...""""What!? No!"" said Dale. Tom Jones could be heard singing from all the speakers of the bar. Not the real Tom Jones of course, he had been dead for forty years or so. Tom Jones for all the children reading this is a real person, a welsh singer with weird hair who tried a comeback some time around 2000 but honestly it was kind of sad because he was singing collaborations with that hot chick from The Cardigans even though there appeared to be about a ninety year age difference.Dale Pale despised this song to the point that it always made him tear his hair out. But one artist that enraged him even more was Marvin Gaye.""Why?"" asked the reader. ""Was he racist?""""No,"" said me, ""But assuming its because he was racist is a bit racist!""Dale Pale stood in the dark bar pulling at his hair, screaming. Blood formed around his eye holes. ""What's going on!?""""What's Going On by Marvin Gaye, coming up..."" said the robotic voice of the jukebox.""No!"" screamed Dale Pale, in agony. Smoke began pouring out of his ears. His knee caps caved in and he was slowly stumbling to the floor.

A quantum physicist walks into a bar,"“I have arrived!” exclaims the physicist as he moves quickly towards the counter, eager for his first whiskey.“I’m not so sure”, says the bartender. “Your current momentum scatters my knowledge of your location.”“But at our macroscopic scale, quantum effects don’t apply here”, says the physicist, still twitching for his anticipation of a drink. Or perhaps it was the amphetamines. “You still have to admit that you yourself are a wavefunction!” says the bartender, then raises his arm to point out a sign in the window that reads “QUANTUM EFFECTS APPLY HERE”.“Well I never said I was a good physicist...” said the okay physicist. “That’s why I’ve come actually. You see, I’m very much in need of employment. I’m willing to do whatever it takes.”“It just so happens that there is an open position available. Can you fill it?” questions the bartender.While skipping a beat, the physicist calms down and walks behind the counter to reach a narrow door in the corner of the bar. He opens the door and rolls out a dusty vacuum, finds an open outlet nearby, plugs it in, and begins cleaning up the floor of the establishment.“Don’t you think that’s a bit loud for this time of morning?” the bartender asked with a loud voice and a concerned look on his face. “It might frighten the patrons.”Unaware that the bartender had said anything because he had his noise cancelling headphones on while working, the janitor continued to vacuum, until he began noticing a rumbling in the floors and stools and tequila bottles of the bar slowly building in strength by the second. With a giant fervor, a wooden exterior wall bursts apart, revealing the cause of the rumble: a stampede of elephants, wildebeests, sharks, and rhinos. The custodian quickly leapt backwards, avoiding the deadly stampede narrowly. It wasn’t until the dust settled that he noticed that his duties would be no more - the vacuum was crushed into hundreds and hundreds of minute pieces. Reluctantly realizing his fate, it was then that the workman began to collapse as his corporeal form slowly faded away.“I’ve no time for this!” exclaimed the bartender, as he vigorously scrubs down the counter, now with shatters of glass spread about. But he did have time. His temporal existence in that bar had seemingly always existed and was not about to end.",16,AntiAntiJokes.csv

"In 1884, Sir Pennington Blackmore sat down in the smoking lounge of his local gentleman's club.","Looking through the contents of the *Evening Standard* his eyes were drawn to a rather alluring advertisment in the classifieds.""Lady Wentworth bids all gentleman callers to stop by the Rolling Rickshaw for cards, conversation, and knowing glances.

A man is lost in a forest...,"He whips around at the sound of crunching behind him. His eyes go wide as he freezes in place, petrified. Shit, I though I lost it… He thinks to himself. His mind races as he frantically searches for a place to hide, or a weapon, or anything to help him out of this desperate situation in which he has unfortunately got himself stuck in. How did this happen? He wonders to himself, for it would be quite weird to wonder to someone else, seeing as he is by himself. He realizes that running is his only chance of escaping ""it"". He didn't know what ""it"" was but it didn't look friendly. It could be friendly though. I, the narrator, haven't specified so he doesn't know yet. The sand flips up behind him as he sprints through the desert. He loses his balance and stumbles  forward, almost tumbling over.

An academic walks into a bar and orders a portion of fries.,"""Sure,"" says the bartender ""and what would you like to dri-""""I always cite my sauces"" interrupts the academic staring icily into the bartender's eyes.""Well, all the sauces are already on the table, so there's no-""""Ketchup, Mustard, Gravy."" interrupts the academic, darkening around the eyes, ""2057. *Hollandaise, Salad Cream, Sriracha*. Worcestershire: HP and Brown.""The bartender waits patiently for the academic to finish, but inwardly her spirits begin to fall. All her career she had been building towards her first appearance in an antiantijoke. No one had handed her anything on a plate: she had started with a regular joke, and worked her way gradually upwards through years of hard graft. But to come all this way just to be the foil for a derivative source/sauce pun? Why bother with anything at that point.By this stage the academic is screaming the names of sauces directly into the bartender's face, his thin voice mounting to a consistent train-like whistle. The fluids and tissues in the academic's throat begin to boil and effervesce, and the resulting froth is forced through a mesh of frayed blood vessels, creating a kind of espresso-machine effect. Eventually the academic's body simmers down entirely to produce the rarest sauce of all: a perfectly reduced 2057 sauce.Even though all the elements required to justify the punchline are now in place, the bartender wanders aimlessly out into the street, leaving the bar empty except for the academics Johannes Ketchup, Emery Mustard and Geert Gravy, co-authors of the paradigm shifting monograph ""Hollandaise, Salad Cream, Sriracha,"" first published in 2057 by the Worcestershire-based publishing house HP and Brown.Outside the bar, the bartender soon wanders into the part of the setting that isn't necessary to narrate the joke and dissipates beneath a moon that seems to divide itself into eight pieces before her eyes.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->Dear author,>While we were initially pleased to see our work *Hollandaise, Salad Cream, Sriracha* referenced in a context outside our narrow academic circle, we resent what we feel to be the implication that citing our work is in some sense inherently comedic due to its title. At the time of publication, *Hollandaise, Salad Cream, Sriracha* represented a radical departure from existing scholarship in the field, and its central thesis, that a precise global balance of savoury, sour and piquant condiments is required to prevent the moon from fragmenting, is one that has received a commensurate degree of serious attention in the intervening years.>Furthermore, as the subject of the joke is ostensibly the correct attribution of sources, we were disappointed to see our work cited incompletely. For future reference the correct citation for the current edition is as follows:>Ketchup, J., Mustard, E. and Gravy. G. 2057. *Hollandaise, Salad Cream, Sriracha*. 3rd ed. Worcestershire: HP and Brown.>We do not ask that you remove or edit the reference, as we understand that a degree of creative license is sometimes required to make a joke function, however we do ask that you include this letter in full alongside the joke in accordance with our right to reply.>Warmest regards,>Dr. Johannes Ketchup, Technical University of Pretoria>Dr. Emery Mustard, United States Naval Academy at Annapolis>Dr. Geert Gravy, Université Flamande de Gand---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------After reviewing the letter three times and making several superficial changes to the wording, Dr. Johannes Ketchup added his own signature above those of his colleagues and pressed send on his futuristic electronic fax machine. The fax machine did not seem futuristic to Dr. Johannes Ketchup as he had purchased it five years previously, in the year 2056, but it is futuristic from the perspective of the time of writing.Sending the strongly worded letter of complaint made Dr. Ketchup feel briefly important and intelligent. But despite being an immensely important and intelligent man, Dr. Ketchup lacked the awareness to realise that his letter was not an addendum to a joke, but rather an integral part of it. Nor that his entire life was delimited by the boundaries of that same ongoing joke.Instead, the suspicion that his life was a joke haunted the peripheries of his consciousness, only coming to the surface in the form of a transient irritability which he took out indirectly on his wife and young son.Feeling his mood darken again, he began to run himself a warm bath in his ornate Greco-Roman bathtub, but the converging gravitational forces from the eight fragments of the moon caused the water to rise in an eerie pillar in the centre of the room.Still more distracted, he stormed into the nursery where, without understanding why, he struck his sleeping son violently on the head with his cane.The boy, in turn, sat bolt upright in bed and said, ""*Orange* you glad I didn't say *Mayonnaise*?"" as the blow had damaged the Wernicke's area of his brain.",149,AntiAntiJokes.csv
A leaf walks into a bar...,"“CREEEAAAAK,” the squeaky, rotten floor board groans. The leaf glances beneath it in shock while the swinging doors swing swingily behind it. All movement and sound ceases dramatically as everyone slowly turns to look up at the leaf. It was at this point that the leaf realized that it was in fact in a rootin’ tootin’ cowboy shootin’ saloon rather than the expected bar. The leaf was quite surprised when it came to this conclusion as it did not notice this when it first walked in and looked at the sign. This can be attributed to the fact that leaves cannot read. The leaf slowly took in the room around it, soaking up the dark and dingy atmosphere whilst taking note of the undeniably evil group in the corner. This menacing bunch will end up being entirely irrelevant to the overall plot despite being the main antagonists. This does not matter, however, as the leaf is unaware of what an antagonist is due to the fact that it is a leaf and cannot be bothered with trivial matters such as this. The leaf began to saunter unhurriedly towards the bartender. ""What's your joke about Leaf?"" He inquires, providing the first bit of dialogue in the whole story. ""I don't quite know yet,"" the leaf replies, ""But I do know that constantly being forced to play the same role in jokes must get exceedingly boring for you."" ""Welp, only the great narrator knows what the outcome of the joke will be until he tells it again, repeatedly."" The man responds, entirely ignoring the second part of the leaf’s comment for no apparent reason.The narrator suddenly remembers that they are in a saloon""HEY LEAFY!"" One of the cowboys shouts, in all caps, ""What are you doing in my saloon?"" The leaf whirled around at the sound of the voice and searched intently for the speaker. Upon locating the culprit, the leaf walked out into the center of the room. The leaf didn't know how to answer that question. It was there because the great narrator put it there. Since the leaf couldn't answer, it didn't. This caused the lone cowboy to become angered and whip out his six shooter. Flabbergasted at the mahoosive kerfuffle that the cowboy had caused, the leaf decided to end his life. The leaf reached down and drew for its iron. It whips the boomstick out of the leather case and squeezes the trigger.PAP PAP PAP!!!! All is quiet as the man slowly falls towards the floor. But what is that?

Three pies walk into a bar,"The bartender asks, ""Is everyone here an apple pie?""The first pie says ""I don't know.""The second pie says ""I don't know.""The third pie says ""No.""""So what kind of pie are you?"" asks the bartender.""I'm an apple pie.""""Wait, so then every one of you is an apple pie!"" exclaimed the bartender.""You're not an apple pie,"" said the third pie to the bartender. ""You're a skeleton.""""That's not...how could you possibly have had such a brazen misinterpretation of my question? The other pies seemed to understand.""""Please forgive my friends,"" said the third pie. ""They're not logicians.""In rage, the skeleton bartender ate all three pies. The pies then went to heaven, and met Saint Peter at the pearly gates.""Are all of *you* apple pies?"" asked Saint Peter, mindful of his language after witnessing six thousand years of worldly sin.The first pie says ""I don't know.""The second pie says ""I don't know.""The third pie says ""How can you idiots not know?

An escaped convict crawls into a penthouse,"through an air vent, wearing dusty clothes and covered in soot. She stands up, coughing, and scans the room nervously. Numerous large monitors decorate the dark walls of the hall, and at the other end is a massive window, offering a fantastic view of the Shadow Realm and all of its floating islands and skies. Before the window stands a figure, draped with a long, ornate velvet robe, gazing at the view silently and without motion.The convict, who I should probably mention is Clie Nt, approaches the figure apprehensively. Though her footsteps clearly echo around the penthouse, the figure seems to be deliberately ignoring them. *Is this Him?* Clie wonders.""Evening."" His soft voice reverberates in the hall. What terrible acoustics.Clie freezes in place. ""Uh… evening?""He draws a deep breath, but still keeps his gaze fixed on the window. ""I trust that you've something to discuss.""""Well, yes. Kind of. I've been asked to deliver a warning.""The figure turns around. Clie isn't sure what face she expected him to have, but she is nonetheless baffled. His face is human. Beautifully human and innocent. The most distinct feature about it, doubtless, is his eyes, which boast a lovely golden color, an immaculate shade reminiscent of a whispering field of wheat bathed in the beams of a winter sunset. How droll.His eyes vaguely widen at the sight of her. ""Clie Nt. Curious. You, of all people, I did not expect to find here.""""Er… Do I know you?""""I presume not. But I have heard much about you."" He steps across the penthouse towards one of the monitors, beneath which a keyboard appears. He types something on it, and the screen fills with small text, scrolling up and down and shifting about. ""These are your tales. And I think we are in yet another one.""""Well… who are you, then?""He directs his yellow gaze to her. ""I am the one known as the Shadow Master. I am the ruler of this world. But that is less important—tell me, Clie, what warning have you come to deliver?""""It's about… the Ordinaryman. And how you have to destroy him.""""The Ordinaryman? Hmm."" He walks over to another monitor and types something else into it. Some more text appears on the screen, which he takes a moment to read. ""I see. A rogue character, convinced that he is real. How bemusing."" He leaves the monitor and ambles back to the center of the room, to submerge himself in the view of his kingdom.Clie raises an eyebrow. ""Well? Are you going to destroy him?""The Shadow Master sighs. ""Clie, I get requests all the time, about all kinds of things. When people are desperate, they come to me. Perhaps they see in me a mere last resort.""He gestures at a large drawer in the wall. Clie approaches it warily and pulls it open, revealing the corpse of a beautiful woman upon whose chest a bloody pentagram has been carved. Clie recoils in horror. ""What the hell?!""""Indeed. This is just one of many 'sacrifices' I have been offered by some overworld organization. Their request is always the same: 'Contumeliis afficiunt Xakh'ath'akh'arus.'""""Xakh'ath'akh'arus… I know that name.""""Yes, it should be familiar. But these requests are not from your time—they date back to far earlier than when Xakh'ath'akh'arus first appears. Somehow, they had predicted what was to come, and asked me to destroy it.""""But you didn't.""He says nothing.""Why?""""Because I am not God. I am not the Author. I do not dictate what happens beyond my domain. The Shadow Realm is mine, and nothing else is.""""But… the fate of the world relies on it! You *have* to destroy the Ordinaryman, or all is doomed! Isn't it?""He chuckles half-heartedly. ""No. It isn't. That would be exciting, though, would it not? Defectus likes to pretend that his world lives on its own. That he can surrender control and watch its timeline go on without him. He created this dimension, too, and gave its command to me—as if it made any difference. He says he has no control over this realm, but that is not true; even these words that I speak, and the words that you speak, and everything that surrounds us—it's all his.""""So why does he do it? Why does he pretend that his work is alive if it so clearly isn't? And if he truly makes everything, as well as the words you just said, why does it seem as if he's now admitting that it's all fake?""""I fear I know not the answer. Perhaps it is for his own amusement. Perhaps for the amusement of others. Perhaps this is just something to distract him from his otherwise uneventful and dull life. Perhaps he wants people to like him. Perhaps this is the only medium of storytelling he feels comfortable with. Perhaps he's not competent at anything, and this is the only way he can both admit it and continue talking. I don't know. It's all open to interpretation."" He sighs deeply. ""That being said, I've made a promise. If I do find the Ordinaryman lurking around the Shadow Realm, I shall surely send him to ​.""""To… to what?""""​.""""Are you saying something? I can't tell.""""Indeed. ​ is a rather peculiar place; it is, in fact, nothingness. The nature of its nothingness, however, is remarkable—​ spreads at a very slow rate, and yet anything and everything it touches becomes part of it. There is no escape from ​; once you go in, you're not coming out. Simple as that. Allow me to demonstrate.""He walks over to yet another monitor, where instead of black text on a white background, live footage of a large dinosaur asleep on a hillside is displayed on the screen. ""This is Rex the Tyrannosaurus. Earlier today, he slaughtered an innocent herbivore and devoured its carcass. As retribution, I shall send him to ​. Observe.""The Shadow Master performs an odd gesture with his hands, and a brief snapping sound is heard. When Clie returns her gaze to the monitor, the dinosaur has vanished from the hillside.""Now, here is ​,"" he says, pressing a button on the keyboard. The view of the hillside is replaced by a transparent background, through which the back of the monitor can be seen. The figure of the same sleeping dinosaur appears in the center, but it soon begins evaporating at an accelerating rate, its body breaking apart faster and faster into nothingness, until, mere seconds later, it is completely gone, and all that remains is a blank screen.""Rex is no more."" He presses a button on the keyboard and the screen turns black. ""That shall be the fate of the Ordinaryman, as well, if he is to set foot in my kingdom.""""Hmm. Isn't that cruel?""""That is up to Defectus to decide. He is the one making these decisions.""""Does that truly exempt you from your moral obligations, though?""""Perhaps. I am not one to judge.""

A scullion walks into a bar...,"*Narrator's commentary: At this point in the joke I should make it clear that I do not know what a scullion is, and I did not have time to do adequate research while writing. I receive draft outlines from [u/O_m_O](https://old.reddit.com/user/O_______m_______O/) at 9am EST and am expected to deliver a fully narrated joke by 12pm GMT the same day. The outlines I receive are, frankly, garbage. Barely literate. They contain sentences like ""Bartender is joke's boss"". I typically have to do about 85-90% of the writing myself.*>The scullion walks into the kitchen and orders a long high one straight up.*Narrator's commentary: according to the Oxford English Dictionary a scullion is a form of low ranking servant, although it could just as easily be a misspelling of ""scallion"" (a type of green onion). The context does not help clarify this at all as both a scullion and a scallion would be normally found in a kitchen.*>The bartender says*Narrator's commentary: why is the bartender working in the kitchen? I suspect the author may have already forgotten the context established in the previous sentence.*>""sure thing, Tony,"" and bicycle kicks a tall glass in a high arc through the air, which the scullion expertly controls with his feet.*Narrator's commentary: at this point I now strongly suspect that the joke is actually about the Gaelic footballer Tony Scullion.*>The bartender then withdraws his trusty rapier, and slices the scullion into 1 cm pieces, discarding the tougher green section, and using the trimmings to garnish the glass, which fills with a dark broth.*Narrator's commentary: I'm not hugely proud of my writing in this next section, but in my defence it's worth noting that the prompt for this whole section of the joke is literally just the words ""improvise scullion pun (with tuna)"".*>""Avast, you rapscullion,"" says the bartender, his baritone voice rich with tuna.*Narrator's commentary: I was initially hesitant to include the following sentence, both because it bears almost no connection to the preceding content, and because it is very obviously plagiarised word for word from another post which is still on the front page at the time of writing. Nevertheless I include it here because without it the joke would simply end on the word ""tuna"", and because it was the only part of the draft that was written out in full sentences.*>""A ship's captain knows its crew,"" the skeleton bartender said, turning towards the camera and winking.*Concluding commentary: There isn't really much more to say at this point, other than that if these comments appear in the final version it will confirm my long-held suspicion that [u/O_m_O](https://old.reddit.com/user/O_______m_______O/) does not read, let alone edit, anything I send before posting.*",14,AntiAntiJokes.csv

Before serving in World War IV, my ship served in World War III. It took four thousand years to reach the hypergiant VY Canis Majoris where the final battle was fought over an alien world. It took another four thousand years to make the journey home, which means I'm at least eight thousand and twenty three years old!""The bartender shook his head, and gestured to his PhD diploma in Physics hung proudly on the wall behind an empty whiskey bottle. ""That's eight thousand years on Earth, but due to relativistic effects, you would have only aged two or three years, which means you're still in your twenties, if that.""The anchor let out sigh. ""Alright, fine. I'm actually only twenty. I only fought in World War IV for three years before the ship was sunk. I was just...*yanking your chain*.""The bartender then tried to evict the anchor from his bar, but was unable, because the anchor was still attached to its ship, which was the bar.

Oh, no. Not you again.The train is now plated in plot armor, and as such it and its passengers cannot be harmed any further.The economist looks about in confusion. ""Where's Jerry? He was just here a moment ago, wasn't he?""""I… don't recall,"" the logician responds.The economist sighs and sticks a cigarette between his lips. His eyes wander beyond the window, where the pastures of Scotland whiz by. *What a wonderful place*, he thinks to himself. *I almost wish I could stay here, and leave everything behind in England. It would be nice to have a fresh start.*The logician, who no longer has a crush on the economist as it didn't advance the story that much, picks up her newspaper. ""I'm going outside for a bit, alright?""""What for?"" the economist asks absentmindedly.""Just a breather. I'll be back in a jiffy.""""Aight.""The logician stands up and walks across the carriage. Barring these two passengers, the train is utterly vacant; not a soul occupies any of the other padded seats. This was the state of the train when the logician and the economist first boarded it in Liverpool, and so it did not bother them too much. They did, of course, realize the joke-setup-like nature of the situation, and duly prepared themselves for the punchline. But after they spotted that cow, nothing happened. Life went on as usual. The logician almost felt disappointed, but she wasn't sure what to expect—perhaps, to some degree, she just wanted it all to end. For the punchline to be delivered, then her existence erased. Or just to be of some use to some grander co(s)mic being.She leaves the carriage and walks outside onto an open platform. Leaning against the metal guard rails, she breathes deep of the fresh Scottish air and opens her newspaper. The headlines, as usual, give some eye-catching, absurd, even ridiculous impressions:&nbsp;###ALABAMA MAN INVENTS TIME TRAVEL, BECOMES OWN FATHER&nbsp;###80% OF YORK DESTROYED FOLLOWING MASSIVE PUB EXPLOSION&nbsp;###T-REX PROTESTS AGAINST CLAPPING, CLAIMS ""ABLEISM, RACISM, SEXISM, NAZISM, COMMUNISM, HOMOPHOBIA""&nbsp;###HORSE WALKS INTO BAR.

That's all it reads. Below that, a short summary:**Listen. I haven't much time to explain. You're not going to Scotland. I need a favor from you, and I'm sorry I didn't ask earlier.** ***More at page 15.***She hastily turns to page 15, where the headline **LISTEN** appears once again at the top, and beneath it:**When you make the turn, I ask of you to burn this paper. No matter who or what you meet next, tell them nothing of this. They do not appreciate me, for whatever reason. Thus, you are my only connection to this place. I will not guide you further than this, but I will keep an eye on you and do my best to reveal the light.****Now, I must confess that I have lied to you.

She runs back into the carriage whence she came.""Kevin!"" she shouts, but the economist has vanished, leaving behind only a lit cigarette on the silver table.She drops the newspaper and runs back outside, and the sky is now tinted somewhere between purple and green. The rain pours mercilessly on the train, almost seeming to tilt it off-course ever so slightly. Clie hurries forward through the empty carriages, until at last she arrives at the locomotive, which to her surprise is also empty. She peers through the front windows—the sky is now a bright orange, and the thunders shake the carriage from side to side. Thinking quickly, Clie turns on the wipers and sees in the distance—What?!It's a turn. An impossible turn. It's indescribable. It's as if the turn points to some angle that is beyond our three dimensions. Clie rubs her eyes in disbelief. It hurts just to look at it.But it's getting closer, and closer, and closer.The sky scrolls through a myriad of colors, and the raindrops become the size of footballs. The train oscillates to inconceivable angles. The turn is getting closer.Oh god.Clie braces herself. The sky no longer exists. Each raindrop is an ocean of its own.

I’m currently with another woman. Please, don’t make this any harder than it has to be.”The woman struggles to understand most of his reply, but she tries to cover this fact up, for fear of embarrassment. So she says, “Okay, whatever you want, dear.”The blind man, Noah Deere, replies “Oh sure, use that tone with me. But let me tell you something, Sharon. I never loved you. I don’t care what happens to you. Goodbye.” He proceeds out of the house, never to look back.Sharon, though, had been pouring herself another glass, unaware that he had replied or left the house. So she didn’t hear the sirens outside, nor did she answer the door when the paramedics knocked. Instead, she was passed out on the kitchen floor.Sharon never heard from Noah again, having Noidear that it was due to his shortsightedness.

""Just give me a fucking whiskey, ya cunt!""""Aight man, it's your funeral,"" says the bartender, pouring a glass of fine whiskey.With sunlight flooding the establishment, the alcoholic again walks through the door, looking even more disheveled. ""Sweet mother of Christ, what did I tell you?!""""I apologize candidly, sir. You keep doubling your promise each time, and I'm incapable of feeling any remorse; I'm in this purely for monetary gain, you see.""""Well then, just so you know, whenever that version of me walks in here offering to up the ante, he's lying. Don't trust him.""""Right. But, uh, I'm only gonna do that if you double the price again.""""Urgh, fine. Whatever. Sixteen hundred, is it?""""Indeed. Nice doing business with you.""The alcoholic walks outside again, seeming a little more cheered up.By eventide of the morrow, as expected, the alcoholic bursts through the wall of the bar, sending dust and debris to every corner of the room. He leaps to the counter and screeches, ""WHERE'S ME FUCKING USQUE YE DOBBER?!""The bartender sighs. ""Nope. Can't.""""GIVE IT TO ME! NOW!""""I've been told not to trust you.""""THIRTY-TWO HUNDRED QUID! SIXTY-FOUR! ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT! TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY-SIX!

The crazed alcoholic pulls out a revolver and, with a swift motion, sets it against the bartender's temple. The bartender begins sweating nervously. ""This is all very simple, Mr. Pollington,"" says the lunatic. ""You serve me a whiskey, I walk out of here without leaving a trace. You refuse, and… well, someone'll have to clean up that mess."" He pushes the revolver deeper into the flesh, and the bartender restrains a gasp between his labored breaths. ""Now, I don't know which one you personally wish to pick, Mr. Pollington, but I know that your wife will be very happy to hear you didn't choose the latter. Either way, I'd suggest making your move right about now.""The bartender sends a shaking hand towards a glass, fills it to the brim with strong, harsh whiskey, and places it on the counter.""Ah,"" the alcoholic says, retrieving the gun to his pocket. ""Wise choice, Mr. Pollington. Very wise indeed."" He gulps down the drink and throws it onto the floor, where it shatters into a thousand shards. ""Another.""The bartender, visibly shaken, pours him another glass and sets it on the counter. The alcoholic once again quaffs it in a blink of the eye, then smashes it into the floor. ""Another!""He suppresses a whimper as he pours the maniac a third whiskey, which he again downs instantly and smashes into the floor. ""Another one, Mr. Pollington!""Ten or twelve shots later, the floor is nearly covered in broken glass. The bartender is whimpering, and the alcoholic is laughing maniacally, smashing the glasses and watching the bartender dance behind the counter like a circus monkey, ferreting about for whiskey bottles.""I… oh my god, I… I've run out, sir. I've no more whiskey left,"" the bartender whimpers after a few more rounds.""Hmm,"" the alcoholic mutters, now much more wobbly than before. ""Very well then. You've been a… good, er… yeah."" He turns around and stumbles across the bar. ""I'll be sure to… come arou—"" The alcoholic retches, then throws up on the glass-covered floor. He wipes the vomit from his lips and heads on into the dark streets of the night.The bartender, fatigued and terrified, steps to the side then collapses.When he wakes up, the bar is still empty, the night is still dark and the floor is still covered in dust, vomit and broken glass. The bartender gets on his quivering feet with a grunt and checks the time. It's 4:37 AM. He scrambles to the telephone on the wall and dials frantically.""911, what is your emergency?""""I… There was a man here, a few hours ago. He threatened me with a gun, and, and…""""*No.*""""P-pardon?""""*Let's try again.*""&nbsp;An alcoholic walks into a bar. He hobbles over to the counter and stares at the bartender, a tear welling in his left eye. ""Sir, you must help me. I'm in a terrible condition—alcohol is ruining my life in every way imaginable. You know your spirits, good man; surely you know the solution to all this!""The bartender's eyes brighten, and a smile curls his wrinkled face. He crouches behind the counter and pulls out a tiny cubic capsule, no more than a millimeter in radius. ""One cubic micrometer,"" he says, shaking the capsule. ""A trillionth of a milliliter; around four-fifths of a picogram of pure, distilled, unadulterated antialcohol."" He pours a small glass of whiskey and places it on the counter. ""When in contact with a similar amount of alcohol…"" He drops the capsule into the liquid, which after a few moments acquires a soft white glow. ""…the two should annihilate and emit about… 34 calories worth of radiant energy.""The alcoholic eyes him, confused.""E=mc².""""Oh. I see.""The bartender pulls out a bowl filled with these capsules. ""All you have to do is swallow these pills every so often and your alcoholism should gradually evaporate, like, uh, fine wine.""The alcoholic grabs the bowl and places it in his pocket. ""Thank you so much! I-I don't know how I could ever repay—""""A hundred dollars.""""Ah, yes, that should do."" He slides a one hundred dollar bill across the counter and leaves the bar, satisfied.The next day, the alcoholic returns to the bar, looking distressed. The bartender raises an eyebrow. ""Well?""""Hmm?""""Did they work?""""Oh, yes. Wonderfully. I no longer crave alcohol, not even the slightest. The antialcohol did its job immaculately, but, er… well…"" He pulls up his shirt, revealing a bright light shining through his stomach. ""I just can't get enough of 'em. I'm afraid my addiction has simply transformed into antialcoholism. I understand you've some solution to this plight as well?""""Well, surely!"" The bartender pulls out a glass filled with a transparent, viscuous liquid. ""One pint,"" he says, shaking the glass. ""An eighth of a gallon; around four-elevenths of a kilogram of pure, distilled, unadulterated antiantialcohol."" He grabs another glass, one filled with capsules of antialcohol, and places it on the counter. ""When in contact with a similar amount of antialcohol…"" He pours the antiantialcohol into the second glass, which very quickly shines a brilliant white glow that only grows brighter and brighter with time. ""…the two should annihilate and emit about… uh… what is it… three megatons of TNT?""""Three… *three megatons of TNT?!*""The light emanating from the glass turns blinding, and a hot aura manifests around it.""No, no, sorry—*six* megatons of TNT. 'Cause you're counting both the antialcohol and the antiantialcohol.""The glass shatters, and the liquid inside seethes and levitates into the air.""Are you… are you being serious?!""""Quite so. I have just placed both of us in immediate mortal danger, which we have little to no chance of eluding. I'm inclined to offer an apology, but as I said before, I am incapable of feeling any remorse.""The counter is engulfed in flames, and a red hue paints the corners of the room.""What? When did you say that?""""Oh, you're not the same guy? Sorry, let me explain:""And so, during the next two seconds, the bartender hastily tells:""An alcoholic walks into a bar. He hobbles over to the counter and stares at the bartender, a tear welling in his left eye. 'Listen, sir. I know you are a good man.

Although, I guess I can make an exception this time.""*Audience cheers*The bar then drank a small amount of its cocktail, immediately dying right afterwards. As this happened, a blue beret from the United Nations peackeeping forces walked in and arrested the bartender. See, the bartender was actually Bashar al-assad and the cocktails were chemical weapons. *Audience starts to support american intervention in syria*The blue beret walks Bashar al-assad into a restaraunt and asks a waiter for a glass of H20.

The glasses then immediately decay, giving everybody in the restaraunt cancer. This allows the UN to add nuclear weapon charges to the long list of crimes committed by assad. *Audience decides to abandon kurdish population and do nothing about syria*However, the United nation's power now days is mostly symbolic, so the united nations peacekeeper wasn't a peacekeeper at all.

The Story of Socrates,"Socrates furrowed his brow as he walked, patrolling the city square of Athens like he did every day, looking for new students to teach philosophy to. He taught his students by asking them questions that made them uncomfortable, forcing them to come to terms with their own ignorance, in the pursuit of Truth. After walking a while, he came across a Greek youth sitting on the steps of a bakery. Socrates prepared his line of questioning, and approached the boy.""Young man,"" said Socrates, ""do your parents know you're gay""In this question lies the brilliance of Socrates' ""Socratic Method."" The boy cannot answer the question directly, because to do so would be to accept the underlying premise, that he is gay.The boy saw through this, however, and rebutted, speaking quickly:""stupididiotsayswhat""""Hmm?"" said Socrates""dumboldguysayswhat""""Huh?"" said Socrates.""bigfattysayswhat""""I didn't catch that,"" said Socrates.

Neither, they both rely on the infernal cycle of life and death. These future chickens will be locked up into tiny coups and experience only suffering for their entire miserable existence, wishing for the day that they will be slaughtered and turned into meat"" I said, basquing in the look of horror on the spaniard's face as he saw my sadistic glee.> > As the spaniard heard me speak, they started to charge at me, extra egg in hand. In the heat of the moment I picked up a gallon of milk to defend myself with.*Unfortuanately, the notebooks of Cide Hamete Benengeli do not contain the rest of this battle.*The incomplete story of the spaniard and the eggs plays a major part in the catalan festival of *Straußenei*. Every child in the county has to hard boil an egg, and the child who has the hardest egg is named the *eggchild*. The eggchild then gets to choose a spaniard, and by catalonian custom, the spaniard has to sit on the egg child's father, the *eggman*. However, the eggman can decide to pass this duty on to another catalonian for the price of one emerald. After the spaniard sits on the eggman, the spaniard must slaughter two chickens in any manner the eggchild wishes. Any spaniard that does not go along with this tradition is summarily tarred and feathered.The first time I went to a Straußenei the story of the spaniard and the eggs enamored me. I simply could not get it out of my head, and I knew that with my archaelogical education that I was destined to find the rest of the story. My studies told me that the story originated in the dead sea - the cradle of civilization. So I brought the largest egg I could find to the dead sea and dropped it in. Each time I took a salty drink from the lifeless waters I saw a new crack form, and out of the crack, blinding light. I drank up the waters, faster and faster, until there was nothing left except a giant glowing ball of light from what used to be an egg.I was so close to absolution, but just then I found my fatal mistake.

He stammers, then gets up and shows her the way to the emergency room.""Doctor!"" cries the receptionist.There's no doctor here, but a nearby male nurse is happy to help. ""What is it, Clint?""""This woman has a terrible condition!"" He motions towards the woman, his eyes glancing at her beautiful boobs.The nurse takes a careful look at her, then nods. ""Very well. Please, Clint, close the door on your way out.""The receptionist leaves the room and closes the door. The nurse turns to the woman. ""Please, ma'am, uh... lie down on the... er, bed."" His eyes can't help but wander towards the woman's luscious tits every few seconds.The woman, conveniently unaware of this, lies down on the bed with her legs spread at a perfect 30° angle. *Wow*, thinks the nurse. *What precision!* He sighs within his thoughts. *My wife is gonna kill me…*He walks up to the bed and gazes into the woman's azure eyes, which stare back at his hazel ones intently. He sifts her ravishing blonde hair through his warm fingers. ""Ma'am,"" he whispers professionally, ""what is your condition?""""My condition,"" she whispers professionally, ""is that I'm too beautiful for this world."" Sorry, I misjudged. She *is* aware of her beauty. She runs a finger across the nurse's lips.""You're right,"" he whispers very professionally. ""You *are* too beautiful for this world."" He snatches a scalpel and jabs it into her flat chest, then begins carving a pentagram onto the flesh.""Ahhh!"" she moans as the blood splashes about the room, forming a puddle on the bedside. ""Oh god, not like this!"" The nurse continues the ritual, only stopping occasionally to wipe the sweat from his forehead.A few minutes after the shape is complete, the woman's flailing turns from vague to slow to suspended, and she lies on the bed motionless, her gorgeous face frozen forevermore in an eternal state of distress. The nurse clears his throat, then pulls up his sleeve to reveal the shape of an hourglass, chiseled deep into his forearm. He presses it and nearly cries from the pain, yet he grits his teeth and stares on.""**CONTUMELIIS AFFICIUNT XAKH'ATH'AKH'ARUS!**""The woman vaporizes and her ravaging body is sent to the Shadow Realm, where it is processed for further evaluation. *Hopefully*, the nurse thinks to himself as he grabs a mop from the shelf, *He shall deem her an adequate sacrifice, and bring about the prophecy.*",324,AntiAntiJokes.csv

"One gelid night, a pilgrim stumbled into a wise sage's tent.","Having forgotten the path and rambling without aim for a while, the pilgrim asked the old man for directions to the closest town.The sage smiled. ""My child, I see that you are afraid to be alone. Come, sit with me.""The pilgrim huddled next to the old man, shivering. He was surprised to see that the man had not worn much more than a ragged piece of cloth draped around his body. ""Sir, if I might ask, how can you deal with this climate while wearing such simple clothing?""The sage smiled. ""It is easy, my child. Travelers like you are much like horses—they can walk afoot for miles upon miles, and yet they only feel the need for comfort when they stand still.""The pilgrim, having never interacted with horses that much, deemed this analogy believable. ""So how do you do it? You sit still all day and all night in your tent, and yet the cold never bothers you.""The sage smiled. ""Oh, but you see, my friend, I do move…"" He tapped at his temple. ""In here. My mind is always wandering from place to place, from notion to notion, and thus I never feel the bite of cold.""""What about food? Water? Love? Fraternity? All those things humans need to be human? Surely you cannot satisfy them within the confines of this tiny tent.""The sage smiled. ""Food and water and love and fraternity are beautiful things, my friend, but they are not what separates man from animal. Cows need food and water; birds can feel love; and bees build hives where fraternity flourishes. But a bee does not stop on a flower and move its gaze to the heavens as it ponders who made it—that, my dear friend, is the burden of man.""""How long have you been sitting here?"" asked the pilgrim, shifting to a more comfortable position.The sage smiled. ""I love you.""""W… what?""The sage smiled. ""I know we've only just now met and we haven't talked very much, and yet I can't help but feel a deep bond between us.""The pilgrim gaped at him momentarily, but soon he realized he, too, felt something. ""I… I think I know what you mean.""The sage smiled. He placed his hands on the pilgrim's shoulders and stared longingly into his eyes. The pilgrim returned the gesture, then leaned forward. They French-kissed for what felt like hours, hours that felt so warm and cosy. The pilgrim felt safe within the old man's grasp—he wanted to never let go.Their lips eventually parted, then the old man began taking the cloth off his body. The pilgrim removed his clothes, his heart pounding restlessly.###THE NEXT DAYThe pilgrim opened his eyes slowly, his naked body still brimming with love and passion. The old man's hot arms were wrapped around him. They both lay under a thin blanket the pilgrim pulled from his backpack the night before. The sun peeked over the horizon, showering them with golden rays of light. For the first time in forever, the pilgrim felt safe.The sage smiled. ""Good morning, my child.""The pilgrim rolled around. ""Morning."" He couldn't help but smile back.The sage smiled. He got out of the blanket and stood on his feet with a sexy grunt, his backside 'accidentally' turned to the pilgrim. It was so hot. He picked up his cloth and threw it on his body. The pilgrim grabbed his clothes and hastily dressed up.""One night that was,"" the pilgrim chuckled.The sage smiled. ""I understand that you must go now, my child.""He nodded grimly. ""I'll be sure to stop by in the future, though.""The sage smiled. ""Take care, friend.""And with that, the pilgrim took off and resumed his adventure to the great Kaaba. He vowed to keep the old man in his heart forevermore, and in his return to search for him however long should it take, no matter how hungry or cold or lonely he felt. He must never stop walking, not until he finds him again. Then he may rest.The sage smiled.",3,AntiAntiJokes.csv

Since an atom consists of at least one electron, that means that after some time that electron will come to an end. So after some time there will be no electrons, as that electron is the only one in the universe.But all of our electricity is based on electrons, so that means at some point we will no longer have any electricity, and therefore no reddit.

What was that mysterious sound????,"A man is driving down the road and his car breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?""The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound.............................................................................................But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.By some weird chance that you REALLY are a monk, feel free to pm me and i shall tell you what the sound was. Have a nice day!",253,rjokes.csv

Environmental Impact ??,"An older downtown YMCA had the funds and long wanted to expand but it could not because none of the adjacent properties, not even a long closed gas station, had been for sale.  Then, one late winter morning, the Y’s director noticed a new “for sale” sign on the gas station. Immediately she phoned the listed number and the Y’s board members, got the ball rolling and within a week they’d purchased the property. Some weeks passed, long drawn up plans were put into action and the ground-breaking took place just as the spring weather arrived.  But, not too long into the project, the excavation came to a sudden halt as the crew reported that the bottom of a trench was filling with what appeared and smelled like a mix of stale gasoline and diesel.  The obvious conclusion was that there were old, abandoned storage tanks on the site that would require a very expensive environmental cleanup.  Consultants and lawyers got involved and, of course, the previous owners of the gas station denied any such thing and suggested that what the construction crew had seen was really nothing more than dirty groundwater filling the hole. “But” protested the Y’s lawyer, referring to a consultant’s report, “The Y’s men say only fuels rush in…..”",0,rjokes.csv
