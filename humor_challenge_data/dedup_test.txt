(ok maybe it's not a "joke", but it sure is funny) If you can read this whole story without laughing then there's no hope for you. I was crying by the end. Note: Please take time to read this slowly. If you pay attention to the first two judges, the reaction of the third judge is even better. For those of you who have lived in Texas , you know how true this is. They actually have a Chili Cook-off about the time Halloween comes around. It takes up a major portion of a parking lot at the San Antonio City Park . Judge #3 was an inexperienced Chili taster named Frank, who was visiting from Springfield , IL .Frank: "Recently, I was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook-off. The original person called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking for directions to the Coors Light truck, when the call came in. I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy and, besides, they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted".Here are the scorecard notes from the event:CHILI # 1 - MIKE'S MANIAC MONSTER CHILI...Judge # 1 -- A little too heavy on the tomato. Amusing kick. Judge # 2 -- Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild. Judge # 3 (Frank) -- Holy shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. Took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that's the worst one. These Texans are crazy.CHILI # 2 - AUSTIN 'S AFTERBURNER CHILI...Judge # 1 -- Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight jalapeno tang. Judge # 2 -- Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously. Judge # 3 -- Keep this out of the reach of children. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face.CHILI # 3 - FRED'S FAMOUS BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILI...Judge # 1 -- Excellent firehouse chili. Great kick. Judge # 2 -- A bit salty, good use of peppers. Judge # 3 -- Call the EPA. I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back, now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced from all of the beer.CHILI # 4 - BUBBA'S BLACK MAGIC...Judge # 1 -- Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing. Judge # 2 -- Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili. Judge # 3 -- I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Is it possible to burn out taste buds? Sally, the beermaid, was standing behind me with fresh refills. That 300-LB woman is starting to look HOT...just like this nuclear waste I'm eating! Is chili an aphrodisiac?CHILI # 5 LISA'S LEGAL LIP REMOVER...Judge # 1 -- Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive. Judge # 2 -- Chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement. Judge # 3 -- My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from the pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning my lips off. It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw those rednecks.CHILI # 6 - VERA'S VERY VEGETARIAN VARIETY...Judge # 1 -- Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spices and peppers. Judge # 2 -- The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic. Superb. Judge # 3 -- My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. I shit on myself when I farted and I'm worried it will eat through the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that Sally. Can't feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone.CHILI # 7 - SUSAN'S SCREAMING SENSATION CHILI..Judge # 1 -- A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers. Judge # 2 -- Ho hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. **I should take note that I am worried about Judge # 3. He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably. Judge # 3 -- You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a thing. I've lost sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava to match my shirt. At least during the autopsy, they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing it's too painful. Screw it; I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my stomach.CHILI # 8 - BIG TOM'S TOENAIL CURLING CHILI...Judge # 1 -- The perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili. Not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence. Judge # 2 -- This final entry is a good, balanced chili. Neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge #3 farted, passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. poor feller, wonder how he'd have reacted to really hot chili? Judge # 3 - No Report <|endoftext|>

A low, unholy gurgle escapes her lips.  Her eyes turn a glassy white and her skin a sallow green.  The other nuns at the table start to stand up and back away, but she throws her head back and a battery of devilish spikes emerge from inside her throat.  They run, but the spikes explode out from the beast, embedding into the bodies of the nuns, the bartender, all the patrons in the crossfire unable to flee.The bartender clutches his impaled shoulder, watching the second and third nuns choke and convulse in front of him.  He feels the toxins course though his own veins and accepts his death.  The fourth nun crawls towards him on all fours, and he can see its jaw unhinge like an angler fish through his blurring vision.  Its putrid breath hits his nostrils.  But suddenly, the First Nun stands up, seemingly unharmed.  She pounces from behind, wrapping a rosary around the neck of the beast, shouting into its ear a prayer the likes of which the bartender has never heard.  The beast screams, and its flesh smokes, and it wrestles and fights for its impure life dragging the First Nun behind the bar.After a moment the First Nun emerges, battered but victorious.  She limps to the still conscious bartender and presses the small whiskey bottle to his lips.  "Not alcohol.  It's antivenom.  Drink."  He obeys.  After a minute he feels fine.  He surveys the destruction around him, the two dead nuns, and despite his gratitude he can't help but ask the one burning question in his mind.He points to the thing behind the bar and asks "what the hell is that?"The First Nun watches as a fifth nun walks into the bar wearing a neatly pressed suit and tie, carrying a briefcase.  "That's Nun of your Business." <|endoftext|>

"Sure," says the bartender "and what would you like to dri-""I always cite my sauces" interrupts the academic staring icily into the bartender's eyes."Well, all the sauces are already on the table, so there's no-""Ketchup, Mustard, Gravy." interrupts the academic, darkening around the eyes, "2057. *Hollandaise, Salad Cream, Sriracha*. Worcestershire: HP and Brown."The bartender waits patiently for the academic to finish, but inwardly her spirits begin to fall. All her career she had been building towards her first appearance in an antiantijoke. No one had handed her anything on a plate: she had started with a regular joke, and worked her way gradually upwards through years of hard graft. But to come all this way just to be the foil for a derivative source/sauce pun? Why bother with anything at that point.By this stage the academic is screaming the names of sauces directly into the bartender's face, his thin voice mounting to a consistent train-like whistle. The fluids and tissues in the academic's throat begin to boil and effervesce, and the resulting froth is forced through a mesh of frayed blood vessels, creating a kind of espresso-machine effect. Eventually the academic's body simmers down entirely to produce the rarest sauce of all: a perfectly reduced 2057 sauce.Even though all the elements required to justify the punchline are now in place, the bartender wanders aimlessly out into the street, leaving the bar empty except for the academics Johannes Ketchup, Emery Mustard and Geert Gravy, co-authors of the paradigm shifting monograph "Hollandaise, Salad Cream, Sriracha," first published in 2057 by the Worcestershire-based publishing house HP and Brown.Outside the bar, the bartender soon wanders into the part of the setting that isn't necessary to narrate the joke and dissipates beneath a moon that seems to divide itself into eight pieces before her eyes.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->Dear author,>While we were initially pleased to see our work *Hollandaise, Salad Cream, Sriracha* referenced in a context outside our narrow academic circle, we resent what we feel to be the implication that citing our work is in some sense inherently comedic due to its title. At the time of publication, *Hollandaise, Salad Cream, Sriracha* represented a radical departure from existing scholarship in the field, and its central thesis, that a precise global balance of savoury, sour and piquant condiments is required to prevent the moon from fragmenting, is one that has received a commensurate degree of serious attention in the intervening years.>Furthermore, as the subject of the joke is ostensibly the correct attribution of sources, we were disappointed to see our work cited incompletely. For future reference the correct citation for the current edition is as follows:>Ketchup, J., Mustard, E. and Gravy. G. 2057. *Hollandaise, Salad Cream, Sriracha*. 3rd ed. Worcestershire: HP and Brown.>We do not ask that you remove or edit the reference, as we understand that a degree of creative license is sometimes required to make a joke function, however we do ask that you include this letter in full alongside the joke in accordance with our right to reply.>Warmest regards,>Dr. Johannes Ketchup, Technical University of Pretoria>Dr. Emery Mustard, United States Naval Academy at Annapolis>Dr. Geert Gravy, Université Flamande de Gand---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------After reviewing the letter three times and making several superficial changes to the wording, Dr. Johannes Ketchup added his own signature above those of his colleagues and pressed send on his futuristic electronic fax machine. The fax machine did not seem futuristic to Dr. Johannes Ketchup as he had purchased it five years previously, in the year 2056, but it is futuristic from the perspective of the time of writing.Sending the strongly worded letter of complaint made Dr. Ketchup feel briefly important and intelligent. But despite being an immensely important and intelligent man, Dr. Ketchup lacked the awareness to realise that his letter was not an addendum to a joke, but rather an integral part of it. Nor that his entire life was delimited by the boundaries of that same ongoing joke.Instead, the suspicion that his life was a joke haunted the peripheries of his consciousness, only coming to the surface in the form of a transient irritability which he took out indirectly on his wife and young son.Feeling his mood darken again, he began to run himself a warm bath in his ornate Greco-Roman bathtub, but the converging gravitational forces from the eight fragments of the moon caused the water to rise in an eerie pillar in the centre of the room.Still more distracted, he stormed into the nursery where, without understanding why, he struck his sleeping son violently on the head with his cane.The boy, in turn, sat bolt upright in bed and said, "*Orange* you glad I didn't say *Mayonnaise*?" as the blow had damaged the Wernicke's area of his brain. <|endoftext|>

First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving, which is unlikely. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added. This gives two possibilities:1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over. So which is it? If we accept the postulate given to me by Anabella during my Freshman year that, 'It will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you,' and take into account the fact that I slept with her last night, then number two must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over. The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it isnot accepting any more souls and is therefore, extinct..... ....leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a Divine Being which explains why, last night, Anabella kept shouting 'Oh my God.' <|endoftext|>

A masculine authoritative voice bellows. "Nobody move!"Suddenly, 7 Federal agents burst into the lobby where Mr Brent is waiting to enter the press conference."Clarke Brent?" A 6 foot 6 well-built black Federal agent narrows his eyes at him, whilst quickly flashing his badge. "FBI. You need to come with us - now!"Mr Brent's eyes widen."God! I've done nothing wrong. What's going on?"At that moment, the woman from the Ohio Lottery wanders into the lobby, pale-faced and terrified.Mr Brent stares at her and doesn't know what to think.At that moment, there is more commotion and screaming in the press conference room and someone bellows "Cleveland PD!"Confusion descends as 13 Cleveland PD officers burst into the lobby, hands on holsters, stern looks on their faces, powerful torsos sucking in air."What's going on here?!" A squat, barrel-bodied officer bellows at the FBI agents.The 6 foot 6 black agent snaps back at him. "Federal jurisdiction. This doesn't concern you. This is FBI business and this man here is coming with us."Another Cleveland PD officer steps forward, weapon unholstered, fingers near his firearm. "Now hold on just a sec-"Another loud commotion is heard in the press conference room and everybody in the lobby turns around in shock.11 well-built men in smart black suits march in, earpieces in ears."Secret Service. Clarke Brent? We're gonna need you to come with us."At tha moment, the raised voices of the FBI agents, the Cleveland cops and the Secret Service agents clamour over each other and a loud argument is breaking out.At that exact point, a small bomb explodes inside the Ohio Lottery Commission building and gunfire erupts, as women in bulletproof vests and long black overcoats start shooting at the cops and Federal agents and the Secret Service personnel. Screams, blood, terror and bullets flying.Clarke Brent is absolutely terrified. Amidst the gunfire, bodies flying and bullets, he quickly pulls out his blue Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra smartphone and pulls up his "Rewind app". He clicks "Rewind" and presses "Play" at the "1995" slot.Immediately the Cleveland Cops disappear, the FBI agents disappear, the woman from the Ohio Lottery disappears, the Secret Service agents disappear, the female militants disappear, the Ohio Lottery Commission building disappears and Clarke Brent is left standing in an endless white room with no ceiling, no walls and no end in sight.Suddenly, a small thin African man walks in, white-suited and wearing sunglasses, skin as black as night. He begins speaking in perfect English, a posh polished New Yorker drawl."Clarke - Are you sure you want to go back to 1995, back to the day you were born?"Mr Brent stares back at him, bewildered. He shakes his sadly. "No, Nero Godman. Take me back to before I was born. Take me back to the beginning of he universe."Nero Godman, the small African man, frowns back at him."Are you sure, Clarke? You do realize that you will not exist? This will be the end for you, for your corporeal form. Clarke Brent, as you are now, will cease to exist."Mr Brent blinks. "Do it. I'm done."Clarke Brent, the UCLA undergrad who won the $611m Powerball in Ohio in 2022, blinks out of existence. <|endoftext|>

The Soviet government has been putting more and more pressure on him and LermoCorp to increase the firepower of Superman.Lermontov Jr had been working feverishly day and night to fully harness the power of *Purple Kryptonite* and *Serbian Kryptonite* (a particularly special element which had been discovered in Serbia in the aftermath of a meteor strike in 2033).Serbian Kryptonite enabled Superman to take over the minds of any human within 400 miles of him. However, Lermontov Jr had found during experiments that there was a major problem: if an individual was sufficiently mentally strong or had hidden mental superpowers, they could resist and actually end up taking over Superman's own mind. Lermontov Jr was especially worried that the Americans were aware of this and that they were recruiting a team of super-powered "C-Men", psychic-powered superbeings who could, collectively as a whole, take over Superman's mind and make him work for US interests - especially horrible given that Superman was raised in Vladivostok since he was a baby ever since his spaceship landed there.Lermontov Jr was particularly stressed because he had so far omitted to inform the Soviet government of this major problem which, if it came to pass, could lead to the destruction of the Soviet Union as we know it.Just another day on Earth in the 2040s. <|endoftext|>

She stands up, coughing, and scans the room nervously. Numerous large monitors decorate the dark walls of the hall, and at the other end is a massive window, offering a fantastic view of the Shadow Realm and all of its floating islands and skies. Before the window stands a figure, draped with a long, ornate velvet robe, gazing at the view silently and without motion.The convict, who I should probably mention is Clie Nt, approaches the figure apprehensively. Though her footsteps clearly echo around the penthouse, the figure seems to be deliberately ignoring them. *Is this Him?* Clie wonders."Evening." His soft voice reverberates in the hall. What terrible acoustics.Clie freezes in place. "Uh… evening?"He draws a deep breath, but still keeps his gaze fixed on the window. "I trust that you've something to discuss.""Well, yes. Kind of. I've been asked to deliver a warning."The figure turns around. Clie isn't sure what face she expected him to have, but she is nonetheless baffled. His face is human. Beautifully human and innocent. The most distinct feature about it, doubtless, is his eyes, which boast a lovely golden color, an immaculate shade reminiscent of a whispering field of wheat bathed in the beams of a winter sunset. How droll.His eyes vaguely widen at the sight of her. "Clie Nt. Curious. You, of all people, I did not expect to find here.""Er… Do I know you?""I presume not. But I have heard much about you." He steps across the penthouse towards one of the monitors, beneath which a keyboard appears. He types something on it, and the screen fills with small text, scrolling up and down and shifting about. "These are your tales. And I think we are in yet another one.""Well… who are you, then?"He directs his yellow gaze to her. "I am the one known as the Shadow Master. I am the ruler of this world. But that is less important—tell me, Clie, what warning have you come to deliver?""It's about… the Ordinaryman. And how you have to destroy him.""The Ordinaryman? Hmm." He walks over to another monitor and types something else into it. Some more text appears on the screen, which he takes a moment to read. "I see. A rogue character, convinced that he is real. How bemusing." He leaves the monitor and ambles back to the center of the room, to submerge himself in the view of his kingdom.Clie raises an eyebrow. "Well? Are you going to destroy him?"The Shadow Master sighs. "Clie, I get requests all the time, about all kinds of things. When people are desperate, they come to me. Perhaps they see in me a mere last resort."He gestures at a large drawer in the wall. Clie approaches it warily and pulls it open, revealing the corpse of a beautiful woman upon whose chest a bloody pentagram has been carved. Clie recoils in horror. "What the hell?!""Indeed. This is just one of many 'sacrifices' I have been offered by some overworld organization. Their request is always the same: 'Contumeliis afficiunt Xakh'ath'akh'arus.'""Xakh'ath'akh'arus… I know that name.""Yes, it should be familiar. But these requests are not from your time—they date back to far earlier than when Xakh'ath'akh'arus first appears. Somehow, they had predicted what was to come, and asked me to destroy it.""But you didn't."He says nothing."Why?""Because I am not God. I am not the Author. I do not dictate what happens beyond my domain. The Shadow Realm is mine, and nothing else is.""But… the fate of the world relies on it! You *have* to destroy the Ordinaryman, or all is doomed! Isn't it?"He chuckles half-heartedly. "No. It isn't. That would be exciting, though, would it not? Defectus likes to pretend that his world lives on its own. That he can surrender control and watch its timeline go on without him. He created this dimension, too, and gave its command to me—as if it made any difference. He says he has no control over this realm, but that is not true; even these words that I speak, and the words that you speak, and everything that surrounds us—it's all his.""So why does he do it? Why does he pretend that his work is alive if it so clearly isn't? And if he truly makes everything, as well as the words you just said, why does it seem as if he's now admitting that it's all fake?""I fear I know not the answer. Perhaps it is for his own amusement. Perhaps for the amusement of others. Perhaps this is just something to distract him from his otherwise uneventful and dull life. Perhaps he wants people to like him. Perhaps this is the only medium of storytelling he feels comfortable with. Perhaps he's not competent at anything, and this is the only way he can both admit it and continue talking. I don't know. It's all open to interpretation." He sighs deeply. "That being said, I've made a promise. If I do find the Ordinaryman lurking around the Shadow Realm, I shall surely send him to ​.""To… to what?""​.""Are you saying something? I can't tell.""Indeed. ​ is a rather peculiar place; it is, in fact, nothingness. The nature of its nothingness, however, is remarkable—​ spreads at a very slow rate, and yet anything and everything it touches becomes part of it. There is no escape from ​; once you go in, you're not coming out. Simple as that. Allow me to demonstrate."He walks over to yet another monitor, where instead of black text on a white background, live footage of a large dinosaur asleep on a hillside is displayed on the screen. "This is Rex the Tyrannosaurus. Earlier today, he slaughtered an innocent herbivore and devoured its carcass. As retribution, I shall send him to ​. Observe."The Shadow Master performs an odd gesture with his hands, and a brief snapping sound is heard. When Clie returns her gaze to the monitor, the dinosaur has vanished from the hillside."Now, here is ​," he says, pressing a button on the keyboard. The view of the hillside is replaced by a transparent background, through which the back of the monitor can be seen. The figure of the same sleeping dinosaur appears in the center, but it soon begins evaporating at an accelerating rate, its body breaking apart faster and faster into nothingness, until, mere seconds later, it is completely gone, and all that remains is a blank screen."Rex is no more." He presses a button on the keyboard and the screen turns black. "That shall be the fate of the Ordinaryman, as well, if he is to set foot in my kingdom.""Hmm. Isn't that cruel?""That is up to Defectus to decide. He is the one making these decisions.""Does that truly exempt you from your moral obligations, though?""Perhaps. I am not one to judge." The Shadow Master returns to his view. "Now that you have delivered your warning, it is time to close the loop. I shall send you back to your time, and to your friend. You will surely see me again in your future, but as for me, this is farewell. Best of luck on your journey, Clie. You will not need it." He does another odd gesture, and Clie disappears.[How droll.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiAntiJokes/comments/cx2da1/i_like_my_coffee_like_i_like_my_women/f59fwb5) <|endoftext|>

Mr. Clinton's mansion, he zoomed through the dull pleasantries and immediately said he wanted to show me something. Something of the utmost importance. “I’m just here for our interview Mr.- “ “Listen, Ike”, Bill interrupted, assigning me a nickname I would continue to bear throughout the day, “I’m kind of a big fuckin’ deal, so you’re just gonna have to cool your god damn jets”. I couldn’t argue. This was perhaps the biggest interview of my career, so I followed without protest. The floors we were walking on were as ornate as the decor of the building. The black and white checkered marble tiling gave way to a gorgeous stucco wall covered in fine paintings and tapestries. The hallway alone looked like something out of Caligula's palace. To be fair, the scores of nude women who reclined on the expensive-looking furniture may have skewed my perception. Adorned upon the walls—which were already dripping with ivy wreaths and Ionian columns chiseled from the finest, whitest marble—was painting after painting. “This one’s a Rothko,” he said, noticing my preoccupation. He chuckled to himself as if he had just told me an extremely clever joke. “I’ve got a few more in my closet upstairs. C’mon, Hoss. We’re going that way anyhow.” We made our way to his room, and he kept pointing out vases and paintings. Saying they were from “the golden age of vasedom”, and “the neo-post-classical era of pastel”. I think he just made up terms to impress me. After what seemed like a two-hour tour of the portrait gallery led by someone who just started their art history elective, we finally arrived at a set of doors. I’m not sure why it struck me the way it did that the doors were so tall, but nevertheless I found myself almost impressed for the first time. Bill must have seen this in my face because he began prattling on about how they were aged oak doors. “The same kind they use for wine barrels.”He neglected to mention the “KEEP OUT” and “NO GIRLS ALLOWED” signs, hand-drawn on pieces of notebook paper. But they were taped on all the same. With great showmanship, he kicked the doors open like a cowboy bursting into a saloon. His room looked like it hadn’t changed since he was 17. There were posters on nearly every square inch of the walls and Cape Cod-style slanted ceiling, mostly for 80s rock bands. There was a large poster of Slash on the back of one of his doors, and above his racecar bed there was a huge Grateful Dead tapestry. “Welcome to the Pleasure Dome,” he said. Bill made his way to his closet, and I quickly said, “Oh, Mr. Clinton, I really don’t need to see your other Rothkoes, we should just get to the interview.”“Oh, yeah, the Rothkoes. That’s okay. We’ll get to those another day then. That’s not what I’m getting”. He rummaged around his closet, and in the bottom of a cardboard box, labeled “homework”, he pulled out a can of soda. He brought it back to the center of the room and took a seat in his beanbag chair. “Pop a squat!” he said, motioning to the egg-chair opposite his bean bag throne. I took a seat on the oval chair next to one of his train sets. As I was taking my seat, I noticed Bill unscrewing the top of his ersatz soda can and extracting a glass pipe and a grinder. “If my mom ever finds my weed, she’d totally freak,” he said. He began to pack the bowl, so I took out my recorder and set it down. At long last the interview could begin. “So, mister Clinton,” I said. “Your foundation is-”“C’mon man, hit this,” he said, trying to keep the smoke in as interrupted. I tried to tell him no, but he kept pushing. “This is really good weed, man. If you don’t hit this, you’re basically wasting it.” I told him I really didn’t want to get high right now but looked at me with a twinkle in his eye and said, “that’s okay, man, we’ll just get a little high.” He shot me a wink. We did not get just a little high. Every time the bowl emptied, I watched Bill produce more flower to pack it full again. Bowl after bowl was smoked, and somewhere around bowl number fourteen I begged him to stop. I could barely think straight, and it felt like my heart was going to beat out of my chest. “I didn’t know you were gonna be such a gay little pussy,” Bill Clinton said, ignoring my pleas and handing me the pipe for one more rip. I took a little puff, and Bill said, “you didn’t even inhale! What are you running for congress?” I sighed and allowed myself to enter Bill’s headspace. I laid back on his racecar bed as at long last he put away his herb and paraphernalia. “You wanna hear me play the saxophone?” Bill asked as he emerged from the closet empty-handed. I couldn’t remember how to talk, but he took my silence in the affirmative. He began rummaging through the trunk of his bed, and finally produced a set of VHS tapes. He put one in the TV across the room and turned the dial to channel 4. The tape was a recording of him on some late-night talk show campaigning for something. He was playing careless whisper. “Pretty sweet, huh”, he asked rhetorically. “Alright, I guess I’m ready to do your little interview or whatever.” Finally. I pulled out my recorder and found myself at a loss for words. My head was too clouded from Bill Clinton’s dank. “What, uh... So, do you think that… did the moon landing happen?” I heard myself ask. Bill chuckled to himself. “You know, Ike, the moon landing was just one of those things, you know? When they first let me into the White House, I asked the same thing, and do you know what they told me?” He looked at me for affirmation. I shrugged. He didn’t say anything, he just winked at me. I’m not sure I’ve seen anyone wink as much as Bill did. The talk show host was asking questions now, as Bill had finished playing for the crowd, so he stood up and turned off the TV. He sauntered over to a box and pulled out the Dark Side of the Moon album. He put it on his player. “Hey,” he said, barely holding in a chuckle. “Do you wanna hear about my newest art project?”With great effort, I managed a nod.“So, like, I’m gonna just shit. Shit all over a canvas, right? And then I’m gonna like, scrape it all around with a palette knife, and then,” he wheezed a laugh. “Then I’m gonna sell it at an auction, and the money is gonna go to the Clinton foundation!” He fell to the ground and laughed hard and long at his own joke. He wiped tears from his eyes. “Aw man. Bill Clinton cracks himself up.'' He was doubled over, laughing those hard, breathy laughs that only a man with leather lungs could muster. “But seriously man, check this out.” Bill began spinning the record backwards with his bare fingers. Pink Floyd blared through the speakers, backward and distorted. The haunting anti-melodies intruded my already clouded mind, and I saw great visions of vast deserts. At that very moment, Bill Clinton came to me in a vision. He towered over me, roaring saxophone notes into the dry, Coptic air. My body emerged from a great woven basket in the form of a snake as his hard-bop post-jazz aroused me from my slumber. I rose and rose, and Bill played louder and louder, and the notes turned into a message that I strained to hear. I yearned to understand what Bill was trying to tell me. I leaned my snake-body forward, craning my long back, aching to know Bill’s secret knowledge-“THERE IT IS!” he yelled. The music halted and I was lucid again. “Listen,” he said with the crazed intensity of a lunatic. Every word that came out of his mouth had the grave seriousness of a schizophrenic man telling you exactly how the world will end. “Listen really closely, Ike. This is where Roger Waters told me I was the Messiah. He told me that I will be a great ruler and bring peace to the kingdom of Israel in the great and terrifying end times. Do you hear it, man? Can you hear Roger’s guitar talking to me? He’s telling me, man. He’s telling me.”Bill had worked up quite a sweat. With every word he said his neck strained tighter. Every muscle in his face ached in a competition to see which one could contort hardest. The tendons in his neck strained hard enough that I thought they would burst from under his skin. “Man, it’s a good thing I didn’t listen when I was in the Oval Office… There wouldn’t be a fuckin’ Iran anymore, I can tell you that much. Shit, man. There wouldn’t be an England either. Her majesty Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of her other realms and- man FUCK you!” As he said this last part, he slammed his fist on the turntable, hard enough to split the record.“Aw, I’m sorry, man. No more Waters. I guess I turned Waters into whine, huh?” Again, Bill howled at his own joke. “C’mon, man. I’ve got one last thing I want you to see.”We left his room and went back down the grand, Corinthian staircase. As we walked, Bill produced a joint from behind his ear and lit it up. In two great sucks, it vanished to nothing but a filter. He flicked it haphazardly aside, and I noted the circular charcoal stain it left on the head of the priceless marble statue. It bounced off and rolled back down the hall before it finally stopped at Bill’s feet. One of his many women appeared to pick up the roach. Her bare feet pattered against the tile and she scurried directly in front of Mr. Clinton, cutting him off. “You bitch!” He roared. “Do you think Bill Clinton is paying you to get in his goddamn way?” The small, dark woman shrank into herself as Bill towered over her. Her naked body pushed further into the cold, hard floor, as she held her hands in front of her face. Mr. Clinton rose his great pale hand into the air.“What the hell is your name?'' he said, hand still poised for attack. “Juanita,” she said. “No, it isn’t! In Bill Clinton’s house, only Bill has a name! Do you understand?”Her voice was small and squeaky. “I’m so sorry Mr. Clinton, sir. It will not happen again. Please, Mr. Clinton sir, please don’t hurt me”. “Aww hell,'' he finally said. “Make yourself useful and pick up the roach. It won’t be the only butt you get to pinch today.” He prodded me with his elbow and winked for the umpteenth time. “We like to have fun around here,'' he said. “Don’t put this in your story.”As we rounded the final corner, a flock of maids skittered away like roaches. Behind them, the entrance to a great open room. Inside, vines twisted over us like great verdant rafters, rocked by zephyrs that curled between looming Grecian columns. “I like to come here when I want to have a big ole think,” said Bill. He rubbed his chin, and stood for a while in pensive silence. We watched the wind sway the vines, and the birds in the trees. Finally, Bill broke the silence.“I keep having this dream, man. I’m in a forest, and I’m surrounded by tribesman—you know the type. Big boys with some meat on ‘em. The kinda fellas who you just know are looking to eat either you or your horse, depending on what kinda day they’ve had? Hell, that’s the only reason I gave those Chayannese boys their eagle feathers, who knows who they would’ve eaten?” He sparked another joint and took a long drag.“But I’m in these woods, surrounded by these fellas, and Ike, believe me when I tell you they are mean. They look at me like I am just the worst president in the whole wide world, and suddenly their head honcho, or chief, or morubixaba—I think they’re Tupi—comes over and says something like ‘ongo bongo welcome to our jongle,’ and I’m not gonna look a warrior like that in the eye and say no! But I guess he doesn’t know that, or he sees that I’m not really into it, so he gives his men some sort of look and they tie me up and drag me off and we go down this long and winding path.“For hours, man, we’re just trudging deeper and deeper into the humid darkness, and off deep in the trees along the path, I swear I see something. But the longer I look out into the darkness of the canopy or whatever they call it, the more I think there’s nothing there at all and all the while, these boys keep dragging me into the thick of it. And the sounds, Ike, they’re like nothing you could believe. I’ve only heard the birds here in the U. S. of A. and maybe a few of the socialist ones, and maybe some monarchical ones in the sandier regions back during my reign, but man, these birds! They make the strangest sounds. It’s like a buzz and a whine, and a few pops—I can’t describe it right, but you’ve just gotta believe me on this, no one has ever heard these sounds outside of the furthest depths of the Amazonian jungle. “So, these bird sounds keep getting stranger and stranger, and the path gets more clear, and suddenly, we’re back in a village full of tribal women and children. All around me I hear people and birds chittering, and the tribesmen keep pulling me and take me to this massive, Texas-sized wigwam, and inside is the oldest man I’ve ever seen. This wrinkled old glove-face Indian is just sitting there, lit up by the fire he’s stirring, and without looking up he motions for me to come in.“‘Welcome back,’ he says, and man, I wish I could remember if he said that the first dream. But before I can get to thinking too long about what he means, he says ‘Ole Bill, now I’m gonna tell you something important, so listen up.’ He says, ‘you’ve been chosen, and I don’t just mean to save America. You’ve been chosen to save the whole world.’ Now of course, I’m a little taken aback by this. I mean, you know me, I already know I’m the Messiah and all, but this Indian seems to think I’ve been chosen for something even more important. Now, the Indian starts loading up a long pipe with some pretty stank-ass vegetable matter, if you catch my drift, Ike. Then he tells me, ‘try not to forget what I’m about to tell you.’ He takes a long drag of his long pipe, he holds it in, then he blows it out into my face. Now, I don’t know Indian culture and etiquette, but I do know normal etiquette, and that’s just not a very kind thing to do in Arkansas, so I start to yell at him. Well, I try, but as soon as I open my mouth, I find I can’t.“Suddenly, my whole body is made of wood and I’m like this giant ungahari tree. For some reason, I know I’ve been watching over these people for eons. My mind is flooded with the secrets of the galaxy, and the universe and stuff. And it’s all flowing in from the earth mother down below, up through my roots, like I’m the universe’s knowledge antenna. And I’m so totally discombobulated that I just have to wake up and recombobulate myself, or the whole universe will disappear! At which point, I of course find I cannot. It’s not until I give in and allow myself to live the life of every human being who has ever lived that I can finally rest. I just have to sit there and endure every act of evil and kindness that ever has and ever will occur, all while these Indians strip away my bark to roll fat-ass blunts with. Are you still following, Ike? Because this is when it starts getting really good.“So once I finish living every life, and having every single human emotion—and by the way, did you know that happiness in the ‘30s feels different than it does now? And that sadness in the Roman Empire was a vastly different sensation than it is right now, but in the future, it becomes the same again? Never mind, it doesn’t matter. So, the earth mother comes to me in the form of a leopard. Like, the spirit of the earth itself, just sitting there in a leopard body. I know she’s the earth mother, and she knows I’m Bill Clinton. But at this point, I’ve entirely forgotten the concept of self, because of the whole living everyone’s life bit. But she says to me, ‘now do you understand?’ Ike, she’s so kind about it too. She gently paws a little bug off of my root that was squirming around and tickling me, and I tell her, ‘I don’t know,’ because I don’t know. Now, I don’t think leopards can smile, but Gia does, and she says, ‘that’s okay little one, you don’t need to. Just don’t forget what we’ve shown you.’ and then, finally, I wake up.”Bill stared at me for a long time. He was out of breath. I was still pretty high, so I was having some trouble remembering all of the details of his story, but my tape recorder got it. “Sounds like a crazy dream, man,” I said. I wished he would stop looking at me with his crazed, red eyes. “No, man. That was no dream,” he said. “That was the real world. What were in right now, that’s the dream,” he said. “Weren’t you listening to anything I said, man? That’s the real world! I’ve lived your life a thousand times, and I’ve lived mine a thousand. We’ve had this entire conversation a thousand times! I know you better than you know yourself, and I know with certainty what’s going to happen in the world we’ll leave behind.” He threw a piece of gravel through one of the windows in the ceiling of his arboretum and screamed. “I am everyone, everyone is me! Don’t you get it? Don’t you understand anything? Why are you asking me questions about the damn Clinton Foundation? You should be asking me about why I, the god that created this very universe, picked Pi exactly the way I did! Why did I, your creator, make Hydrogen the way I made it! Why did I pick the gravitational constant in such a way that you could exist? Aren’t you even a little curious?” Bill was beginning to worry me, so I started backing away. “Aww heck,” he said. “I’m just teasin’, Ike.” He clapped me on the back. “But don’t forget, I’ve already lived your life a thousand times, so I know what you’re going to say about me. I don’t mind. Don’t bother sending me a review copy, just publish what you’re going to publish.” I all but ran out of the room, past his harem, to the front door. Before I could get it open, Bill put his hand on it, holding it closed. “Ike,” he said. "Just one thing I don't want you to mention in your story." He glared at me, returning to his snake form, filling the room with his serpentine presence and the foul, olfactory symphony of death. I was but a cockroach standing before the god that was Bill Clinton as he hissed and swung his enormous body up through the glass ceiling, shattering it, just like Hillary. He swooped back down, inches from me and spoke in a slow, melodic voice. "When you mention my bed", he hissed, eyes beginning to glow red. "Lie about the wheels." <|endoftext|>

Most unseemly was the edifice that resulted, for it is the prerogative of God, not man, to strike confusion and inspire wonder. In time there came to the bar a king of Arabs, and the bartender (to muck the simplicity of his guest) bade him enter the labyrinth, where the king of Arabs wandered, humiliated and confused, until the coming of the evening, when he implored God’s aid and found the door. His lips offered no complaint, though he said to the bartender that in his land he had another labyrinth, and Allah willing, he would see that someday the bartender made its acquaintance. Then he returned to Arabia with his captains and his wardens and he wreaked such havoc upon the sports bar, and with such great blessing by fortune, that he brought low his stools, crushed his pool table, and took the bartender himself captive. He tied him atop a swift-footed camel and led him into the desert. Three days they rode, and then he said to him, “O king of time and substance and cipher of the century! In your sports bar didst thou attempt to make me lose my way in a labyrinth of brass with many stairways, doors, and walls; now the Powerful One has seen fit to allow me to show thee mine, which has no stairways to climb, nor walls to impede thy passage.”Then he untied the bonds of the bartender and abandoned him in the middle of the desert, where he died of hunger and thirst. This was mostly a short story by Jorge Luis Borges. I changed all mentions of the King of Babylonia to a bartender and of Babylonia to a sports bar to justify a title that would sound like a joke. The rest up until this paragraph is the short story verbatim. Some would even say this isn't an anti-anti-joke (though Allah’s knowledge is greater). Glory to him who does not die. <|endoftext|>

The square cup says to the bartender, "Man, life's been rough lately. Even though I earned my economics degree at the top of my class nearly six months ago, I'm still unable to find a job! I beg you, pour me a pint of your special ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄ to help me forget for a little while."The bartender, not wishing to further pry into the cup's personal life, quietly obliges, pouring a pint of ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄ into the talking cup's head. Immediately, the glass of ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄ suspiciously transforms into a glass of root beer with equal mass and volume. Although one would assume a square cup would have experience with such a phenomenon, the square cup is taken aback. Not wanting to raise any suspicion about his surprise, he pays for the drink, thanks the bartender, and leaves the bar with his heart pounding.As the square cup gets his wits about him, he immediately contacts a porcelain manufacturer based in China. He arranges for a shipment of 500 porcelain square cups to be sailed to the United States every other Tuesday for 20,000 Chinese Yuan, having paid for the first shipment through a large loan. Once the first shipment arrives, the cup takes the public transport to the very same bar, a luxury which he can seldom afford. He walks into the bar armed with ten identical square cups. "Pour me ten pints of your finest ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄," the cup demands of the bartender.Not wanting to miss out on the profits that could be made by selling ten pints of the notoriously expensive ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄, the bartender silently obliges, pouring the square cup ten shimmering pints of ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄ into each of the square cups. The ten pints of ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄ begin to change composition once more into root beer, as the original square cup predicted. He rushes out of the bar and to the local market to sell some of this substance. Those who purchase it regard it as "the purest and most delicious root beer the world has ever seen," and its market value skyrockets.As the Chinese workers labor, producing more and more square porcelain cups, the original square cup begins to increase his scale of production more and more, hiring more and more employees to demand more and more ㌤セ〢㕫Й☌⠑⡥㍄ from the original bartender. As the square cup's pile of money exponentially increases in size, the entire world develops an inexplicable addiction to the new, purest form of root beer. The formula is kept secret from the public, ensuring a perpetual monopoly on the production of pure, addictive root beer. Indeed, the entirety of humanity becomes helplessly enslaved by the iron grip of the Square Cup, as He is the only one who sells that which they must purchase. The men and women of America speak His name with a tone of mixed fear and admiration. All men and women love the Square Cup. All hail the Square Cup. All hail. <|endoftext|>

"Here's the deal," he tells him, "if you teach me how to be happy, I will give you all you could possibly desire.""Happiness is a choice, therefore it does not exist," the wise man says. "I can teach you to be content, however.""I will not stop hunting until I am happy," the tycoon replies, ready to leave the man in search of another way."That's the problem, you see! You will never be happy if you are not content.""You're out of your depth, grandpa. Content is the remedy of the past. Happiness is the future.""Perhaps. But who's to say happiness won't suffer the same fate as content, only to be replaced by something else?""I will not be around when that happens. I wish to indulge in the joys of life as much as I can while I'm still here.""Then why are you unhappy?""Happiness presupposes reasons. I have no reason to be happy. Being happy without a reason is a sign of dementia.""Is wanting to be happy not a wonderful reason to be happy?""Huh. I guess it is." The tycoon smiles. "Thank you, good sir. How might I repay you?""I want to know how to be happy.""Happiness is a choice. You can only be happy if you wish to be happy. Wanting to be happy is the first step towards happiness.""That's balderdash—seeking happiness will only make you more miserable. Happiness must come to you naturally.""You're right. Wanting to be happy is the first step towards happiness, but it is only that—the first step. The second step is to allow happiness to flow into your mind. It's like establishing a socket—you can't expect to receive data before you open a port.""Wanna have sex?""Sure."The tycoon and the old man copulate for the next hour, then they kiss each other goodbye and go back to their boring, unfulfilling lives. I guess happiness really is fleeting. <|endoftext|>

After weeks of heavy shootings and minor progressions the Belgian colonel comes up with an idea. He says: "Guys, I've got a plan. Watch me!" and he takes position. He raises his voice towards the Germans and calls: "Friedrich?" and 50m away a German raises his head and replies "Jawohl!" and gets shot. The colonel explains to his troups that almost every man in Germany is named "Franz, Heinrich, Andreas or Friedrich" so those are the best names. The next week Germans suffer huge losses due to this tactic and the German colonel says to his unit: "Okay, Belgians are all called Jan, Pieter or Jonas! I'll show you!" The Belgian colonel is not stupid of course, so when he hears "Jan, you there?" he screams to his troups to get the fuck down and NOT react. When the German calls again he replies "Is it you, Franz?" Jawohl! <|endoftext|>

Splashes invariably occur from collisions between water and the people using the appliances, say my family or me, more often than not.Now, I know what you're thinking, what about when me or my family get out of the bath and water drops from our bodies on to the floor, do those splashes count? Do I count large pools of water? If two drops join, do I count them as one drop or two? Well, yes, the answers you suspect for those questions are indeed correct. I make a reasonable living doing what I do and I enjoy the challenges, plus I of course get to work from home.Today, after my wife had gone to work and taken the kids to school, there were about 37 individual splashes of water on the floor of my downstairs bathroom. They weren't large. Don't worry, me and my family are not slobs. The splashes were of a size that it was reasonable to have left them on the floor if you had something else to do that day. I had marked their positions and taken photographic evidence. Stopwatches for each had been started and I then had to keep on top of any of them evaporating into nothingness. You probably thought this line of work was pretty easy, but imagine keeping an eye on 37 stopwatches and getting all the time details accurate.At about 13:45 the goat came in. I don't know if you've ever looked a goat in the eye, but there's a certain kind of angry intelligence that you can sense in there, that's despite their lack of ability to verbally communicate. You look a goat in the eye and you can tell there is a lot going on, and there's not a lot of what is going on that that goat is happy about.The goat left, maybe 14:15 at a rough estimate, and I carried on watching the drops and accounting for any new splashes I might happen to make during my toilet breaks. <|endoftext|>

Each group was asked to give three reasons for its recommendation.The men's group decided that "computer" should definitely be of thefeminine gender ("la computer"), because:1.

[OC] Meaning that it involved the mass mobilization of a country's resources. Britain was one of the nations that really felt the effects of the so called "total war", as civilians played a greater role in the military than ever before. Even though they were geographically separated from the rest of Europe, they were hit hard by the war. German shipping blockades cut off foreign supply, which meant that supplies had to be rationed, and many raw materials went towards the war effort, used in industrial production. This led to a shortage of some fabrics such as silk and cotton.Additionally, the British government demanded food rations be given to its people. As a result, many nutritional foods were scarce.In response to the scarcity of fabric for clothing production, a British sheep farmer named Calvin Broadus invented a new type of fabric, which he called "tweed". This fabric was made of wool, but the British military found no practical use for it in the war effort. Due to the abundance of sheep in the United Kingdom, farmers everywhere started producing tweed, as Broadus' method was circulated rapidly by the British government.As with the military, British civilians found few practical uses of the new "wonder material". It had poor insulation, was rough to wear, and it shrunk easily when washed, and most importantly didn't look fashionable. It seemed as though the war drained British creativity too, as fashion designers could find no suitable design with tweed. They settled with creating plaid designs with a few dull colors, since these could be produced more efficiently.As the war moved on, Germany's control of mainland Europe and the water around Britain decreased. With the Americans now in the war, Britain's military centered industry (some would say a precursor the military industrial complex) had a break. The United States, with its large amount of resources, picked up some of the slack, reducing Britain's quota of war production. This meant good news for the British textile industry, which was reduced to producing for the war. Upper class British people could afford to buy expensive fabrics that were not available to them, such as the cotton and silk mentioned above. However, since the war was still going on, these materials were extremely expensive, so only British aristocrats could buy them.In addition, excess tweed manufacturing gave Britain a surplus- they were left with more of this useless fabric than ever. British families were given large amounts of tweed. Some people tried making the tweed into useful items, like blankets, but due to its poor ductility, it took a long time to manufacture them. With British men in the military, women took up manufacturing jobs, in addition to their duties at home, which meant they were left with little time to deal with their surplus of tweed at home.Women in London first discovered a useful application of tweed. By sheer luck, historians claim, these women discovered that burning a strand of tweed for a long time over a fire would produce a fibrous strand that was edible and nutritious. Scientists today found out that this product was nutritious due to ammonium nitrate in the sheeps' grazing land. The process of creating this fibrous food was still long, and it took about 12 hours. In order to increase efficiency (we see a pattern here), various women would prepare this in bulk amounts in city parks. During this time period, you would see bonfires throughout open spaces in the city, since British women were burning fabric. However, historians have discovered no pictures of these events, since the British government forbade photography (or destroyed photos) of this process as not to reveal secrets to the enemy.The British military saw a problem in the post-tweed manufacturing process. German planes would be able to spot cities since there were large "tweed bonfires" as the process of making the fibrous food extended past daytime. So, the British government mandated that tweed production into food would only occur during the day, as not to assist the nighttime German blitzkriegs. This was seen as only a mild inconvenience to city-dwelling British people, but it still took all day, from sunrise to sunset, to produce this food.In 1945, this process died out, since the war ended. This is why you do not see people doing this today. Due to the effectiveness of British intelligence, this process had been relatively unknown to foreigners. This changed, when in 1996 a man named Cordozar Broadus was walking his dog in a park in Manchester. They reached a heavily wooded section of the park, and his curious, but nosy dog unearthed a series of tools that were used in the tweed refining process. Broadus remembered seeing his father's war notes after snooping around in the attic. His father's extremely detailed notes described the procedure of tweed production. The inspired Broadus decided to do more research into the subject, but he was shut down by the British government. In 1998, Broadus, now a musical artist, decided to slowly reveal this secret, in an album, but under an alias (so the government wouldn't suspect him).To credit his mischievous mutt, he used the pseudonym "Snoop Dogg", and released his single, "Smoke Tweed Everyday." <|endoftext|>

We're in an oven! How the hell did we get in here?"The chef hears their cries, pulls out a knife, starts chopping chives, and answers "You're in Hell's Kitchen now! That's how."Both atheists, equally shocked by the depth of their realization, reply in unison "You've got to be joking!"The chef smirks. His eyes shine wildly. He knows what he be feeding the homeless during the cold December months...Two renegade atheists who posed as christians so they could con my church into giving them Thanksgiving turkey for free. Not as long as my church still calls me Father Pete, the Turkey ManThe chef turns toward the oven, his priest collar pops out from under his apron. He says "My God you're right! I was joking." Father Pete motions toward his collar. "Now you may understand."The atheists, slowly baking, take a gander at the collar and become frantic. One atheist says "but isn't it against your religion to harm others? Commandment XI says "Thou shall not kill' You must let us out or you will commit a cardinal sin and be sent to Hell"The chef sneers at the atheist through the charcoal dusted oven window "THOU ART AN ATHEIST. THOU DOS AS THOU PLEASES WITH NO REGARD TO THE SHADOW OF GOD AND SATAN!WHAT KNOW YOU OF SIN!?"The other atheist, burning alive, chimes in "Uh pretty much only Commandment XI. Plus everybody knows atheists dont go well with chives. We are too jive for that turkey, man."Pastor Pete was taken aback by this statement. His ego swells with a sense of pride "You are aware of what they call me?"One atheist (it doesn't matter which one anymore) despite the heated convection currents bubbling his skin, says "Of course we knew of your title, you're Pastor Pete the Turkey Man! Curator of the best damn turkey this side of the Earth"Pastor Pete deepens his thought and his mood. He realizes that enjoying a simple Thanksgiving shouldn't be hindered by belief systems or backgrounds and that his turkey could bring people of any turkey ingesting belief together. He pondered for a moment, while the atheists screamed in agony, just how he should change his ways, maybe how he could be more "hip and in" with new cultures that differ from his. Pastor Pete opens the oven door only to realize that the atheist had cooked just past the point of living. Immediately he feels ashamed and is overcome by a need to repent.

He reached for and climbed the cross, only to lose his grip and fall again, breaking the bones in his left hand.20. "Peter," Jesus said one last time, and his voice was fraught with death."21. At this, Peter found himself imbued with the Holy Spirit, and thus did he climb. 22. Reaching the apex of the cross, he wrapped himself onto it and touched Jesus' face.23. "My Lord!
