It\'ll all start on that day.Back then, one would dub this day the twentieth of April, sixty-nine thousand and sixty-nine, or 4/20/6969. To some this date would\'ve seemed humorous, perhaps funny. And, well, it is a little. But it wasn\'t funny to one person in particular. That person was Adolf J. Hitler. 5000 years earlier, in his Führerbunker, he headed into his study with his wife at his side, his heart pounding restlessly. He knew it was the end. That\'s what he told everyone. Except… the end of what? He intentionally left that detail vague.The date was the 20th of April, 1969. That\'s the date when Hitler disappeared. Not one day earlier or later. I think.But of course, Hitler, as always, had one last Karte up his Ärmel, as they say. He had dabbled in the dark arts some time earlier in the year, and found a spell that he knew early on would come in handy, and this… this was the time to use it. 5000 years of slumber in the astral plane, before he will abruptly return to his old reality, reborn into a new state of existence. He would hold power greater than that any mortal being had ever witnessed before!The year will be AD 6969.AD, meaning "Anno Domini" (Latin for "in the year of the Lord"), is of course the opposite of BC, or "Before Christ." A common misconception is that, like BC, AD comes after the year number, but it should actually come *before* it. Just a bit of trivia.Anyway, the year\'ll be 6969 AD, 5000 years after Hitler\'s vanishing. It\'s hard to say precisely what state the Earth was in. It\'s all a blur to me. But not long after the spell had finally worked its way into Hitler\'s heart, we land in the beginning, and in the end. When all that will happen is happening, but all that happens comes later. It will be time itself.It was most unfortunate that Hitler did not manage to fall asleep in the astral plane. As the curse coursed through his veins, he coarsely cursed, yet he never dreamt. For 5000 years he had nought to do but wait for the time to come, and after a mere 200 years it was starting to piss him off.Figuring the only solution to this rage was to take revenge on time itself, the only barrier between his old life and his newer, he vowed to destroy time as soon as he\'d acquired the power to do so. And that\'s exactly what he\'ll do. The year\'ll be A 6969 D. The date will be 4/20 (fuckin americans). The time will be 13:37. This will all happen. It is the only thing that "will" ever happen, because it\'ll all happen once and once only. For one Planck time, everything was together, living in harmony, singing the last song of time, before it\'ll all break apart.And then it\'ll happen.The next Planck time, everything will freeze. A new face will emerge, and it\'ll stare at every thing that exists, ever existed, and ever will exist, right in the eyes. That\'ll include you, at this very moment, as you read through the lines of this anti-anti-joke.The next Planck time, the face becomes real. It is that of the darkmage Xakh\'ath\'akh\'arus, and as his mighty body rises from the mountain it once rested on, and his eyes blink open revealing two glowing white sockets, a shudder creeps through the core of the Earth itself. Without time to define velocity, and indeed velocity to define space, the universe is plunged into a state of nothingness, and for the first time in many millions of years, no one has the time to care. Literally. Xakh\'ath\'akh\'arus soon realizes this problem, and so he creates a new temporal system, one so vaguely defined as to be skippable at will. No longer will eternity be a block that you cannot pass through—for now, you can wait an eternity using a supertask!Consider this: Do you want to wait one eternity in 2 minutes? Simple! Wait 1 second in 1 minute, then wait another second in 30 seconds, then another second in 15 seconds, and another one in 7.5, and another one in 3.75, and so on, always waiting for half the time left. Although there is always another second left to wait in eternity, you can always cut the remaining wait time in half, and so, when 2 minutes have passed, you will indeed have waited infinitely many seconds—one eternity in just 2 minutes. How about that?And what about old time, you say? Old time can stay behind us. The past shall stay where it is; the future shall simply be the one Planck time in which Xakh\'ath\'akh\'arus was born; and the present shall be allocated for everything that exists after the future, in the new temporal system. Perfectly balanced, blah blah blah.It is now that our story begins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just kidding. Fast forward to###FIFTY-FOUR ETERNITIES LATERSociety is still trying, and failing, to cope with this newfound reality. Bars are a thing of the past—the only thing left are alcohol-free restaurants. You see, being intoxicated within this temporal system enables one to accidentally wait several eternities into the future, thereby missing out on an entire life without wanting to and thus possibly losing family and relatives. As such, it is agreed upon the remainder of surviving civilization to share one universal law: NO BARS. To avoid ambiguity, prison bars are also outlawed, as well as sick rap bars and chocolate bars. Prisons are to use bullet-proof glass instead, raps must not consist of more than one line, and chocolate is banned. This last decision was the most controversial of them all because it was put forward by a black guy.Suddenly, two people, a silver-haired man and a brunette-haired woman, materialize out of thin air on a roof in a graffiti-laden street, both leaning forward rather uncomfortably, their lips touching. Not long after, they both open their eyes, and quickly flinch away from each other."Who the hell are you?" asks the woman."W-what… who the hell are *you*?!" the man retaliates."I\'m… I… I don\'t know, actually.""Wait. Me neither. Sorry for shouting at you.""It\'s okay. Don\'t stress about it."The man inspects their surroundings. Dull, grey buildings cover the landscape as far as the eye can see. Not a single skyscraper impedes the view. "Where are we?" he asks.The woman looks down below the roof. A good five yards above ground level, for sure. She is not as athletic as she used to be. Wait— "Wait. I think I\'m remembering who I am," she says."You are?" asks the man."Yeah, yeah. It\'s coming back. But it\'s slow. I think I\'m a… a vegetarian?""Oh. Cool." The man, still not recalling his identity, envies her speedy recollection. "Do you hear that?""The voice that said that you envy my speedy recollection?" Whoops."What? No, those Latin shouts. At least I think it\'s Latin." He\'s right. Those are Latin shouts. And they\'re getting louder. Realizing what is to come, he grabs the woman\'s hand. "Come with me!""What? Where—"The roof hatch suddenly bursts open, and a short surly-looking nun emerges with a shotgun in her arms."Come on, come on!" the man yells, running across the roof tiles as gunshots boom behind them."SPERO HOC SONAT FORMIDULOSUS, TRUX N-WORDS!"The woman screeches as he jumps off the roof and onto another, bolting with her hand and ducking behind a solar water heater."NUNC EGO NON REPREHENDO, SI RECTE DE FIDELI TRANSLATIONE CONSTET NAM SI PATI LASSUS SUM!" the nun shouts in what definitely sounds like Latin."Jesus Christ," the man yell-whispers, breathing heavily. "Are you okay?"The woman\'s eyes are wide open with fear, and yet, thrill. "Wow. That was fun.""It… was?" he breathes. "Huh. Yeah. It *was* fun." A smile climbs onto his lips. "Wanna do it again?"The woman returns a hearty grin. "Hell yeah."They jump again onto an adjacent roof, and for the few moments her feet hover above the ground, the woman feels her younger days coming back. What is her name? "What\'s yours?" she asks the man after their feet hit the concrete."Huh?""Your name.""Oh. Uh, I still haven\'t gotten there." They jump to another roof. "I\'m just starting to remember my profession. I think I was… like a bartender or something? Or a waiter?" Another roof. "No, definitely a bartender. I worked behind a counter." Another jump. "What about you?""I was a mathematician, I think. And a highschool teacher. I taught English. Whoop!" She makes that sound after every leap. "I used to go to the gym on the weekends, but I stopped a couple years in. Teaching is exercise in and of itself. Whoop!"The man laughs. "Why are you making that noise?""It\'s fun! Whoop! Wait, wait, I think I\'m remembering my name…"They stop in their tracks. The building they are standing on is only a few feet tall. The man climbs down to the ground and helps the woman on the way down."Thanks," she says."You\'re welcome. Are you remembering your name?""No, it just fleeted away. I think it was Chloe or something.""Then I\'ll call you Chloe for now."Chloe for now nods in approval, and scans the street. On the wall opposite them a graffito boasts the words "CONTUMELIIS AFFICIUNT" followed by a series of seemingly unrelated letters and apostrophes."Hey, uh, what is… Zack-ath-ac-arus? Zackathacarus? Ksacathacarus?""Hmm," muses the man. "That name sounds familiar.""Is it your name?""Yeesh, I hope not. I don\'t think it is though. Do I look like a Zack?""You\'re too old to be a Zack." She giggles."Yeah, that\'s… thanks." The old man\'s decrepit belly rumbles. "Man, I\'m starved. Wanna go get something to eat?""Sure."The pair begin searching for a restaurant around the area. A restaurant is a lot like one\'s soul—if you give it money, it feeds you. Or, uh, if it gets no money, it\'ll either disappear or relocate, but you\'ll only know which once it\'s already happened. I don\'t know. A restaurant is similar to a soul in lots of ways. You could even say that what these two are doing right now is… **soul-searching**.The walls of this seemingly abandoned street are covered in graffiti, with the threatening capitalized message reappearing many times in different styles, colors and fonts. *CONTUMELIIS AFFICIUNT XAKH\'ATH\'AKH\'ARUS*. Sometimes there is only one I in the first word; sometimes the apostrophes are missing from the third; but the same tone of urgency and hatred is shared among them all."Say," says Chloe (for now), "where do you think all the—where are you?" She looks around the place, but the man seems to have vanished without a trace. Perhaps he was never there at all, and was simply a figment of her lonely imagination. "Sigh," she says, leaning back on a wall of text. "One day…" She doesn\'t feel that hungry anymore. In fact she was never hungry—she just didn\'t want that strange man to leave her. But now he has, and she\'s left with nothing to do and nowhere to go. So what should she do?Well, as the great Empedocles once said, "When there is nothing left to do, wait." So she makes herself comfortable in the corner of the alley and sets to work. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi, four Mississippi, five Mississippi, six Mississippi, seven Mississippi, eight Mississippi, nine Mississippi, ten Mississippi, eleven Mississippi, twelve Mississippi, thirteen Mississippi, fourteen Mississippi, fifteen Mississippi, sixteen Mississippi, seventeen Mississippi, eighteen Mississippi, nineteen Mississippi, twenty Mississippi, twenty-one Mississippi, twenty-two Mississippi, twenty-three Mississippi, twenty-four Mississippi, twenty-five Mississippi, twenty-six Mississippi, twenty-seven Mississippi, twenty-eight Mississippi, twenty-nine Mississippi, thirty Mississippi, thirty-one Mississippi, thirty-two Mississippi, thirty-three Mississippi, thirty-four Mississippi, thirty-five Mississippi, thirty-six Mississippi, thirty-seven Mississippi, thirty-eight Mississippi, thirty-nine Mississippi, forty Mississippi, forty-one Mississippi, forty-two Mississippi, forty-three Mississippi, forty-four Mississippi, forty-five Mississippi, forty-six Mississippi, forty-seven Mississippi, forty-eight Mississippi, forty-nine Mississippi, fifty Mississippi, fifty-one Mississippi, fifty-two Mississippi, fifty-three Mississippi, fifty-four Mississippi, fifty-five Mississippi, fifty-six Mississippi, fifty-seven Mississippi—Suddenly, she is struck with a brilliant idea. Instead of counting one Mississippi at a regular interval, in this case once per second or so, she instead can count at an accelerating rate, such that the pause between each Mississippi is halved in time after every Mississippi. If she began with one Mississippi in one minute, she would then count the next one in half a minute, and the next in a quarter of a minute, the next in an eighth of a minute, then a sixteenth, a thirty-second, a sixty-fourth, a hundred-and-twenty-eighth, a two-hundred-and-fifty-sixth, a five-hundred-and-twelfth, a thousand-and-twenty-fourth, a two-thousand-and-forty-eighth, a four-thousand-and-ninety-sixth, an eight-thousand-one-hundred-and-ninety-second, a sixteen-thousand-three-hundred-and-eighty-fourth, and so on! Since the sum of all non-positive powers of 2 is, indeed, 2, to her it would seem as if no more than 2 minutes had passed, but to the outside world…?Excited by this notion, Chloe wastes no time and picks up an outrageously convenient stopwatch from the dirty cement. Surprisingly, and again, conveniently, it still works."Mississippi."She starts a timer and sits right back down, her face staring inches from the screen. As the seconds begin to pile up, a thought occurs to her—what if instead of saying the word "Mississippi" after every count, she instead would alternate between "Mississippi" and "Elephant"? If she does, the question arises—what would she say on the last count? Of course, since she would do this infinitely many times, there isn\'t really a "final" count—and yet, there is a very specifically defined point at which she literally stops counting, since at said point she would have counted infinitely many times. It makes no sense that her last count would be a Mississippi, since every Mississippi is followed by an Elephant, and neither does it make any sense that the last count would be an Elephant, because every Elephant is followed by a Mississippi.1 minute. "Elephant." It seems there is only one way to find out, she thinks, delightfully thrilled.Another thought occurs to her. After a good number of counts, would she still be able to keep up with the timer? Mississippi and Elephant are long words—both 3.5 syllables long. The average speaking speed is around 4 to 5 syllables a second, meaning in roughly five counts, she would have to significantly up her talking speed. The world record for the fastest talking speed, in your time, was 15 syllables per second, at least on average.30 seconds. "Mississippi."It is most fortunate, then, that she suddenly remembers it was her who broke the world record, a long, long time ago, when she accidentally uttered the word "a" in infinitesimal time during a lecture. A record-obsessed audio engineer had attended that lecture, recorded her voice, and after years of rigorous analysis, confirmed that she had indeed spoken at a speed of ∞ syllables per second.15 seconds. "Elephant."So it is indeed possible, she realizes, but she has only ever done this once in her lifetime. Now, she shall have to do it infinitely many times. Infinity times infinitesimal time equals two minutes.7.5 seconds. "Mississippi."Of course, back in old time, there was already a shortest possible unit of time—the Planck time, which is unfortunately only finitely short. Still, it\'s quite remarkable just how short it is. It\'s a bit difficult to visualize its incredible briefness, but here\'s an attempt:3.75 seconds. "Elephant."Let\'s say we count one second, and in each Planck time during that second we place a single grain of sand on the ground.1.875 seconds. "Mississippi."By the time we finish counting that one second, we\'ll have a whole lot of sand at our hands. How much, do you reckon? Enough to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool? Perhaps even the Grand Canyon? The entire state of New Mexico?0.9375 seconds. "Elephant."Actually, it turns out we would have enough sand to make a true-scale sand replica of our Sun… 1,600 times.0.46875 seconds. "Mississippi."We would still have some sand left over, enough to make 45 trillion replicas of all the planets in the solar system…0.234375 seconds. "Elephant."…and then, if you\'re feeling patriotic, 7 million sand-made copies of both the Earth and the Moon, and finally after that…0.1171875 seconds. "Mississippi."…well, you would still have a shit load of sand, more than you could possibly imagine. I just ran out of analogies.0.05859375 seconds. "Elephant."I think my point was that there\'s a lot of sand in the world and not enough people to mold it.0.029296875 seconds. "Mississippi."If we all molded sand every day of the week, imagine how great that would be.0.0146484375 seconds. "Elephant."We could make a new species, made entirely of sand, and have it succeed us humans when we succumb to Mother Earth\'s kiss of extinction.0.00732421875 seconds. "Mississippi."I\'m sure the sand people would be fine.0.003662109375 seconds. "Elephant."Anyway, these Mississippi\'s and Elephant\'s are getting quite short, aren\'t they?0.0018310546875 seconds. "Mississippi."I think you get the point. Let\'s skip forward.###ONE ETERNITY LATER0 seconds. "Maleficent."Chloe opens her eyes slowly. She\'s in a different place now. The graffiti is gone. In fact, the whole weird grey Latin town is gone. She is now in a silent, barren desert, not a single indication of any kind of life as far as the eye can see. Just dunes. Horrible, unemotional, unresponsive dunes. Everywhere."Oh," she says quietly. "Oh, no. No, no, no, this can\'t be! Did I just…" She searches for something to kick at, but the ground is nothing more than sand. So she kicks the sand. "Fuck! I\'m a fucking idiot. God fucking damnit." She sighs and sits down on the sand. The watch is still there—it reads 2:34. She stops the timer and flings it away from her."Ow!" She turns around. From below the dune, that strange man she saw in the grey town emerges, holding the stopwatch in his one hand and rubbing his face with the other. "We should keep this, you know. It might come in handy."Her eyes light up, and the next moment she bolts at him and wraps her arms around him. "Oh my god, I thought I\'d lost you forever!"He smiles and returns a hug. "No. I\'m starting to get this place. People don\'t disappear here—they just live in different times.""What do you mean?""How did you get here? Did you do the halving-time trick?""Yeah. How did you know?""I don\'t think there\'s any other way to skip eternities other than that.""No, I mean… how did you know it would work? The supertask? You didn\'t say you\'re a mathematician, or a philosopher.""Well, no, but being a bartender means you hear a few nerdy jokes here and there. I try to learn what I can. There\'s this one joke—come on, let\'s go.""What? Where? There\'s nothing but sand in this whole place.""Nah, I was in a western town just some time ago. I\'m sure we\'ll find it in a sec."She scouts the area again. Not a single man-made or animal-made building anywhere, at least as far as she can see."C\'mon!" The man begins walking, and Chloe comes to his side."How long have you been in this place?""Uh, a few weeks, I\'d say? It\'s hard to keep time. These stopwatches aren\'t a dime a dozen." He drops the timepiece into his pocket and zips it up."And you waited… in this exact spot?""Nah, I went to get some drinks. Here." He hands her a bottle of water. It\'s warm. "The folks at that place were real nice. Hope we can find them again."Chloe takes a sip, but then she realizes she\'s not thirsty yet. "Why did you come back, then? Why didn\'t you stay there?""Well, I figured you\'d pop up eventually. You seemed smart, and, uh, I guess I didn\'t really want to lose you."She pauses and looks at him. He returns a modest smile."Thanks," she says quietly."No problemo."The pair stroll for some time, and although Chloe doubts he really knows where he\'s going, she begins to feel quite comfortable at his side. "Do you remember your name now?" she eventually asks."Oh, yeah. I forgot to mention it. It\'s Bart Ender."She laughs. "Sure it is.""God, I wish. That\'d be awesome. Nah, my actual name is Brian van der Ende.""Cute. Are you Dutch?""I guess so. I don\'t remember any of my childhood. All I remember from my past life is that I was a bartender. I guess that was more important to me than anything else. What about you?""Oh, I haven\'t had that much time to recollect, but… I think my name is Clie. But I don\'t remember much else.""Okay. Nice to meet you, Clie." He holds out his hand."Nice to meet you too," she says and shakes his hand, "Brian.""Please. Just Bart.""Bart."He smiles in approval and takes a scan around the area. "Okay, we are definitely lost. Darn."Clie sighs nihilistic-like, aye. "What are we gonna do?""Well," he says and sits on the ground, "as the famous Aristotle once said, \'When you\'re out of ideas, wait.\'"She sits on the ground beside him. "Did he actually say that?""What? \'Course not, silly. It was in Greek." He pulls out the stopwatch. "How long do you wait for the first one?""Just a minute.""A minute? Why not, like, 10 seconds?""I guess that works too."He turns on the stopwatch and watches the watch wash away the first second, the second second, and so on.20 seconds later, they\'re gone.That was quick.#TO BE CONTINUED'],nothing
